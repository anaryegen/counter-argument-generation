Jewish people make up about 2% of the American population, yet their political influence in the US far outweighs their voting power, as evidenced by the importance of the Israel issue in US politics. This disproportionate influence is puzzling, especially when compared to other groups with similar population percentages, such as Native Americans, Mormons, and Muslims. The author, who is Jewish, is seeking reasonable explanations for this power disparity.
The violent retribution, such as the death penalty, vigilante justice, and prison violence, is morally wrong. It is impossible to know for sure who is guilty, it does not rehabilitate or deter criminals, more harm can be done than intended, and nobody "deserves" violent punishment. The justice should focus on rehabilitation, protecting society, and deterring future crime, rather than punishment.
All high schools should have a mandatory law class that teaches students about laws, their rights, and punishments. This class would serve three purposes: informing students of laws to avoid unintentional violations, making them aware of their rights to prevent police abuse, and deterring crime by educating them on punishments. The budget cuts should be made nationwide to implement this program.
The Idaho Stop law allows bicyclists to treat stop signs as yield signs and red lights as stop signs, enabling them to avoid frequent stops and starts. This law would make common cycling behavior, such as running stop signs on empty streets, legal. Adopting this law could benefit society by reducing emissions, increasing road space, and promoting community health.
The law restricting activities such as the sale of alcohol on Easter have no place in a modern secular country. In Australia, where I am currently located, state law prohibits going out for a drink on Good Friday, a restriction I believe is an attempt to impose Christian observances on the wider population. Such laws are also found in other secular countries, such as Germany, which has a similar law known as the Tanzverbot.
In most common law countries, including the USA, the legal concept of the "right to silence" or "not be witness against himself" exists, protected by the 5th amendment of the US Constitution. However, this protection only applies when testifying could be self-incriminating, with the reasoning behind it being rooted in medieval torture used to elicit false confessions. The author questions why this protection exists in modern trials, suggesting a more specific solution, such as invalidating confessions involving torture, rather than a total protection from testifying.
The principle of religious freedom in the US is a red herring, as the country does not recognize official religions or spokespeople, and each person's religion is defined individually. The actual debate is about the freedoms of association and conscience, with the "right" arguing for their respect and the "left" arguing against it. Both sides should be more honest about the implications of their positions, with the "right" acknowledging that their arguments apply to all anti-discrimination laws and the "left" acknowledging that their arguments could lead to the government requiring association with people they find distasteful.
The F-35 program is considered a modern-day equivalent of the Maginot Line, a massive investment that may become obsolete before it sees combat due to the rise of drones in aerial combat. The program has faced numerous cost overruns, with a projected total cost of over $1.3 trillion, and is years behind schedule. I think that drones will soon surpass human pilots in various aspects, including cost, reaction time, and maneuverability, making the F-35 investment potentially unnecessary.
Military desertion should not be considered a crime as it is a normal human behavior and can be seen as a form of freedom of speech and action. Prosecution of desertion can be viewed as external coercion that contradicts freedom of action. Many modern countries exempt pacifists from military service, making it illogical to prosecute those who regret violent intervention after the fact.
I am an American nationalist and I support using government power to ensure domestic energy production, creating jobs and reducing dependence on other nations. I also believe that allowing corporations to manufacture goods overseas puts America at risk and contributes to trade deficits. 
I believe that crisis simulations would be a more effective way to assess presidential candidates than debates.  In a crisis simulation, candidates would be evaluated on how they assess situations, handle disagreements, and demonstrate their knowledge of government.  This method is used in other high-responsibility fields, such as astronaut training, and could potentially be adopted in future election cycles, possibly starting with lesser-known candidates seeking publicity.
The slippery slope argument does not apply to well-defined, small bodies of authority, such as individual moderators or teams, when it comes to making social changes, like banning certain content on Reddit. They claim that these groups will make a specific change, like banning racism, but it's unlikely to lead to a sudden change of heart and further bans. There is no mechanism for a slippery slope to occur when individuals with their own beliefs make decisions.
Increasing privilege for everyone is not possible without those who are currently benefiting losing some of their advantages, and that people only pay lip service to values like equality and fairness without being willing to make real sacrifices. When faced with the choice, most people will prioritize protecting their own privileged position rather than fighting for equality.
Global commerce and strong trade ties between countries make another world war unlikely, unless there is a global market collapse. The interconnectedness of the global economy, facilitated by easy travel, shipping, and communication, has contributed to the current peaceful state of the world. This is evident in strong trade relationships, such as between China and the US/European countries, which would be too costly to abandon.
97% of Planned Parenthood's work is not abortions, but rather services such as STD and cancer screenings, contraception, and HIV counseling. The organization does not "sell" body parts, but rather allows patients to donate fetal tissue to science if they wish. Planned Parenthood is reimbursed for costs such as transportation, not for selling body parts.
Small countries in Europe should unite as a single nation, like the US, and eventually all small countries should become large, united territories. 
The same arguments used to justify civilians owning assault weaponry can also be used to justify access to surface-to-air missiles and heavy artillery. The notion of civilians being able to defend themselves against a tyrannical government with assault rifles is "beyond laughable" in the age of advanced military technology. Unless civilians are allowed to arm themselves with artillery and missiles, the argument for owning assault weaponry is not valid.
If someone chooses not to participate in elections, they have no right to complain about the results. By not voting, one is essentially allowing someone they oppose to win with less competition. Someone will win regardless, and that not voting means giving up one's say in the government.
The US government is untrustworthy and giving it more power is insane. The government has a history of deception, including loading a civilian ship with munitions to provoke war, lying about the Gulf of Tonkin incident to enter the Vietnam War, and using false testimony to enter the Gulf War. The government's involvement in MKUltra also raises concerns about its trustworthiness.
According to the originalist interpretation of the 8th Amendment, any bail or fine considered excessive in 1791 should be considered unconstitutional today. If this logic is applied consistently, the excessive bail and fines clauses should also be interpreted as forbidding a discrete set of bail amounts and fines that were considered excessive in 1791, without taking inflation into account.
The American military is often praised for keeping the country free, but this notion is questionable, as there have been no large-scale operations since World War II that were fought for American freedom. Military operations in the past two decades have been offensive and have not benefited the country. The public's perception of the military should shift from admiration to empathy for the soldiers who have limited options and are often used as pawns in politicians' games.
Insular communities, such as the Haredi, Hasidim, Amish, and FLDS sects, enforce social rules based on centuries past, including strict dress codes, limited contact with the outside world, and harsh punishments for rule-breakers. These communities often contradict core American values, such as individualism, democracy, equality, fairness, and privacy. Women are not treated equally, punishment is not fair, and rule is by a small, religious elite in these communities.
The saying "with all things equal I would rather be born white" is not a racist statement, as it implies that being white is inherently better than being black. I have never heard a black person express a desire to be born white, for example an interview with Ta-Nehisi Coats, who speaks positively about the beauty and richness of the black experience. I think that such statements diminish the value of being born black and can be rephrased as "white is better than black".
Many victims of police shootings could have prevented their deaths by complying with officers' orders, and therefore, they don't deserve sympathy for their behavior. Exercising poor judgment and failing to comply with officers' orders is often the common problem in such incidents. 
The Kurds are the only group in the Middle East with moral high ground and that Western nations should form an alliance with them. The Kurds are seen as champions of Western values, such as women's rights, and have shown a willingness to help other ethnic minorities, including the Yazidis. In contrast, their political opponents, including Turkey, have been shown to be "monsters" who engage in ideological violence and human rights abuses.
Lying to the FBI should only be a crime if it actually covers up something, but currently it is a felony to make any materially False statement to a federal agent, carrying a maximum sentence of up to five years in prison. The government often abuses this law to gain leverage over defendants by asking questions they know the answer to, hoping the person will lie, and then charging them with a felony. The penalty should be less severe, such as a misdemeanor, and the crime should only apply if the Falsehood actually impeded an investigation in a meaningful manner.
Food past recommended daily values should be heavily taxed, as overeating is a major problem that leads to health issues and costs money in healthcare. I propose a system where individuals would be encouraged to eat the proper amount of food, as calculated by a doctor's visit, and those who choose to eat excessively would be taxed to support the system and fund welfare programs.
Innocent detainees accused of terrorism are justified in escaping captivity due to lack of due process rights. The right to freedom and to petition the government for justification of incarceration are considered fundamental human rights. If an innocent person escapes under these circumstances, they should be forgiven by any subsequent administration.
The USA is the least trustworthy nation to possess atomic weapons due to its history of using them against an enemy and its tendency to start new wars. The USA's past use of atomic bombs demonstrates a lower bar for considering their use, making it more likely to use them again. The USA's involvement in wars increases the likelihood of it finding itself in a situation where it would consider using another atomic bomb.
I am a self-described socially liberal individual, I think the social justice warrior (SJW) movement uses language that is exclusive to the elite and privileged, making it inaccessible to those who are economically and educationally marginalized. This language, which includes terms such as "patriarchy" and "cisgendered," can be intimidating and alienating to those who are not familiar with it, and can make them feel stupid or ignorant. I believe that this approach does more to silence non-privileged voices than to encourage education, empowerment, and progress.
I am a former infantry sergeant with 2 combat deployments, is concerned that the military's plan to integrate women into combat arms by 2016 may lead to a lowering of standards, putting lives at risk. I believe that if women are allowed to meet a lower standard, it will create a stigma and undermine their achievements. The combat requires more than just shooting a gun, but also physical endurance, and that changing the standard will not change the realities of war.
The US government should provide every citizen with a personal retirement fund, starting with a lump sum at birth or naturalization, invested in an index fund and accessible tax-free at age 65. This would require an annual program cost of around $5 billion, plus administrative costs, and a one-time payment of $300 billion to include current citizens. The fund would help people retire with dignity, encourage future investments, and provide a guaranteed savings at retirement, leveraging a small initial investment over a long time frame to yield significant future benefits.
Individuals who are positively identified and convicted of armed robbery or home invasion should be put to death, as they have demonstrated a fundamental defect in their human brain chemistry and a willingness to cause harm to innocent people for short-term gain. This view is based on the extreme depravity of such crimes, which involve the use of lethal weapons and can cause significant trauma and psychological damage to victims.
The "Hispanic question" is the most important racial issue in the USA, surpassing racism against blacks. I believe that racism against Hispanics makes no logical sense and is morally wrong, particularly given the significant contributions Hispanics are making to the US economy and culture. I propose several measures to address this issue, including stronger social taboos against discrimination, adding Spanish as a required subject in K-12 education, and making Spanish the de facto second official language of the US.
Politicians, specifically presidential election candidates, deserve to be taken out of context due to the sound-bite culture of modern American media. Hillary Clinton was criticized for a comment about white people's fear of young black men in hoodies, but she is responsible for creating a problematic soundbite despite her experience and resources. 
Racism is not based on skin color, but rather on differences in cultures, and that it is not worth getting rid of because it would require blending cultures too much, leading to a loss of diversity. 
People who publicly expose cybersecurity breaches should be encouraged and not punished the same as those who exploit the breaches for personal gain. This is because the person who publishes the breach is taking a greater risk of getting caught and is also providing a public service by alerting the company and the public to the vulnerability. This approach would lead to fewer instances of stolen data being shared on the dark web.
The US government should assist people in moving out of drought-stricken areas, as it would be cheaper and safer in the long run than waiting. The move could stimulate economic growth in the new locations, loosen the demands on the drought-stricken areas, and provide relief to the affected populations.
The European left, represented by parties such as the British Labour and the German SPD, has failed to maintain its role as "people's parties" due to significant losses and inability to address worsening economic situations for many citizens. The left parties have failed to come up with a solution to the widening gap between rich and poor and have been outmaneuvered by conservative and right-wing parties that have adopted traditional left-wing policies. The traditional left ideals, including social liberalism and protection of minorities, are no longer resonating with many people, allowing right-wing parties to capitalize on the situation.
No one should be denied a job due to a mental illness, regardless of the profession, including police officers, military personnel, and doctors. Some professions may ask about mental illness on applications, and some people believe certain jobs are too important for individuals with mental health conditions. However, advocates for discrimination against the mentally ill are misinformed, as mentally ill individuals have the same rights as everyone else and are no more violent than the average person.
I am a soon-to-be vegan and I think that eating meat is equivalent to murder. If it's unethical for a human to kill another human or for an alien to kill a human, then it should also be unethical to kill conscious, pain-feeling animals. 
I do not believe that raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour will help Americans, as I think it will lead to job losses, reduced job availability, and increased reliance on automation. Entry-level jobs, such as those in fast food, should not be viable career choices and that making them livable wages will harm the economy and American workforce. 
Universities should not be required to adjudicate sexual assault claims as it is the government's job to prosecute crimes, not colleges. Colleges lack the resources and institutional structure to handle serious felony investigations and often disregard core due process rights, making their proceedings resemble kangaroo courts. The government should not force public or private universities to sanction students based on criminal accusations without due process.
The media plays a crucial role in providing coverage of mass killing perpetrators, as it allows for a public conversation about the dangerous ideologies and mindsets that fuel these acts. While media outlets often sensationalize stories for ratings, some provide a social service by informing the public about current issues and shedding light on problematic views, such as racism, misogyny, and radical religious ideologies. This coverage also provides an opportunity to discuss related issues like gun control and mental health.
Capitalism is the best economic option, as it is a free market regulated by the state that allows individuals to become self-made millionaires. A just and non-corrupt state is necessary for a successful capitalist environment. Communism, on the other hand, interferes with individual freewill and kills incentives, while a laissez-faire system is unattainable due to human nature.
The requirement that a US presidential candidate must be a natural-born American citizen is seen as hypocritical and potentially detrimental, given the country's history of being built by immigrants. 
I disagree with the prison-industrial complex, considering many laws arbitrary and long-term incarceration to cause further social harm. As an alternative, they suggest shaming, shunning, and exile, which could be more effective in preventing crime and allow for more democratic punishment. This approach would require social cohesion and reform, but could potentially be a more sustainable and tolerable way to address crime.
The concept of "freedom of speech" is often misinterpreted and used in contexts it was not intended for. The author believes that "freedom of speech" does not mean that anyone is required to listen to or give a platform to someone's views, nor does it mean freedom from consequences or the right to break the law with impunity. The author argues that the concept of "freedom of speech" only applies to government censorship, as stated in the First Amendment.
Both libertarianism and communism are based on the flawed assumption that people are not selfish. In reality, humans are self-serving, and without financial incentives, entrepreneurs and skilled workers will seek opportunities elsewhere, and charity alone cannot replace government programs for the poor. A combination of capitalism and tax-funded social services is a more practical and desirable model for a society.
Spamming public forums should be considered a crime and suggests measures to track down and penalize spammers, including revoking their hosting and ISP services, blocking their websites, and imposing community service or fines. Current lack of consequences for spamming leads to continued abuse of public forums. 
I believe we should carry a concealed handgun due to their ability to remain calm and responsible in high-pressure situations, demonstrated by their 15-year experience working with individuals with special needs and severe behavior disorders. I am not a "gun guy" and support stricter gun control, but feel that relying on myself is more dependable than waiting for laws to change. If we were in a dangerous situation, such as a mass shooting, I would be a trustworthy person to have nearby, armed and able to respond.
The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is a more effective policy tool for fighting poverty than raising the minimum wage. Unlike the minimum wage, the EITC is pro-market, doesn't have negative employment effects, and won't lead to higher prices. The EITC allows for targeting those who need help, such as low-income individuals supporting themselves or their families, and is paid for by society as a whole, making it a more optimal tool for fighting poverty.
As a European, I disagree with raising the minimum wage based on my observations of the US job market, where a lower minimum wage allows for more hiring. I believe that raising the minimum wage will result in job losses, especially for the poorest and least desirable employees.
White people owe black people a tremendous debt due to centuries of slavery, systemic oppression, and exploitation that has led to unearned advantages for white people. The wealth and privileges enjoyed by white people today are a direct result of the suffering and labor of black people, who were forced to build the foundation of the United States. 
Marijuana use has several health drawbacks, including slowed brain function, dulled reflexes, and potential brain irregularities, making it a bad idea to use recreationally. Marijuana should be allowed for medicinal purposes, such as for people with seizures or PTSD, but not for recreational use.
Donald Trump's platform shares similarities with fascism, as it promotes corporate welfare, military aggression, and ethnic supremacism, similar to the ideologies of Mussolini, Hitler, and Franco. I identify as left-leaning, and may be I am unfairly labeling Trump as a fascist, but I believe that Trump's views on Mexicans, foreign policy, and the billionaire class align with fascist ideologies. 
The implementation of an efficient and widespread camera surveillance system, called. The benefits of such a system would include the disappearance of certain crimes, reduced need for locks and alarms, cheaper real estate, and increased economic activity.
I propose that the US confiscate the estimated $32 trillion hidden in tax havens, which could be put to better use than its current purposes of tax dodging, white-collar crime, and money laundering. I suggest a plan for distributing the confiscated funds, including allocating 53% to zeroing out the total US government debt, 7% to rebuilding infrastructure, and 25% to securing Medicare and Social Security. This plan would leave the US in a strong financial position. 
Insurance companies should be able to disqualify people with pre-existing conditions as it is a bad investment for them. Ccompanies exist to make a profit and don't have a moral obligation to help anyone, and that the government should step in to insure people with poor health instead of forcing companies to make bad investments. I view insurance companies as businesses that prioritize making money over being compassionate or helping people.
Google is the most powerful company in the Western world due to its control over the most widely used search engine, which gives it the ability to manipulate search results and influence public opinion. In theory, Google could be pressured by governments to skew search results to support their interests, such as during a war, and its control over the flow of information could be used to manipulate public opinion.
The EU is unsustainable and steps should be taken towards disbanding, as the eurozone is bad for European economies. The lack of control over their own currency is causing economic struggles, as seen in Finland's 10% unemployment rate and Greece's crisis, which could have been better handled with their own currency. Countries with their own currency, such as the US, are better prepared to handle recessions and adjust their currency value.
The Chattanooga shootings on July 16, 2015, resulted in the deaths of four service members and the wounding of two others, with the gunman, Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez, being killed by police. I do not consider this an act of terrorism, but rather an attack on a military target, drawing a parallel to US military drone strikes on enemy training grounds. I believe that terrorist attacks are unjustifiable strikes against non-combatants, and that the Chattanooga attacks were something different.
Marriage equality as a concept that reinforces societal oppression and normalization, rather than true liberation. Gay community's fight for marriage rights is a fight for justice and rights defined by their oppressors, making marriage a tool of social oppression. Comparing to the end of slavery in the US, where "marriage equality" would be equivalent to allowing black people to own slaves, rather than abolishing slavery altogether.
I initially supported Bernie Sanders but now I think Donald Trump would make a better president, particularly in addressing issues like the shrinking middle class, political corruption, and national security. I believe Trump's negotiating skills and wealth make him less susceptible to corruption and more effective in creating jobs and solving national security threats. 
My understanding of Keynesian economics is that a policy prescription that benefits the working class and penalizes the wealthy, and wonders if this is a form of class warfare. The theory's approach to stimulating economic growth through government spending and taxation, and question whether this is inherently biased towards the poor and against the rich. 
There should be no restrictions on immigration, allowing people to migrate freely between countries with minimal requirements such as a passport and customs check. Immigration restrictions are immoral and selfish, and they can actually benefit the economy by increasing the workforce, filling skill gaps, and reducing the impact of industry bubbles. Additionally, immigrants do not "steal jobs" from native citizens, but rather increase economic activity and create new job opportunities.
82% of people dislike political attack ads, which are mainly effective in reminding supporters to vote rather than persuading undecided voters. Compulsory voting would likely reduce the number of attack ads as they would be less effective. Australia's compulsory voting system as an example.
Welfare recipients should be required to receive IUDs, as it would offer similar advantages to eugenics while resolving ethical concerns. The program would also prioritize research into a male equivalent treatment and provide free IUDs, with regular checkups to prevent tampering. Those with religious objections would not be eligible for state welfare, but could potentially receive support from their religious institutions.
Climate change should be the dominant international issue for politicians and activists today as scientists widely accept its reality and predict extreme weather, sea level rise, and ecosystem destruction. The effects of climate change will impact human well-being, displace coastal settlements, and destroy ecosystems. 
A president who literally does nothing would be a positive thing as old laws would not get renewed and it would be much harder to pass new laws without the president's signature. Many laws have sunset provisions, requiring renewal by a certain time, and the president's inaction would allow these laws to expire. This would result in fewer new laws being passed and older laws expiring, with the president's lack of action being the catalyst for these changes.
The Empire should have continued using clone troopers alongside a conscription army, as the clones' accelerated aging process and potential for high casualty rates could be mitigated by supplementing them with drafted soldiers. The clone program could have provided trillions of soldiers, making it a valuable asset worth retaining.
As a German, I believe that excessive immigration hurts a country's culture, citing my own experiences in my city where we feel Germans are outnumbered and made fun of by foreigners, particularly Turks, Muslims, and Eastern Europeans. While some immigration is harmless, an overwhelming number of immigrants can be problematic. My  concern is not driven by racism, but rather a desire to preserve my native culture.
The UK's current ban on fox-hunting with dogs is inconsistent and nonsensical, as it allows for other forms of fox killing, such as snaring and poisoning, which can be more inhumane than being hunted by dogs. The ban does not effectively prevent animal cruelty, but rather seems to target the upper-class practitioners of fox-hunting as a form of "class warfare".
Equal treatment and opportunities for all can be dangerous for society in the long run, as it allows those who are not naturally suited for leadership and power to reach positions where they can cause harm. Those in control and power are there for a reason, and allowing the weak to take control can have disastrous consequences.
I suggest moving federal real estate holdings into a real estate investment trust to better manage them. The trust would charge market-rate rent to users and pay dividends to the treasury, providing a more accurate accounting of agencies'property use and allowing for more efficient budgeting. This system would also provide political insulation to raise rates to market levels, with possible exceptions for national security or a separate military REIT.
If Napoleon had won at Waterloo and completed his conquest of Europe, the continent would have flourished economically, socially, and politically. Napoleon's domestic reforms, such as the Code Napoleon and his educational system, are examples of his positive impact on France and potentially the rest of Europe. Napoleon was not a warmonger and that his leadership would have allowed liberalism to thrive in Europe, leading to benefits such as the abolition of slavery and the promotion of meritocracy.
Most Americans lack a genuine understanding of society and politics, often voting without researching candidates or understanding the implications of their decisions. This lack of awareness allows politicians to be corrupt and for corporate interests to influence elections. If people are not willing to vote for real reform, then the corporate elite may as well control the process.
The Supreme Court has the most political power in the US government, with the ability to judge the legality of actions by the legislative and executive branches. The court also has the power to overturn state laws and create laws deemed "necessary and proper" through the "elastic clause". Additionally, justices have life tenure, making them nearly unaccountable, as no justice has been successfully impeached in US history.
The Confederate flag is not comparable to the swastika, as the swastika is an integral part of Hindu culture, whereas the Confederate flag is not an integral part of any culture. Banning the swastika would be an attack on Hinduism, whereas banning the Confederate flag does not have the same cultural implications. 
Nationalism is the best way to ensure diversity and mutual respect among ethnic and national backgrounds, as opposed to globalism, which they argue leads to a loss of cultural identity and "whitewashing". The importance of distinguishing between racial and national nationalism, and argue that national pride and identity are essential for all nationalities, especially oppressed groups. 
Socialism is fundamentally better than capitalism, defining socialism as a system where the government owns the means of production and provides necessities like food, water, shelter, education, and healthcare for free to all citizens who contribute. Capitalism ensures exploitation of the lower classes, causes enormous waste, and is bad for the environment, while socialism prevents needless death and suffering, ends cyclical poverty, and is better for rewarding hard work and protecting the environment.
Protesters who throw Molotov cocktails at police should be met with deadly force, as this tactic is deadly and intended to cause harm. The use of Molotov cocktails is a premeditated act, rather than a result of groupthink, and is not a legitimate form of protest. Riot police should respond with deadly force to protect themselves from the risk of burning to death.
I, from Singapore, believe that a country's peace and economic prosperity should take precedence over human rights, such as freedom of speech and individual privacy. Singapore's rapid growth from a third-world to a first-world country was partly due to the government's prioritization of economic prosperity and peace over human rights, country's media control as an example. Sacrificing some human rights is a necessary evil to maintain peace and economic prosperity, a view shared by many Singaporeans who feel that government monitoring is justified if it catches "bad people" and maintains social harmony.
The Greeks are resisting the EU's austerity measures imposed due to their country's increasing debt problems, with some even boycotting German goods and drawing Nazi comparisons. They have been living beyond their means and are now facing a decrease in their quality of life, which they have grown accustomed to under the euro. 
Voting for a party that has a higher chance of winning, even if it's not their top choice, is a more "useful" vote. However, this approach leads to centrist parties having inflated results and a distorted representation of the population's views. If everyone voted selfishly for their preferred party, the outcome would be best for the entire population, but people are held back from doing so because others don't.
The current focus on income equality in capitalist systems is limited, as it overlooks the importance of wealth and how individuals use and save their money. Even if incomes were evened out, there would still be a significant gap between those who manage their finances responsibly and those who do not. Wealth is not solely determined by income, but also by how individuals save, spend, and use their money, with good habits being crucial for achieving lasting wealth.
Piracy is largely indefensible and stems from a selfish desire for free entertainment, ultimately hurting small-time artists. Piracy is a violation of property rights and the theft of luxuries, which are not necessary for survival or well-being.
Iran is unlikely to attempt to build a nuclear weapon in the near future because the threat of a US attack, which previously motivated them to seek a nuclear deterrent, no longer exists. In the early 2000s, Iran had a strong reason to want a nuclear weapon due to the US naming them as part of the "axis of evil" and openly discussing the possibility of invasion. With the US having made a comprehensive deal with Iran, they no longer have a motivation to acquire a nuclear weapon.
The use of steroids for aesthetic reasons is not wrong, as long as the individual is not competing in a sport or selling workout DVDs. If it's their own body and they're not competing, there's no reason why steroid use shouldn't be acceptable and legal. If legalized, steroid use could be regulated by government agencies or private testing firms, rather than being forced underground.
I am a 31-year-old male who works in the wellness industry, and I believe it is citizens' responsibility to reduce their own alcohol consumption and encourage others to do the same.
The electoral college system is outdated and has no advantages over a popular vote system, which would better reflect the will of the American public and encourage more people to vote. Current system can render votes meaningless if a person's preferred candidate is unpopular in their state. 
Libertarianism, specifically right-libertarianism, would ultimately limit individual freedom more than it would encourage it. This ideology advocates for minimal government intervention and low taxes, leading to unregulated capitalism, which has historically resulted in corporations growing to a size where fair competition is impossible and people have limited labor rights. The lack of government regulation would create a power vacuum, allowing corporations and the wealthy to gain unchecked power and make rules for people's lives, ultimately restricting individual freedom.
Sanctuary cities are dangerous because they limit the interaction between local and federal law enforcement, allowing undocumented immigrants with criminal backgrounds to roam freely. An incident in San Francisco, where a shooter was released from jail despite being wanted by ICE, highlights the risks of such policies. The city's law prohibited officials from notifying ICE before releasing the shooter, who had a 20-year-old drug charge and was wanted for multiple offenses.
The US congressional system is more representative than the Westminster parliamentary system, contrary to the prevailing opinion. Parties in Westminster systems are more homogenous and rigid, with stronger party discipline, which can lead to a lack of diversity in voting behavior. In contrast, the US congressional system allows for more flexibility and diversity in voting behavior, with examples such as the "Blue Dog Democrats" who often cross party lines.
The world would be better off if El Chapo Guzman had been extradited to the US, where he would have been kept in a more secure and less corrupt environment. His escape was facilitated by the Mexican prison system and he is responsible for thousands of deaths in the recent drug wars in Mexico. The Mexican government's refusal to extradite him has made the world worse off, allowing a major criminal to evade justice.
government officials have very little control over economic growth, and politicians who promise to " grow the economy " are either bluffing or ignorant. There are a few things they can do to influence the economy, such as tax cuts, government spending, and deficit spending, but there is no consensus on their effectiveness and many of these options are already being utilized or have limitations. 
A world government is unlikely to happen in the next centuries and even if it does, it would not last long. A world government would be impossible due to the competitive nature of the current economic system, the influence of greed, and the clash of interests between different countries and political systems. 
The root of all human conflicts is cultural difference, which creates language and behavior that excludes people and leads to clashes in values and beliefs. Conflicts arise when people's beliefs, particularly religious and political views, clash, and leaders often aggravate these differences to gain power.
Discuss politics in public, fearing it may damage relationships with others who hold opposing views, particularly in the South where there is strong opposition to recent events such as the removal of the Confederate flag and the Supreme Court's gay rights ruling. 
Showing compassion to Mexican illegal immigrants is not justified when considering the financial burden they would place on the system, as they would take more in benefits than they would pay in taxes. This argument is not based on skin color, but rather on the economic impact of a large influx of low-income workers.
I am, a European from England, view the financial crisis in Greece as a significant defeat for the left and socialist politics. I believe that the tactics employed by Tsipras and his party were cynical and reckless, and that the Greek people will bear the brunt of the consequences. The left's inability to accept that their anti-austerity platform has failed in Greece is an example of cognitive dissonance.
A police department in a mountain town should not purchase Harleys for officers, there is a need for cruisers due to heavy snowfall and the lack of dedicated bike cops. I see disadvantages to purchasing bikes, including the cost to taxpayers, limited transportation capabilities, and officer safety concerns. 
The British should have partitioned Kashmir along religious lines in 1947, allocating Muslim-majority areas to Pakistan and Hindu- and Buddhist-majority areas to India. This would have prevented the decades-long Kashmir dispute and conflict, saving tens of thousands of lives and potentially preventing Pakistan from going nuclear. The absence of the Kashmir dispute could have also led to reduced Indo-Pakistani tensions, allowing both countries to focus on economic development and cooperation instead of military spending.
Barack Obama has been an excellent president, accomplishing many remarkable things despite having an uncooperative congress. His achievements include saving the US economy, ending two long wars, killing Osama bin Laden, and making strides in healthcare reform, clean energy, and social issues. He also made significant progress in foreign relations, including normalizing relations with Cuba and reaching a nuclear deal with Iran.
Paying workers a living wage is more important than profit, as the purpose of society is to work collaboratively for the good of all, not to help businesses prosper. 
True equality can only be achieved by eliminating capitalism and inheritance, as the current system determines one's life based on their birth class. To achieve equality of opportunity, a society must ensure full employment without jeopardizing work discipline, which can only be achieved in a socialist system where workers collectively own the means of production. 
I am a liberal Bernie supporter and I think that Citizens United was rightly decided and that attempts to cap campaign donations are misguided. I believe that political donations constitute a form of political speech, which is protected by the First Amendment, and that restricting donations would be equivalent to restricting other forms of expression, such as volunteering time or wearing t-shirts with a message. 
Prostitution should be legalized as it is a person's right to do what they want with their own body, as long as it doesn't infringe on others' rights. The government's ban on prostitution is a violation of this right, and by making it illegal, it forces the industry underground, making it harder to prevent disease and protect workers' rights. 
The author proposes that America should undergo a "velvet divorce," similar to Czechoslovakia's peaceful dissolution into the Czech Republic and Slovakia in the early 1990s. The author suggests that the US is a nation divided, mired in gridlock, and that a divorce would allow the two resulting countries to pursue their respective policies without hindering each other. 
The mayor of San Francisco, Ed Lee, is responsible for the death of Kate Steinle due to his policy of not cooperating with federal law enforcement, which led to the release of Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez. Without this policy, Kate Steinle would still be alive. The federal government should take action against Lee and the city, including cutting funding, for not complying with immigration law.
Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote a letter to his son stating that the American dream is built on the backs of oppressed people, specifically black Americans, and that it cannot exist without the subjugation of others. I believe that the dream is an illusion that requires the oppression of certain groups to maintain its existence.
Bernie Sanders' campaign promises, such as free college and getting money out of politics, require congressional action, which he knows is unlikely to happen given his 18 years of experience in Congress. His platform includes items like a $15 minimum wage, closing the gender pay gap, and overturning the Citizens United decision, all of which require new legislation. Sanders' ability to accomplish his promises is highly unlikely, even if he wins the presidential election, unless like-minded Democrats win a majority in both houses of Congress.
The American two-party system is not inherently flawed and does not cause problems such as corporate influence and voter apathy. The system allows for a variety of ideologies within each party, as seen in primary elections and the differing views of politicians within the same party. Reform can be made by lessening corporate influence and making voting easier, rather than destroying the two-party system.
As a liberal, I believe that illegal immigration is a genuine problem in the US, despite some media outlets suggesting that any objection to it is inherently bigoted.
Right-wing views are selfish, as they prioritize individual success and wealth over helping those in need, while left-wing views emphasize looking after each other and sharing resources.
95 % of the time, people who claim that a current news story is a " media distraction " do not have a valid reason for what they think the media is supposedly distracting from. People often claim a news story is a media distraction because they do not like the story or its implications. 
I think that "financial abortion" or the concept of allowing men to opt out of paying child support should only be considered if a social safety net is established to support the child. According to the UN, children have specific rights that the state must ensure, and if the father opts out, the state should provide welfare to make up for the lost income. State's responsibility to care for the child if the father is not willing or able to provide financial support.
The author, a German citizen, believes that Greece should leave the Eurozone as they think the financial aid provided by Germany has been wasted and not benefited Greece. They argue that the Greek economy cannot flourish while being part of a union with a high-valued currency and that leaving the Euro would be a good start for both Greece and Europe. 
Police brutality is a serious issue, but I think that media coverage has unfairly portrayed law enforcement as a whole, creating a negative image. I believe that the media's scrutiny has exaggerated the severity of police brutality cases, and that the actions of a few "bad apples" are being unfairly attributed to all officers. This has led to increased anti-police sentiments, making it difficult for officers who are doing their job without prejudice to do so effectively.
The politicization of tragic events in the US has become inappropriate and disrespectful. For example, the recent San Francisco murder by a 6-time deported criminal. Instead of addressing the issues, both Democrats and Republicans are using the event to further their own agendas, and I think that this is disrespectful to the victim and her family. The author notes that this politicization is preventing real solutions to the issues at hand.
Increasing the minimum wage to $15/hour would ultimately hurt the lower and middle classes, despite its intended purpose of strengthening the lower class. 
The statement "freedom of speech only applies to the government" is legally accurate, but it overlooks the moral undertone of this freedom and can lead to its erosion. While hate speech and toxic attitudes should be called out, individuals and groups should not use this as an excuse to engage in mobocracy, threatening a person's livelihood or right to speak. Crossing this line can lead to "dangerous territories".
Countries should not strip people of their citizenship except in cases of fraud, as proposed or enacted laws in countries like Canada, the UK, and Australia violate core norms of liberal democratic states and create equal protection problems. These laws, such as Canada's, allow for the stripping of citizenship for acts related to terrorism or supporting foreign governments, but this punishment is often applied ex post facto and does not provide equal protection to all citizens. 
The US Constitution is not as great as it's made out to be, particularly in the modern day, due to its failure to foresee the need for changes in the future. The document's rigidity and difficulty to amend have resulted in certain rights being enshrined that are now harmful to society, while ignoring others that are more relevant. This has led to the US potentially becoming backward compared to other countries with modern founding documents and laws.
Lenders, such as banks, have a responsibility to assess and verify the borrower's situation before providing a loan, and the borrower has no moral obligation to repay the loan if they are willing to accept the consequences.
Objecting to the building of a mosque without also protesting the building of other places of worship is discriminatory. In the UK, under building law, anyone can buy land and submit planning permissions to build a place of worship, and Muslims are not discriminated against in this regard. 
The writer believes it's acceptable for countries with a long history of a specific ethnic group to severely restrict immigration to preserve their nation's identity. 
The argument that Germany's post-WWII debt restructuring should be compared to Greece's current debt situation is considered empty because it fails to acknowledge the differences between war debts and free debts. 
Rand Paul's proposed "flat tax" is the most effective way to create a fair and effective tax system, as it ensures everyone has the same tax rate. A flat tax rate of 14.5% would incentivize Americans to work harder and pursue higher-paying jobs, while standardized deductions would help poor families and individuals survive. Additionally, a flat corporate tax rate would reduce the incentive for corporations to relocate outside of the US, and taxing imported products would encourage the employment of blue-collar workers in America.
Using illicit drugs like cocaine, heroin, and LSD should not be illegal as individuals should have the right to do whatever they want with their own bodies, even if it means self-inflicted harm.
Patriotism is inherently bad for humans, leading to discrimination, economic and political difficulties, mistrust, hatred, and war between nations or ethnic groups. Patriotism prevents people from accepting others as equal partners and fosters prejudice and arrogance.
Voting for the "lesser of two evils" is more important than voting one's conscience. This is because framing every choice as a binary choice between good and evil is naive and potentially dangerous, and voting for a third-party candidate can inadvertently help elect a worse option. For example, liberals in Florida who voted for Ralph Nader in 2000 may have helped elect George W. Bush, and similarly, voting for Bernie Sanders could potentially put Donald Trump in office.
Taxation is theft and opposes government programs like Obamacare and social security because they are coercive. Individuals own their bodies and labor, and therefore have the right to work for any employer at any price, which is why they think the minimum wage should be abolished. Government's only role should be to provide a court system and a small military, funded by excise taxes.
Americans should not be proud of their country's history, as every event they glorify has a dark background or is misinterpreted. For example, the American Revolution, Industrial Revolution, Civil War, and World War 2. With current issues like mass shootings, racial tensions, and a poor education system, there is no reason to celebrate or be proud of America.
The writer believes it's irresponsible for the LGBT community to create and share videos about being bullied, as it asks others to solve their problems for them, rather than taking action themselves.
There is no significant difference between ISIS destroying ancient artifacts and some Americans advocating for the banning of the Confederate flag, as both actions are driven by a desire to erase symbols of ideologies deemed objectionable. News outlets condemn ISIS' actions as an attempt to "wipe out history" while supporting the banning of the Confederate flag as a symbol of racism. 
The US government owes reparations to descendants of slaves, as the wealth generated by slaves still exists in the economy and some of it went to the federal government through taxes or direct production. Slaves built significant government buildings, including the Capitol Building and the Treasury, and their labor can be considered as "back pay" owed to their heirs. 
The Roman Catholic Church is institutionally guilty of evading justice by shielding rapists from trial worldwide, allowing further child abuse. Practicing Catholics who are aware of this conspiracy are morally culpable for continuing to support the church, as they have alternative options such as joining the Anglican or Episcopal churches or creating a new Catholic church without the corrupt bureaucracy. By donating 10% of their income to the church, practicing Catholics are monetarily supporting a criminal organization.
The US should leave NATO as it no longer provides benefits to the country, but instead acts as a funnel of money and resources to Europe with the US funding the majority of NATO's military and organizational costs. European countries are capable of affording their own defenses but rely on the US, forcing America to maintain high military spending and bases in Europe. If the US were to leave NATO, European countries would increase their own military funding, and the US would be able to eliminate costly bases and focus on improving relations with countries in Asia.
The Supreme Court should be an undemocratic branch of the government, composed of technocratic experts who can accurately apply constitutional law without being swayed by public opinion or regional differences. According to Chief Justice John Marshall, the Court's duty is to "say what the law is" and settle constitutional questions, rather than making policy decisions. 
There is no practical reason for an individual to vote in national elections, as their vote is unlikely to make a difference in the outcome. The author acknowledges that there may be other reasons to vote, such as social pressure or civic pride, but from a purely self-interested perspective, there is no reason to vote. 
People's views on big issues like climate change, gun rights, and public healthcare policy are rarely changed by new evidence, and instead, are often driven by emotional reasons and ideologies. When people do shift on these issues, it's often due to a change in societal norms or a personal experience that challenges their existing views. 
A computer would make an ideal libertarian president as it would be able to implement libertarian ideology in a context-free and emotionless manner, adhering strictly to the ideology's axioms. Unlike human politicians, a computer would not be swayed by emotions or tempted to diverge from libertarian principles, even in times of emergency. 
The claim that gun rights are derived from nature is unsubstantiated and lacks logical derivation. 
The minimum wage is hurting the economy and people, and should be abolished. It causes unemployment among low-qualified and minority individuals, forces some employers to do charity, and is a poorly targeted social policy that only moves money from one pocket to another.
Property rental agreements, especially for living spaces, should include a transfer of 0.4% ownership of the property each month. This means that after 20 years of rent, the renter would own almost 100% of the property, similar to a mortgage.
The number of seats a state has in the House of Representatives should be determined by the number of eligible voters, not the total population. This is because politicians only care about those who can vote, as evidenced by their lack of concern for prisons, orphans, and those under 18.
A person with a minority background can be racist if they hold prejudiced views and act on them, regardless of the target group. The definition of racist behavior should be based solely on whether someone is treating others worse because of their race or ethnicity, without considering power dynamics or historical oppression. 
The US should not provide military equipment and billions of dollars in aid to Egypt, as the country is deeply in debt and cannot afford it. Egypt's government was overthrown by the military, which is now imprisoning and executing opponents, including journalists who were reporting on a political party that was outlawed after being elected. Providing aid to Egypt contradicts America's values of freedom and democracy.
The US and other Western nations should support Assad as the "lesser of two evils" in Syria, as the alternative is the rise of ISIS and other Islamist groups. The situation in Syria is dire, with a civil war ongoing for years, massive destruction, civilian deaths, and refugees, and ISIS controlling much of the territory and oil.
