a1zuvg,"israel is held to an impossibly high standard we hold israel to a higher standard than anyone else . if you think about it , they 're doing precisely the same thing the british did in bengal , australia , and just about every other place they ended up . lest you think they are unique , the belgians did the same thing in the congo , the netherlands did the same in indonesia and the spanish did in latin america . the difference is that now we hear from the victims in ( close to ) real time , and back then we 'd hear about it a few months on , if at all . i think israel , having been founded in 1948 , by european intellectuals and lead by their descendents is held to a higher standard than other countries and it fails to meet those higher standards . kindly , change my view ... many thanks !","i thought we agreed that what british did in bengal , australia and just about any other place or what belgium did in congo or netherlands did in indonesia or spain did in latin america were all bad and should n't have been done . it 's only fair that now we are holding people to such high standards that these kinds of things wo n't ever happen again . to avoid confusion , what precisely is it that you think the british , the belgians , the dutch , and the spanish did that israel is now doing ? so the impossibly high standard to which you 're referring is ' not being a brutal regime ' like the british were . is n't it easier just to say that we should have held britain to a higher standard in the past ? ' do n't commit atrocities ' is not a very high standard . maybe we should have had those standards before belgians went apeshit in congo . i think there 's a chronology issue there , since most of the countries you mention were forced to give up their colonies in the 1960s . if there was a hold out who had still kept hold of its empire i imagine they would be treated much as israel are . actually i do agree that israel is held to a bit of a higher standard in that we do n't hear the same level of condemnation as for , for example , moroccan occupation of the western sahara or uk/us occupation of diego garcia . it 's not that israel is unique , many other countries have committed attrocities as you note . israel was founded in 1948 but has occupied territories that were not granted it . the standard lsrael is being held to is to not occupy or oppress anyone ."
a1yx0s,"the imf enables fiscal irresponsibility here 's my reasoning : the imf is a lender of last resort for governments to whom the market does not want to lend anymore . this last fact means that no rational financial agent considers this particular government would be able to safely sustain any further debt . in being a lender of last resort , the imf opens up the possibility of going into a level of debt considered unsafe , and in the way taking over the nation 's sovereignty in the form of its economic policy . if the imf did not run as a lender of last resort governments would be more responsible , in knowing it would be harder to get out of the hole in case its debt gets into a death spiral . will read all replies and come back in about an hour .","if the imf does n't exist , and they have to get the money , then the lender has more or less infinite power in this situation to define the terms . with the imf then there is always a last resort , that comes with significant problem and policy changes but there is a last resort . for the country getting money from the imf it 's still bad , so bad that no one if given the choice would choose to deal with them if they could avoid it . so it does n't really cause fiscal irresponsibility it just limit the damage that can come from it , sort of like why we have car insurance . we require car insurance , and it does n't seem to make people drive irresponsibility , it 's required so if you cause an accident you have money to correct the damages of the people you wronged . the imf steps in when the choice is imf or death spiral . actually the imf usually steps in a bit after that , once the death spiral has already begun . as for "" opens up the possibility of going into a level of debt considered unsafe "" i have to laugh . all governments throughout history have borrowed in an unsafe way , and will always do so . the problem is structural , a government can not ever go bankrupt or cease to be save through force-of-arms and an institution that can never stop existing is never not going to borrow unsafely . if anything the imf era has been the era of greater fiscal prudence . i actually agree with you that the imf enables fiscal irresponsibility , but not by existing . the imf 's problem is an ideological commitment to tried tested and failed mechanisms for getting out of death spirals , which force bad policies on governments and so make the situation worse . rules to contain lavish government deficits are most effective if countries design them to be simple , flexible , and enforceable in the face of changing economic circumstances . in new analysis , we look at fiscal rules in over 90 countries and , based on their experiences , find that the rules put in the place over the last three decades often were too complex , overly rigid , and difficult to enforce . governments having to run to the imf typically have already failed . i can take a bigger risk because i know that someone else will have to deal with the consequences if i fail . the problem with your argument is that if i 'm a corrupt politician , i can take risks and force the citizens of my country to deal with the consequences . i 'm going to do what i want regardless of what the imf does afterwards . look at the governments that put themselves this far in debt . does that seem like rational policy to you ? if they had properly managed their money , such that no imf intervention was needed , their countries would be in far better shape ."
a1txb5,"it would n't be unconstitutional for a state to enslave people 13th amendment : \ neither slavery nor involuntary servitude , except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted , shall exist within the united states , or any place subject to their jurisdiction . \ & #x200b ; this does n't mention any particular state 's laws . so a state could just pass a law making it a crime to walk on the left side of the sidewalk , imprison people for that , and force them into slave labor it does n't mention any particular length of time , so again a state could imprison/enslave people for pretty much any reason the supreme court has n't made any rulings about what can and can not be considered a ' crime ' . they 've ruled on the draft , and some person in alabama under employment that got imprisoned , but they 've never defined which crimes are acceptable to force a person into labor or not .","law school grad here : even though the 13th amendment is silent on the issue , and even though states are left to create their own criminal laws , there are too many ways that an extreme punishment - such as you jaywalking analogy - would be deemed unconstitutional . the 8th amendment would be what someone would challenge the state under by default , but here is a couple of ways i thought of : - the federal government has the ability to regulate interstate commerce and intrastate commerce ( if it affects interstate commerce ) . this has been expanded through supreme court precedent to essentially extend to anything reasonably relating to or affecting interstate commerce . in your hypo , mandatory life sentences for jaywalking would likely discourage interstate travelers due to fear of incarceration . this would have an effect on interstate travel , thus having an effect on the commerce within this state ( and possibly neighboring states ) . therefore it would be reasonably within congress ’s power to regulate . - another possibility is through federal funding of highways - interstate commerce again . congress could threaten to take away funding for highways ( which almost every state i believe elects to receive ) if they do not change their jaywalking punishment . although the state does n’t have to take the funds - yet they ’ve been taking them probably since the bill was enacted - it would put financial pressure on them to comply and change the sentencing guidelines . there are numerous creative legal ways to put a stop to a state essentially enslaving their people through “ legitimate ” 10th amendment authority . for instance , a state ca n't say wearing maga hat is illegal as that would be an infringement on the first amendment . simply because slavery is worded into the 13th amendment does not mean it is actively being done for the sole purpose of slavery alone , not yet at least . slavery would likely be considered cruel , and long term imprisonment for crimes like walking down the left side of the street would be considered unusual . anyone sentenced to a lifetime of slavery for jaywalking would certainly appeal , and the court 's should overturn ( or at the very least severely reduce ) the sentence . lawyer here , read this article while you ’re not entirely wrong that harmelin v michigan overturned the disproportionate sentencing of the 8th amendment . so while it is True that the state could de facto enslave people who commit crimes , i believe your example of essentially turning jay walking into a life sentence would fall under the “ extreme cases ” still allowed for disproportionate sentencing of the 8th amendment ."
a1nsul,"congressional staffers should receive significant pay bumps to limit the influence of lobbyists and corporate money currently , the office make up and salaries of an office of congressional staff in the house of representatives are as follows : 33k staff assistant ( essentially a secretary ) ; 36k legislative correspondent ( responds to constituents letters ) ; 50-60k ( 3-4 in an office ) legislative assistant ( responsible for reading and understanding policy , briefing the member on policy , meeting with interest groups and lobbyists ) ; 80-100k legislative directors ( the manager of legislative assistants , has important policy issues ) ; 120k chief of staff ( leader of the office and congresspersons confidant/strategist ) . the senate gets a 10-20k pay bump usually on these salaries and have a few more saff , and the same can be said about committee staff . due to the cost of living in dc , these salaries are relatively low . for people who are la 's and above , they are very low for the intelligence and skill-sets that they have . normally , after 3 years on capitol hill , la 's and above move to the private sector , whether lobbying or doing some other type of business . these decisions are almost always made due to financial constraints , simply put , they are getting paid 2-5x under market value . the result of this on congress is a massive brain drain . staff turnover leads to the lobbyists and not the actual congressional staffers having the subject matter expertise and confidence in these areas . this leads to an increased influence of these lobbyists over the much younger and inexperienced congressional staffers . to make matters even worse , when major pieces of legislation , these lobbyists that are getting paid 500k a year leave their position lobbying and return to capitol hill to literally write the pieces of legislation . after the legislation is written , they then leave the hill and go back lobbying for a pay bump . this type of influence over legislation is how corporations and lobbyists wind up literally writing pieces of legislation and is actually more effective than companies just donating large sums of cash ( although the donations and lobbyist support on legislation is a two pronged approach ) . to prevent the brain drain and mitigate the influence of outside entities on the creation of legislation , i propose increasing the lower level staff assistant and legislative correspondent positions by 1.5 x , the legsilative assistnant , legislative director and chief of staff positions by 4x . this would also require that the salaries of members of congress would have to be bumped from 174,000 to roughly 500k ( assuming that this is the salary cap for everyone ) . at the very least , this would prevent staffers who truly love their jobs and serving the country from leaving due to family concerns or feeling undervalued based on their market value being much higher in other disciplines than politics . ie , staff who loved their jobs would be less likely to switch into sales/finance purely for cash . this would also increase the cost of lobbying for companies significantly , because to poach staffers they would have to significantly raise the amount of money they pay them . all in all , i am struggling to see the downside to an approach like this , and only see benefits . article on congressional brain drain :[ -- url -- )","we do n't seem to have the same problem of turnover with our congressional representatives than we have with their staff . are something related to net neutrality which is still hard to understand . apple ? all of those companies have lobbyist which try to inform you about issues that affect their employees . or a corrupt leader finds a way to take a form of bride . this helps reduce the effectiveness of the revolving door while increasing the effectiveness of other forms of lobbying ( helping write legislation , helping organize coalitions , advertising , etc ) . after all , now there 's a much larger incentive to do anything possible to keep office due to the salary being so much higher than what they 'd make out of office . all comments that earned deltas ( from op or other users ) are listed [ here ] ( / r/deltalog/comments / a1og6y/deltas"
a1n0eb,"employers should not be allowed to fire employees over their political views or humorous statements made outside of work . i recently saw a case on twitter where a man tweeted a transphobic joke where he posted a screenshot of a news article that said the trump administration was opposing trans rights and another screenshot of a maga hat order page on the trump website . an lgbt activist and journalist then found out where he worked and forwarded it to his employer , causing him to get fired . you may find the joke distasteful and offensive , i can see why , but i think it was wrong that he was fired . he was clearly joking and did not post it on a work related account , yet he still lost his job . even if he was against trans rights , this still would n't be ok . as a socialist , i believe that workers have a right to a separate personal life to their professional life and that no non-criminal activity done while not on the clock and unrelated to their job should be a firing or even punishable offense . one of the main reasons for this is that i believe allowing employers to fire employees for what they say or believe out of the workplace gives employers , who tend to be richer , too much power over public discourse and society in general . it does n't matter if you 're an anarcho-communist or an ethnic nationalist , you should be able to voice your opinion without fear of being made unemployed . what many on the left fail to realise is that if employers can fire people who say unpleasant things , they can also fire those who speak out in favour of economic equality and workers rights . i know many who disagree will be thinking "" but its a private conpany "" or something to that effect . the problem with this is that it does n't take into account the consequences of letting the rich effectively control their workers entire public lives . you may think it 's good in principle , but the consequences in practice are terrible . you may also be thinking "" but i do n't want to work with a neo-nazi . "" this is understandable , most people including me do n't , but the alternative sets a bad precedent . if an employer can fire a neo-nazi or any other bigot for their views , they can do the same to a socialist , liberal , conservative for theirs . i 'd rather work with a neo-nazi than be coerced into silence lest i be unemployed . as long as you keeps your views to yourself in the workplace , there is no grounds for firing you . if you do n't like working with someone with a political stance you dislike , even if you dislike it for a good reason , you just have to deal with it , you are free to stay away from them outside of work .","no employer in their right mind would want to have nazis working for them , and should not be forced . if my favorite restaurant was revealed to be employing a vile neo-nazi and refuses to fire him , i sure as hell am not giving them any of my business and so will many others . in the jim crow era , a white business in the deep south would risk severe backlash if it were seen to be nice to black customers ( hell , if it were seen to be serving blacks at all ) . if you want real progress , it 's up to the federal government to legislate it ( civil rights act ) . ideally , people should be able to recognize that an employee does n't represent the whole company ; but that has never been the case and is very likely to be the case . here 's a real life example of what would transpire if employers could not fire people for their political views . needless , to say the school received tremendous amounts of backlash and threats for the student 's actions . many people wanted the student expelled , but valdosta university was powerless to do so because you can not fire a student for his political views or for peacefully protesting . valdosta university received lost substantial amounts of funding due to a 20 \ ~ 30 % drop in enrollment . so if laws were to be changed to prevent employers for firing their employees for their beliefs ( or expressing them ) , why do you feel like people would be substantially more understanding if people are already willing to blame a whole school for the actions of a single student ? i agree that employers should n't be able to fire employees for the most part , except when these views hurt the business . imagine in a liberal stronghold like california or portland that an employee was extremely vocal about being against gay rights . or an employee in a conservative stronghold was extremely vocal about banning the bible . if you were an employer , would n't you want to to associate yourself with people who make a positive impact on you image ? it is now permanently on display and would affect me and my company , and as an employer i should be able to choose what message i want to send to the public . in the same way that employers can dictate what you wear to work because you represent the company , they can dictate whether they want your behavior to represent their company . joking or not , somebody took offense to the statement , and if the company does n’t take action , they risk a reputation of being a transphobic because of a comment you made . in the us , generally an employer can not fire you for discussing salary , work conditions or collective bargaining . ca , co , nd and ny already have laws that say you ca n’t be fired for anything legal you do outside work . what if the joke ridiculed the personal circumstances of his boss as well as those of every person on his team and everyone in his department and in fact the company as a whole ? furthermore , what if his joke made light of the suffering experienced by everyone in a certain racial group , e.g. "" those nirs had it good -- us whites saved them from a life of savagery in africa , ha ha ha "" ? clearly , firing my waiter and hiring a new one is a sound business strategy . it has nothing to do with politics , it simply means that i am making a move to increase the profitability of my business . there are already countries that have anti-discrimination laws which apply to hiring and firing practices of companies . that being said , if you go to most chinese restaurants here , the vast majority of the staff will be asian . i personally do n't really have an issue with this but there is really no explanation for this other than discriminatory hiring practices against other races . somebody born and raised in canada to asian parents is n't going to a better worker at a chinese restaurant because of their race . but for most of the workers there , being asian is n't a legitimate benefit to how you perform your job . and it is simply statistically improbable for a minority group to represent the majority of workers at a company where anybody can apply if there are no discriminatory hiring practices . most people are like myself and do n't particularly care , and the restaurants are likely not coming out and clearly saying "" we are n't going to hire you because you 're black/white "" . now with something like race it can more easy to spot , but with political opinion like what you 're suggesting it 's impossible . so the problem with your suggestion is that while it 's coming from a good place , it 's not a hard wall for companies to stop doing what you want to stop . so long as you can not discriminate with hiring and firing practices based on political ideology , then no smart company will ever list political ideology as the reason for not hiring somebody or firing them . think about it , if your suggestion was law , when google fired that tech guy for his men vs women in the workplace report , they would n't have listen that report as a reason but instead used some benign one and it never would have gotten media attention . if you want to actually solve this issue or even address it , then people need to be aware it exists . and if allowing it raises awareness of it 's existence , then that is what should be done until a solution that will definitively stop it can be put in place . op you should remove the neo nazi part , because people are going to argue specifically against it and threatening to kill people is n't protected under freedom of speech also , on the flip side , if i 'm an employer of a small business and i work closely with my employees , why do i have to continue to employ someone who 's views i find distasteful , especially if i think they will contribute to a toxic work environment ? should i have to continue to employ the neo-nazi while the rest of my workers quit and i have difficulty finding replacements who want to work at a company that employs neo-nazis ? you may discover the joke tacky and hostile , i can perceive any reason why , yet i think it was n't right that he was terminated . he was unmistakably kidding and did not post it on a business related record , yet despite everything he lost his employment . regardless of whether he was against trans rights , this still would n't be alright . as a communist , i trust that laborers have a privilege to a different individual life to their expert life and that no non-criminal action done while not on the clock and random to their activity ought to be a terminating or even culpable offense ."
a1mixl,"legislative bodies should be required to explain , in formal writing , why they voted a certain way when it comes to legislation . i think publicly elected officials responsible for driving policy and legislation should be required to explain why they vote certain ways in writing . voting along party lines is reprehensible regardless of the side . politics should n't be a game about which side wins , but rather which fact-based opinions win regardless of sides . if the legislative bodies have no reasonable explanation for why they voted a certain way besides voting along party lines , they should not be allowed to vote because we have no reason to believe that they 're not voting out of self-interest . if , for example , someone in congress voted against what seems to be reasonable gun law without explanation , but you can see in their financial disclosure that the nra contributes a lot of money and support for them , how are we to know that their vote was not influenced by the nra without them explicitly citing so and explaining what other reason compelled them not to vote for said reasonable legislation ? i 'm not even asking for a long written response from them . a short paragraph or page summary with sources they 're using to base their vote on is good enough .","why do us house reps serve only 2 years ? they have to spend half of their time campaigning and securing campaign funds . their terms should be 6 years , an the senate should be 10 years . this way , when each term is over , the electorate has sufficient time to determine whether or not they like the performance of the incumbent and the representatives can afford to spend less relative time fundraising and campaigning and more time reading about the issues . congress , on the other hand , needs to be less political and more productive . do those all need explanations ? they only have two years right now and i do n't want them spending less time legislating . i truly do sympathize with op ’s frustration and do understand that politicians often make boneheaded decisions or vote along party lines . committees : they do the heavy lifting in terms of analysis and policy justification . essentially committee transcripts will help indicate how the party feels about legislation . however , it at least helps show the party block ’s justifications . the legislator could pass a law which says every bill must contain a 1 page statement . say i have a 500 page bill in front of me and i have an nra-1 page fact sheet about the bill . on the effective side of the discussion - a politician is successful in their career by convincing the people they should be voted for and convincing people and companies to donate to them to fund those election efforts . if a voting record serves those goals then the politicians will vote in such a way . asking politicians to account for thier voting actions is like asking a lawyer to find enough loophole laws to allow you to do a thing . you will get a legal reason that has everything to do with good government and nothing to do with elections and money . so the effective answer is they do in the congressional record already ... and it is legally legitimate reasons that speak nothing to the type of answers you are looking for . debates prior to taking a vote is politicians opportunity to voice their opinion . congress is already slow ; if you have to force 635 people to submit and keep track of written records analyzing an entire bill ( many of which are as thick as books ) , they will take even longer and further lower their productivity . this could be better addressed if various parts of the mccain-feingold act were reinstated or made even more strict . both arguments are reasonable , and a hypothetical lawmaker can choose which ever argument he wants to formally write up , based on who paid him . simply forcing a lawmaker to reveal one reason for their vote does n't make it the real reason , nor does it preclude lobbiers from being the real reason . flat earth politicians will vote for those policies based on dubious sources , but how could it be legally shown to be dubious ? so all such a summary would really do is tell you that the politician is good at spin , twisting the facts , and not that he has a rational reason for voting for or against a law . it would n’t change much as each voting bloc already has a reason pre-written with appropriate marketing , explanation , and reasoning . - my corporate sponsors wrote the legislation for me to present and i need to stay on message . - if i do n’t take this post-congressional position for $ 200k with stock options and insider trading , someone else will . - because i ’m voting the right way for this issue i do n’t care about , my party promises to back me on my pet project that i do care about . the 109th tennessee general assembly adjourned on april 22nd , 2016 to become a part of tennessee history with passage of major legislation to reduce crime , cut tax burdens , spur job growth , accelerate the state ’s success in k-12 education , boost the number of college graduates , curb drug abuse and curtail drunk driving . state lawmakers also passed significant legislation to ease traffic congestion , reduce child abuse , aid farmers , increase access to healthcare and medication , increase voter participation and provide a safer environment for the elderly . gun ownership is protected under the second amendment and when someone presumes to create caveats to the right , then they need to justify it legally . if a representative in an area where the nra has a lot of influence votes on a bill that limits gun ownership at all , they 're going to have a hard time getting re-elected . the nra is one example , but a representative from a coal or oil producing area votes for strong climate change laws , they 're threatening the jobs of the people who vote for them . seems to me this is a good thought , but in reality the things they wrote would just be a lot of bullshit . legislators will encourage supporters of a bill to testify on the record so that the letter and spirit of the law can be honored . i suspect you 'd see a lot of answers like , "" while there are good arguments on both sides of this issue , i think this law would result in more harm than good . "" what i would prefer is a list of who authors the actual legislation , down to the page . justin amash , representative for michigan 's third district , posts his rationale behind every single vote on his facebook page the next day . he feels he owes it to his constituents to justify his voting record , which i agree that he does . other commenters have mentioned that heaps of records exist to clarify your congressman 's vote , but you can always call or write them and ask . no additional explanation should be mandated , but kudos to amash ( regardless of his political stances ) for being honest to his constituents . for instance , with the nra example someone would simply say "" there are already a large amount of restrictions and regulations around purchasing a firearm "" ( which is True ) , and "" and this law x would make it even more difficult to obtain a firearm than it already is today , therefore infringing on our second amendment "" . so in other words , despite the fact you 're trying to get someone to admit to voting party lines or that they 're in cahoots with the nra , you 're still not going to get that with this proposal . every answer would be essentially the same : "" after intensive scrutiny of all available information and without regard to special-interest groups and the lobbying efforts of interested parties , i have determined that , for the common good and consistent with principles of good governance , that this legislation should/should not be passed . "" you seem to be under a misapprehension about what democratic republics are for : the job of a legislator is to represent their constituents . the only valid reason for a legislator to vote on a bill either way is "" because i think that 's what the people that voted for me would want "" . and the only people qualified to decide whether they are doing this properly are the aforementioned constituents , who will voice their opinion at the next elections . nice thought , but this wo n’t work the way you want it to . politicians will just write the talking point argument distributed by their party . no politician will write the actual reason they voted , which is what you want . “ i voted against gun control because the nra gives me money . ” there are tons of legislative history , debate record , that are archived for every bill . debate records about second amendment , statements about freedom to own guns , etc etc . anyone in a prominent political position is capable of defending any sort of position in a reasonable-sounding manner without citing their financial supporters . i do n't need my state legislators ( or their interns ) to tell me about their thoughts on what should be the state 's flower . in practice , there are already explanations presented for each side 's view ( s ) on each bill , and anyone who cares can find them easily . requiring a paragraph to be written or a form to be filled out wo n't make people suddenly care more about politicians ' explanations or practically changed how politicians ' votes are viewed . each party would employ a team of writers to create boiler-plate phrases which the legislator could quickly build a reason from , or have a reason automatically created programmatically . such a system would not improve public understanding of why they voted a particular way , and would instead tend to obfuscate the reasons given by legislators that would have communicated without the law . they would just ask the nra for the reason they need to give . any lobby group would then have this as part of the cost of buying a vote . you seem to be focusing on the nra , which gives me an objective point to pick on . the nra is an interest groups of citizens , with very little industry money injected , who are pretty low on the overall congressional donor list , compare that to whichever other industry you like . i get where you 're coming from , and i agree with you . but , this is how it would go in reality : anyone who voted for something even slightly controversial that would be difficult to explain , would just put a group of political interns and law students into a room , and not let them out , until they came up with a plausible , pc stock response for the politician to read off a teleprompter . public officials already make these kinds of statements on most major votes via press announcements that no one ever notices . for your gun control example , legislators would just take a response handed to them by the nra about why x bill was good/bad for their voters . it 's not like members would say "" oh you got me , i only voted for this because i like nra money "" . requiring officials to put out a cited response on why they 're supporting renaming a post office in rutabaga , rhode island is n't worth anyone 's time and effort . since they already make press announcements about their votes on major bills this suggestion really only impacts the minor acts that no one would look up anyway . what you 're asking for is that legislators be qualified for their positions , and that they publicly explain what they are doing and why to the populous . currently the only qualification any legislator has is the ability to be elected and re-elected . everything else they do is in service to that single aspect because if they can not maintain their positions then they can not continue to do anything in said position . lets say politician a gets money from interest groups that very much want proposition z to pass . what stops him from voting for it and then making up bullshit about why he voted for it , when the real reason is money ? the legislative body could have voted a certain way for any arbitrary reason , and we ca n't really know their True intent . for example , imagine a scenario where a giant asteroid is heading toward earth that will certainly kill all of humanity , and yet many members of your party refuse to vote for the bill that has been scientifically proven to divert it unless they also get some preposterous and absurd-on-the-face-of-it bills for their states ( pork , etc. ) . do you stick to your principles and vote against the absurd bills even though you know it means the certain destruction of all humankind , or do you swallow your pride and vote for those disgusting bills because you know it to be the lesser of two evils ? sure , not every mep will vote on every issue , but we 're still looking at something like 100,000 paragraphs or page summaries with sources . instead we have a system whereby if you want to question an individual representative 's vote on a matter , you do it directly with them . and if they do n't give you sufficient answer you vote against them in the next election ( or even campaign against them ) . of course , even if that did happen , what makes you think that the representative would be entirely open in their response ? say they were influenced by the nra to vote some way - the nra will have provided talking points somewhere , and all the representative needs to do is repeat them ( ideally rephrased ) , without disclosing where they came from . you used the nra as an example , they would just write out a short explanation for legislators who voted in favor to use , and they would just change up the wording a little so they did n't all have the exact same answer . articulating a reason for why they voted a certain way is easy . unless you have someone who decides what reasons are good enough to justify voting for or against a particular legislation , nothing changes . you really do not know how much the government publishes for the general public . please do be polite when doing this a poor intern in usually managing the phone and they will read you the statement on the issue . you may disagree with their positions or whatever , but they are elected to vote with their party . that 's why whoever wins the republican ( or dem ) primaries in states ( aka new england for dems and the south for republicans etc ) with respective cult following of political parties , theyre winning the election too . such a requirement would change nothing because it ’s always possible to provide a plausible justification even if you really just voted because of campaign contributions . there ’s a whole industry of lobbyists dedicated to coming up with sophisticated justifications for legislation . some votes will always come down to principles that ca n’t be argued one way or the other on facts . voting along party lines most of the time makes sense because your party is likely to be more in line with the principles you have . i ’m not going to read all the comments , but this would simply lead to an nfl-style , cliche-driven press conference where all answers are canned and spun wonderfully to appeal to the voters . if i recall correctly , this is how the british house of lords operates . they ca n't deny bills outright , but they can send them back to the house of commons for amending , and they need a stated reason to do so . i 'd support an exception for things like abstinence though , because it could be for a simple reason . again , i get that you 're almost certainly a democrat and that means you almost certainly do n't believe they should have the right to own firearms but i 'm not sure why those you disagree with should n't be allowed to express or advocate for their opinions . your argument is that it should be used to justify why they are voting personally , so as to show they are n't just voting with the party . from a practical point of view a written justification is n't fit for purpose . no doubt the party will have a justification of sorts , if they were voting against their own view point but along with the party , they would just reword the party opinion on the matter and submit that . in the us the democrats would have thier aides go-to whatever left leaning think tanks and have them source stuff and write it up , and the republicans would go-to thier right leaning think tanks and get sources as well . then we just devolve into arguing about what they wrote rather than what they are saying , until the legislature actually changes all this would do is kick the can down the road and make public responses slower . also let 's be frank , the answer on both sides is they voted because of money or ideology and it 's really not difficult to see that and requiring thier aides to come up with sources wo n't change that . in the case of the gun control example you cite , it would be easy for a politician to cite a pro-gun belief , regardless of if his belief is genuine . one can assemble a paragraph in support of any position on any topic . i once visited my state legislature and it was an assembly line for laws . if the legislators had to write essays justifying their votes , they would n't possibly have time for it all . but that 's an easy problem to solve . they 'd just have the lobbyists write the essays for them . it will not change anything as the stated reasons are not necessarily the reasons why they voted that way . are you saying that each legislator should always publicly post their reasoning for every single bill , or that when called upon , should be able to explain their vote ? every time that i 've been concerned about my legislators , on the local , state , and federal level , doing something that i felt was questionable , i 've felt comfortable writing an email to them expressing my views and asking for their opinions . afterwards , i would typically respond , expressing my understanding or continued dissatisfaction of their position . perhaps the reason why they should n't need to be explaining how they voted in every single vote is purely in the numbers of how many obscure things they have to vote on . perhaps that would make sense for major legislation , but then you run into the question of what counts as major or not . i think a better way would be to expect legislators to respond promptly to your request for their explanation , and vote against them if they do not . anyone could put any reason for voting a certain way and omit the real reason ."
a1lvhu,"nazis will not come to power again within any of our lifetimes i do n’t claim to be a fortune-teller so i wo n’t go any farther than our lifetimes , but i just do n’t think it ’s likely at all that nazis will gain a large amount of political power in america anytime within the next hundred years or so . the main reason i believe this is because there are so , so few nazis in the world that they have nearly no chance of ever winning a democratic election . a few months ago there was a unite the right 2.0 rally and if i ’m not mistaken , twelve nazis showed up . that ’s not an exaggeration , it was literally just twelve dudes . even at the first unite the right rally there were only a couple hundred of them . and i know that for each nazi who showed up , there were plenty who did n’t . but even if we were to assume that 10,000 nazis stayed home for every nazi who showed up , that ’s still a tiny amount of people . it would be 120,000 people , which is less than one tenth of one percent of the american population . i hear people talking all the time about how we need to prevent nazis from ever seizing power again . when i hear this , it ’s like someone telling me that we need to watch out for meteorites . like , i suppose it ’s True but the chances of it actually being an issue are laughably small . overall , i do n’t think it ’s likely at all that nazis will ever come to power and take over america in the next hundred years . cmv","so while your argument is validate that they do n't have wide spread support they did n't need it to take political power the last time . many people , who do n't self identify as nazi are called nazis by others . i agree that i wo n't be ruled by nazis in my lifetime . i 'll just leave these videos here , which i think to a good job of illustrating the point ( and i do n't want to write it up ) . ( 2 ) the republican party is assisted by a 24/7 propaganda media apparatus in fox news . and that culture has endured , as actual personalities on the network have confirmed that the purpose of the network was not to inform people but to "" stir up the crazies "" ( two sources , both writing about the same documentary ) . studies have shown that when fox news enters a market , the republican party gains votes and that watching more fox news makes people more likely to vote republican . in fact , the people who watched only fox news did worse on the quiz than people who did n't watch any news at all ! page 12 of this report shows that that kind of blatantly False coverage has a real effect on people 's assessment of the importance of climate change . even countries that are still full democracies are seeing a massive surge in support for far-right parties ( far-right is basically "" nazi-lite "" ) . ten years ago i would have said there 's no chance nazis take power in america . nazis taking power is not like you personally getting hit in the head by a small meteorite . the last time the nazis took power , we had to fight a world war to stop them . even if we can only find 12 nazis in total , we should throw those 12 nazis in jail and never ever let them speak to anyone . most regime changes are not widely predicted an entire lifetime or century in advance . presumably , you 're not a fan of nazis , you merely feel as though the risk right now is small . however , you do care enough about the risk to look at attendance numbers . the reason people are so adamant about snuffing out any nazi rally or making people aware of any rise of nazi/white supremacist/ethno state/fascist thinking , is n't because they fear a 4th reich , its because of the erosion of democracy/social progress/rights and freedoms that can come from them . he has alienated our closest democratic allies and endeared us to more fascist and totalitarian regimes . he has done with this the support of way more people than i thought ever would . now we got people like richard spencer trying to clean up the image of actual nazis by appearing where he can as a clean cut guy in a suit instead of a skinhead in boots . we got the country becoming more afraid and rejecting the progress we made and wanting to regress the country to and idealized state that never actually existed 50 + years ago because they think it will make the country great again by going backwards . so no , nazi 's may not come to power in our lifetime . they do n't want you to be complicit in it by doing nothing if you do see it . they want this country to be the land of opportunity for everyone that lives hear and may come to live hear . world war i ended in 1918 and hitler had basically finished consolidating power by 1933 so radical change in a short period of time is possible . i think you 're probably right that "" nazi 's "" will never gain significant power in the u.s. , but it 's possible that a group repackaging fascism with a new brand could gain significant power . while america is n't really anywhere near a fascist state at the present its not hard to imagine these particular principles gaining traction . and finally both major party platforms in the last presidential election were anti-trade . do n't overstate the influence of insane people on the finge , but also do n't get complacent in believing freedom and democracy are the natural state of mankind . the only way nazis could seize power in america is if the republican party will be divided into multiple small parties , and the nazis would try to win by coalition with the biggest successors to the republicans , add a good leader to the party and they can win the elections someone who wore nazi memorabilia openly and led an extreme right party came within a couple of percent of winning the presidency of austria . but the nazis were tiny too , until many crises struck germany and they started gaining traction ."
a1lb2x,"the way that us politics currently exist is ineffective and , to an extent , harmful . the fact that the united states has a two-party political system does n’t make any sense . it implies that all politics is a binary , which is hardly ever the case . if someone is very wealthy , they will be more inclined to vote republican because of the fiscal stance that republicans take . but , by voting republican , that person will also be siding with anti-abortion ideals , anti-lgbt + ideals , etc . if someone is very socially liberal , they will be more inclined to vote democratic , but they will also be siding with big government ideals . by an extension , these unnecessary labels we give ourselves drastically affect our social standing . many republicans refuse to socialize with democrats , and many democrats refuse to socialize with republicans , each side claiming that the other is ignorant or uneducated . by creating these labels , we have effectively ruined the original goal of america : to be a ‘ melting pot ’ of cultures where anyone can succeed and be happy . these labels have essentially distorted our views of others and made us less sociable and tolerant . unless we as a society collectively acknowledge this and are willing to change it , the state of the country will continue to decline until we hit rock bottom .","it 's not simply a matter of red team , blue team , but that people are tying their political beliefs very closely with their sense of identity . so when someone criticises their party , they feel it is a personal criticism of them . it 's easy to see why people tie their identity so close to their political beliefs as the two are related . tribalism is a problem , but the bigger problem is that the two parties are both reflecting a fairly narrow ideological worldview between them , neoliberalism with some diminishing keynesian protections ( democrats , neoliberalism with less of that ( gop ) . but i do n't worry as much about the impact on social situations . even if there were four or twelve or twenty political parties , i do n't think i would find a party i agree with on every issue . first , i have no clue what on earth you mean by "" big government ideals .

a1l5uu,"any sentencing above 45 years in prison is pointless and should automatically be turned to a death sentence after a set amount of time served because of how humans adapt and acclimate themselves to their environment . first and foremost , i extremely dislike our prison system as it stands because of it 's self perpetuating nature and believe we need hard prison reform . that being said , i strongly feel that long term sentencing is pretty pointless because you arent reforming life sentence criminals , you 're locking them in a room and hoping they feel punished for their actions . and i do think this works for a period of time , but once you stay in a crappy situation for a long time you just get desensitized to it . and to me , paying to keep someone alive through taxes , for long periods of time , after committing life sentence crimes , is really insulting and more of a punishment to the victims of these people . i dont think long term sentencing really does anything , if the point is to get them out of society for the rest of their lives then why not just make them serve 10-15 years and then proceed with execution . because after that amount of time people would just be used to it . any moral standpoint on the death penalty will not cmv . im more looking to discuss the psychological effects of long term sentencing and wether or not it is an effective punishment for heinous crimes , which i currently do not think it is . my view implies 0 % wronful convictions , and all crimes receiving appropriate sentencing length . im looking more to discuss the effectiveness of long term punishment vs short term with execution .","at first it might seem that we can solve this problem by improving our methods of determining guilt . there is currently about 17000 murders per year in the us for population . given that no investigation method is 100 percent reliable , you 're probably gon na end up executing an innocent eventually . life prison sentences are a compromise between wanting to punish a lot of people and killing an innocent . statistics have shown that we wrongly convict too many people and therefore we should never use the death penalty until we get this under control . some statistics pin things at 1/25 people on death row are actually innocent . therefore , i maintain that we need to continue to give people life sentences knowing that if they were wrongly convicted , they at least have time to work within the system and overturn that . the state murdering innocent people is about one of the most unacceptable acts i can possibly think of . so in other words , when we can make sure 100 % of our "" death penalty "" convictions are for actual guilty people , then i 'd consider your proposal . the death sentence actually costs taxpayers more money in the long wrong due to several factors . also , regardless of my personal feelings on the system being inefficient and perhaps even cruel , these are still lives and to kill someone and have it not be a cruel and unusual punishment you need more to it than being expensive for the state . if you give someone the death penalty , they are automatically granted a certain number of appeal attempts . on september 20th a man was released after being wrongfully imprisoned for 27 years ( article ) . i agree with you that it 's rather pointless to keep someone locked up for more than 10-15 years because they 'll get desensitized by it . however i do n't think the government should start executing people who are locked up for more than 15 years ."
a1l1v2,"the "" locking up in cages "" discussion about the us boarder does not properly consider what alternatives exist so when talking about how the us has been handling refugee claims , the go to response seems to follow a line of "" they are putting people into cages "" and i have seen several posts even claim it is essentially a concentration camp . while i agree that it would be nice if there could be better facilities and people in charge , there to me has to be a recognition of what should be expected to be possible . with all the claims that this should n't be happening , i have not really seen any concrete explanation of what should instead be done . from my thinking on the subject , i do not really see what else could really be done differently about where to put these people . first off , even from countries that have a government ( thinking europe countries ) that are a lot more friendly than the us in their approach to refugees , they still seem to have several issues in regard to providing resources and funds to help these people , so a simple suggestion of investing more money does n't really seem like a well thought out solution to me . next is the fact these people have to be kept somewhere until they can be processed through the system . the only real solutions to this problem i see are these 1 ) process them from outside the country 2 ) build better facilities 3 ) do not restrain them and i have issues with all of them . 1 ) is probably the one i personally have the list issues with , but i have the feeling that other people probably would not feel that way , it would mean that these people are not really getting help as fast as possible and are instead causing issues for the people in mexico . 2 ) i have issue as it returns to my above point about funds . it would cost a lot of money and time to build such facilities , where such money would likely be coming from tax payers to pay for a system they could never benefit from . us already has a pretty negative views on taxes in general and if you ca n't convince them to adopt universal health care , something they can use if needed , i do n't see how you can convince them to spend more on providing better shelter for a system you will never be a part of . i also do have somewhat of an issue that i feel that money spent on providing better shelter should probably be spent towards the homeless population as well , since they are currently citizens who do not have any shelter compared to refugees who are not yet citizens , who at least have a roof and food provided . 3 ) is just something that would just render a refugee program basically obsolete as once people get into the country , they could just go any where and avoid the system from then onward with no real way for them to be kept track of . this solution also means that these new refugees are basically providing for themselves in a country they have no footholds in and would to me seem to cause even more issues than the current system appears to have . overall , i just do n't really see a feasible solution to the problem people want solved , they just want things to be done better with seemingly no consideration into how that would actually be done . it just seems wrong to yell "" this needs to stop "" without understanding anything that could be done instead . the answer i 'm looking for is what exactly is this feasible solution that justifies the comments calling this stuff a concentration camp when i do n't see much else of a solution .","just as a regular joe i do n't have a solution myself but this seems to be a rather new problem , so the obvious solution is to go back to however it was handled before . this is especially True regarding the children being separated from their families , which we know to be caused by policy changes in the trump administration . the excuse by the administration is basically "" they are breaking the law so we have to put them in jail and take away their kids , "" but that ignores that we 've been handling it for years without this issue with the children . imo whatever goal is met by this crackdown on immigration is not worth stealing kids or locking up and beating people in old walmarts . there was no reason to detain people in the first place . under the current system you are arrested , detained , and then sent back . they ’re more humane , they cost $ 4.12 a day ( whereas housing an immigrant costs $ 320 a day ) , and the immigrants show up to court over 99 % of the time ."

a1h7hb,"the us prison system systematically violated human rights and is therefore morally unjustified originally prisons were seen as a strategy for transforming habits and ethics . nowadays not so much , the current prison system is more focused on retribution rather than rehabilitation . there is no pretense that rights are respected , there is no concern for the individual , there is no sense that men and women incarcerated in super maxes deserve anything approaching respect and comfort which i believe to be morally wrong . another concept is that one-time decision "" and "" death-in-custody sentence "" - violates the human dignity of the condemned , the high court 's decisions notwithstanding . a final and total condemnation of a person , lwop sentencing is problematic because there is no way of knowing if there is proportionality in the sentence , it does not allow for rehabilitation and does not account for changes in the offender 's danger to society over time . last point i have is that the widespread leniency with which offending officers are treated suggests that for women , prison is a space in which the threat of sexualized violence that looms in the larger society is effectively sanctioned as a routine aspect of the landscape of punishment behind prison walls . which suggest that inmates are not thought of as "" human beings "" but are thought of as objects .","mental disabilities as hindering as psychosis or depression can not always be rehabilitated . most likely , the would need some sort of assisted living situations to be able to live in society normally . if their mental illnesses have already put them into situations of being incarcerated , it would be very difficult to combat that as well as rehabilitate them properly . as such , out of prison , it would be better suited for some of these individuals to live in some sort of assisted living facility that caters towards their mental illnesses more so than prison could . when you ’re put in prison you ’re “ rights ” are stripped away completely you are no longer a person you ’re considered property of the state . but this means that you do accept focusing on retribution instead of rehabilitation . let 's say a murderer is n't caught for 30 years ( dna evidence ) , but in those 30 years he 's been a perfect citizen , never having committed any crime more serious than jaywalking . there 's no evidence that he would go on to commit future crimes , and many people come to court to speak about his character . prisons do absolutely violate rights , and that is because when a crime is committed the criminal forfeits many of their rights . [ -- url -- ) the wiki states that the original prisons and other legal punishments were used to help the victim get vengeance . there are justice systems in our world still like this , and are more cruel than the us prison system because they are only concerned with vengeance . our organization seeks to ensure that the provisions and resolutions of the universal declaration of human rights ( udhr ) , and the conventions and recommendations of the international labor organization ( ilo ) are into effect as a reference in terms of the insight and practice , taking into consideration the domestic laws of each country . go look at the rates that males are raped @ the rate underage males are raped by correction officers in juvenile prison . firstly , i can agree that the prison system can be cruel and strip citizens of their basic human rights . although given the culture we face today in america especially with rise in criminal action and the rate that prisoners are returning after being realized shows that lots of these prisoners do n’t have the qualities to be treated properly . i agree that in a perfect world prison would be a type of rehab to help you overcome the criminal mindset , but with all the large gangs and criminal activity prison has to go to these standerds not because they wan na be cruel but simply because it ’s the only way for them to control the large amounts of criminals , maybe a rehab type prison could be introduced to people who have committed certain crimes that were n’t see as physically dangerous people and were able to be interaction with non prisoners with out conflict . i think anything over 24 hours in solitary confinement violates human rights i think distribution of crack , crystal meth , heroin , or opiates are a fundamental danger and should do reasonable prison time . i think drug users have a health problem and should n't necessarily ever do prison time i 'm sure it would n't be hard to come up with arguments from philosophers arguing for this point in the abstract , but i 'm very suspicious that prisons ever actually made much of an effort to reform criminals . i disagree on the initial premise that prison should only be about rehabilitation ."
a1gvj4,"left wing supporters are effected by climate change propaganda kinda the same way right wing supporters are effected by war propaganda . i noticed there are many posts about climate change saying how dire the situation is . yet , im convinced that the majority of people talking about it have little to no actual knowledge in climate science and mostly rely on news articles without real understanding of the complexity behind the numbers and graphs . and i think its kinda like how people supported war after they were scared by news articles that the so called enemy is a threat to the way of life and action must be taken to stop it or else ... without actually having a sense about global powers and war affairs . my opinion is that politicians from both sides use these as a scare tactic to gather support . exaggerating the situation on purpose to make people panic vote for them . in the last us elections , this backfired when the democrats induced panic about climate change yet lost , leaving people still panicking about it . how to change my view : - convince me this isnt just scare tactics , either that the right wing 's pro war policies actually helped protecting the way of life from enemies or sources to the science and math that would leave no doubt that climate change is indeed a ticking time bomb that has to be diffused at this moment .","scientific studies use the scientific method that is known and accepted as the best method to understand the nature and predict futur event . and statistics also predict how likely the study in question can be False , and the datas were not representative ( it 's not as simple as that for climate change for example , since we could forget a explanation of the situation ) . so not all studies give accurate result but most of them are . 95 % , 99 % , 99.9 % , it depends on some criteria used in the statistic part ) . but we can also make meta-analysis , taking several studies and mixing them together . so i do n't think we have the opinion of a diplomacy expert is as much trustworthy as the opinion of a climate change expert . a politician will persuade you , while a scientist will convince you . in the 2018 midterms , the democrats largely ran on healthcare/the aca , the gop tax cut for billionaires , and government corruption . they certainly talked about climate change on the margins , but it was by no means a leading issue . the picked up 40 seats in the house , the largest margin they 've won since the 1970s . the earth has an atmosphere , from our perspective it looks like a vast expanse , but on the geological scale it 's actually a thin film of gas separating the earth 's crust from space . some of the gasses in this atmosphere are called greenhouse gasses because they trap the energy from the sun , which would otherwise be reflected back into space . now the science on this is pretty straightforward : the more co2 in the atmosphere , the more the earth warms up . and what ’s also pretty clear is that the level of co2 in the atmosphere has been rising fast since the industrial revolution . here is the [ famous hockey stick graph ] ( -- url -- ) to show this increase in co2 and here is a [ little list of the evidence ] ( -- url -- ) that we are causing it . there has been some discussion about how much the earth will warm up , but as our efforts progress in this matter we are getting a clearer and clearer picture about the scale of this warming . our current best estimates if we do nothing is for a rise of around 4.5 °c . this would have catastrophic effects with rising sea levels , mass migration and famine . so there is reason for alarm ( not panic ) , if you live in a democratic country , vote green . i am not a data expert so i do n't have any charts or reports with me so you 're gon na have to take this with a grain of salt . from what i have gleaned , climate change is n't going to be doomsday like it 's reported to be , but it is going to be bad . it 's subtle so many people do n't notice but it 's happening . the damage is n't a sudden event , it 's a slow trickle and that 's why we have n't done much about it . the recent reports are n't saying doomsday is approaching , they 're saying at our current rates of emmission we do n't have much time left to stop permanent damages ( i.e the climate we have now but 10 years worse and practically irreversible because it requires that we make negative emmissions on a global scale ) . scare tactics or not , the republican party has a spotty history with climate change , just look at the current administration . so i feel safer taking a bet on a democratic candidate who i believe has a higher likelihood of doing something about all this because ... ( and this is my personal bias ) regardless or not if it 's as sudden or severe as the media says it is , it will be a negative impact for future generations and i 'm currently only in high school so i fall into those future generations . i do n't want my future robbed from me because some politician never did anything to give a damn about climate change . i want to at least have someone who will try . and those are n't the republicans , scare tactics or not . - with climate science - the scientist use the scientific method to come to their conclusions . - science wants to get at the truth with the understanding that all people are biased , including them . thus , the scientific method is a way to provide empirical evidence . you can question the science , which is encouraged to arrive at the truth but you dont question a persons motives , because if you do , you are no longer doing science and coming up with a scientific conclusion . - war propaganda to support or go against is just that .... propaganda . you are trying to get peoples feelings and emotions fired up to support your cause . its objective is not truth and that is the bottom line when comparing the scientific method vs propaganda that supports someones postition ok first off affected not effected but that 's just me being nitpicky . there are two things here that make climate change support different to support for a war . there is absolute scientific consensus that climate change is real and that humans are the cause of it . this may not seem the case based on media reporting as the media always provides both sides of the argument even if only a tiny fraction of the community hold that view . if it were a town hall meeting the climate change debate would be 900 scientists all telling the one guy in the corner he 's wrong . if this were what was broadcast i think that pushback against action would be a lot weaker . the impression you get watching a panel show is that that town hall meeting would be half the room against the other half of the room , because you generally have one person from each side . that town hall meeting always has plenty of people on both sides because there is no empirical answer . there are always arguments for and against a war effort and no real way to accurately model how the war will pan out . the reports of what is going to happen to us in the case of inaction on climate change are n't getting more sensationalized , it 's that the actual consequences are getting worse and worse . when we first realised that we were affecting the environment so seriously we had plenty of time to take action and still see no negative consequences . the reports arent just getting wilder to scare people , it 's that the actual situation has worsened . "" information , especially of a biased or misleading nature , used to promote a political cause or point of view . "" though biased and misleading are relative terms i think that climate science reporting is not pushing a political agenda . the aim of taking climate action is to stop us all dying and nothing else . as said above most liberals are n’t climate scientists and most wo n’t engage and meticulously read every report that is published but they trust the authorities publishing them are scrutinised thoroughly enough by the scientific community , which is deemed more reliable that the msm and politicians justifying war or sending troops to the border etc . as for the data itself as i ’m not a climate scientist i do n’t know of much of it but i had actually read this : -- url -- the reason this article shows that climate change is an immediate threat is that it shows slrc ( sea level rise commitment ) which tells us even if we act now we are committed to 1m rise in global sea levels , if we act later or do n’t act at all we ’ll be committing to much much more . while most people are not themselves climate scientists and do able to gauge the situation by themselves , the left largely listens to scientific authorities on subjects like these , and the overwhelming scientific consensus is that the situation is dire . there 's a difference between propaganda and accepting the viewpoint of experts as being more likely to be correct and more reliable than a layperson 's opinion . would you consider it being "" affected by propaganda "" when a patient accepts being prescribed medicine by a doctor without "" understanding the complexity behind the number and graphs "" ? a lawyer telling you that you 've been breaking the law would freak you out . if you get freaked out when someone without any expertise on the subject tells you "" omg you 're going to die "" then you 've done something fundamentally different . what makes propaganda "" propaganda "" is n't that it causes people to be scared . what makes it propaganda is when it 's either actually unTrue , or lacking credibility . you can concoct absurd scenarios ( like scientists being paid off by a shady conspiracy to support climate change being real ) to introduce doubt . i understand denying anthropic climate change because you do n't want to give up your suv or whatever . anyone who has ever made a terrarium greenhouse experiment knows the basic science behind global warming . here is the 5th international panel for climate change assessment report . full of pretty graphs that simplify the complex math that basically tell anyone who reads the whole thing - climate change is a ticking time bomb ."

a1bndx,"the merit based immigration system is the best option for the us this seems like a pretty obvious solution that is supported by mainstream dems and gopers . it has also been a success in australia , canada , the uk , and new zealand . a merit based immigration system will help reduce income inequality in the nation , help fill high skilled jobs ( which currently have many vacancies ) , and will not reduce low-skilled workers ( due to visas like the hb2 ) . not only will implementing this system help the us financially and through creating a more robust workforce , it will also help facilitate a political solution to the current immigration problem , which has n't been comprehensively addressed since 1986 . i would prefer some type of immigration system resembling but not the same as the 2013 senate bill . specifically , once implemented , i would prefer that 80 % of immigrants are provided lawful permanent resident ( lpr ) status each year based on a merit based system . the rest of the immigrants given the lpr 's can be refugees and service industry/blue collar workers . i also think there should be some special exemption for souses of us citizens and children of us citizen 's that does n't count against the quota i listed , no hard cut off for the spouses , rather that would be dependent on eligibility criteria and the naturalization process already outlined in law . the blue collar workers would have a different merit based point system that i will not get into here . i think that this approach will help reduce income inequality in america , albeit slightly . it will probably also help with assimilation because immigrants will be self sufficient and not needing to live 2-3 families a house to make rent and ends meet . they also will not be dependent upon a network of immigrants from similar home-countries to find work , due to their high skill levels and experience . it will also ease assimilation through ensuring that each immigrant can speak english . it will help make the us workforce transition into the technology age and make the economy more robust . furthermore , this type of system would incentivize politicians to increase the amount of citizens provided lpr 's and also naturalized on a yearly basis . finally , it will also incentivize politicians to increase hb2 visas and the like , to be able to fill current vacancies and vacancies created by switching to a merit based system . the political aspects of this are related to political capitol and how legislation is negotiated . the merit system would look similar to the 2013 senate bill indicators and point system . i would prefer to have a hard number of necessary points for acceptance for each applicant , with a flex of 5-10 points either way so that a judgement can be made on individual 's who are close to said cutoff . "" the allocation of points in both tiers is based on a combination of factors , including education , employment , occupation , civic involvement , english language proficiency , family ties , age , and nationality . for example , 15 points are allotted for a doctoral degree , 3 points for each year of work experience in a highly-skilled job , 10 points for being a primary caregiver , and 8 points for being under the age of 24 . there is no “ passing score ” that needs to be reached to qualify . however , the system prioritizes immigrants who are young , educated , experienced , skilled , and fluent in english . ""","this cmv reads as someone who has a very shallow view of what exactly the us 's immigrant visa policy is , but without some more specifics of either what problems you 'd like to address or what type of merit-based system you 're envisioning , it 's hard to provide the types of facts necessary . i think increasing the number of high-skilled immigrants to the us is indeed beneficial , but the real debate is on whether the number of family-based and other types of immigrants should be reduced compared to its current number , and if yes by how much . some of the merit-based countries you mentioned , like australia and new zealand , actually have a similar percentage of family-based immigrants as the us , but a much higher share of work-based immigrants in comparison . the diverging opinions on whether the overall number of immigrants should be decreased is the main reason why no such merit-based law has been passed by congress yet . the us already has a merit based system , employer sponsorship . usually this only works if the employee is highly skilled and valued by the employer to go through the cost and effort of sponsorship . the only difference between australia , canada , the uk , and new zealand an us is they accept a much higher proportion of their population via merit based visas . this was a part of the 2013 bipartisan immigration reform bill that passed the senate . however , given the anti-immigrant sentiments of the president , it is unlikely we will be moving towards that in the near future . merit-based immigration systems only work in countries that are honest about what ' merit ' means , economically speaking . in canada , for instance , your english and/or french skills need to be merely passable to get you a bunch of "" merit points "" . the government acknowledges that you do n't need to read shakespeare to be a good truck driver . likewise , the canadian government is upfront about the fact that many blue collar positions need to be filled by immigrants . it 's not a political betrayal of the working class to say so ; even conservative provinces like manitoba and alberta advertise these vacancies . basically , while a merit-based immigration system has numerous upsides , the policies behind it need to be politically neutral . what merits did your people have to be let into the country . the correct answer is a combination of merit based immigration along with the constant importation of poor unskilled labor . so instead of giving immigrants low paying jobs - we import people to take to take the good high paying jobs ? let low skilled imigrants come work thier way from the bottom up . the issue weve had in the past with unskilled labor has been a lack of visas given the demand for labor on the us side and a surplus of labor on the mexico side , and not enough visas to supplement them . while there are poor people in the us that could fill these jobs , americans have mobility issues that anyone else who has put down roots . how much more would you need to make to move to rural america to work in a poultry processing plant ? there are tons of costs associated with that , particularly for the poor , who probably do n't have enough cash to fund a move , and who rely on their social and familial networks for daycare and support . i 'm not advocating for open borders , but historically , the supply of menial labor work visas has n't met the demand , and this vacuum created illegal immigration . so you could base the number of new visas issues based on economic indicators to get a rough approximation . issuing a substantial amount of menial visas would also mitigate the incentive to immigrate illegally . if you knew you could go on a waiting list for 5 years and get a menial labor visa or have to cross illegally , you would be much more likely to wait those 5 years . of course , any waiting list moves very slowly if at all , or it can be randomly assigned . the one big difference between the us and those other countries is that they do n't share a land border with poor countries"

a1bg63,"parents who refuse vaccination of their children must sign a form of accountability so if their child dies from medical complications that would have been avoided by a larger than 90 % consensus of global medical research , they can be charged with the appropriate crime ( s ) for their negligence . from my understanding ( which is n't vast on this particular subject as i am not personally a parent ) a child can begin their doctor/patient confidentiality between 14-16 depending on the state . the lifelong medical complications that arise from unvaccinated children generally have begun by this time , and that makes me believe that the accountability of the parent up to that point should be addressed and issued . vaccinations are a family choice as there are no laws ( that i 'm aware of ) requiring them , but the risk that the defenseless child and for that matter the public surrounding these unvaccinated children are put to should have some legal recourse to the parents or guardians if there is a fatal or detrimental illness that could have been avoided as a result of their decision to not vaccinate . i believe that it is fair for the consensus of medical professionals and their research to be a legitimate basis for a contract that holds parents accountable for their decision to disregard all of this if their child is harmed irreparably . this contract would allow local or state law enforcement agencies and child protective services to issue charges on the parents if they deemed necessary in the case of the parents negligence in addition to opening the possibility of the child to sue the parents for their negligence in the future if they decide to ( assuming they survive ) as well . other forms of child abuse are prosecuted , this issue should be the same . i agree that not vaccinating should be a choice , but there should be accountability and i 'm not aware of any . a parent refusing vaccinating their child and this results in them dying of an otherwise preventable illness by consensus research is the same as drowning them in a bath tub . i realize that last sentence is controversial and assume it to be taken out of context , but think of this . very rarely do unvaccinated children die immediately from the illnesses they acquire as a result of being unvaccinated , giving plenty of time for professionals to be recommending and diagnosing that the illness can be treated , but the parent refuses . they are refusing to do the thing that treats or cures their child 's illness despite all evidence to the fact . their ignorance or paranoia is no excuse to not deem this child abuse at the least and murder at the most . people get their children taken away for so many reasons in countries that turn a blind eye to holding accountability for preventable deaths . i am willing to accept that i may be missing some large angles here , but i do n't know what they are . i hope that i explained myself well , but it 's hard to fully express anything without a discussion . i welcome anyone with a contrary or parallel point of view .","but i do n’t ever bath myself or my child because i do n’t think it ’s “ natural ” to use soaps . the school eventually sees the puss fill wound and takes my kid to hospital for wound management . i ’m pretty sure at minimum the hospital would call cps and i ’d be at risk of losing my child because of neglect . it ’s hard to ignore a kid who ’s so dirty they smell from a mile away but an unvaccinated child looks the same as a vaccinated child ... until the unvaccinated one is in critical condition from a preventable disease . you do n't need people to sign a release to make them liable for negligence . normally you ask people to sign a release so that they assume responsibility for some risk that otherwise someone else is responsible for . no one is currently liable for kids getting sick off a vaccinated disease . the issue that you ’re missing is that vaccinations also protects other kids . little susie on the other hand , she ’s allergic to the vaccine and relies on kids like johnny to be vaccinated to form a metaphorical wall around her . it ’s not her parents fault she ca n’t be vaccinated , it ’s certainly not her fault or even little johnny . the issue is how to apportion blame because it ’s hard to prove that his parents have indirectly caused susie to die . i 'd argue it is closer to leaving toddler in a bathtub unsupervised and not going in to check if they 've drowned . it is closer to the probabilistic outcome - it is possible that the toddler is happy and safe in the bathtub or dead much like with vaccinated kid , it does n't require malice on part of parents , merely gross negligence . so using that analogy , your solution would be to say "" its okay to leave your toddler in a bathtub unsupervised for hours because its your choice but we 'll punish you if they drown "" . while you 've punished the guilty party , a kid is still dead . better solution might be to say "" just because its your kid does n't mean you own it , you have guardianship over the child with right to make decisions for the child provided you 're acting in best interest of the child "" . just as leaving a toddler in bathtub is not acting in best interest of the child , neither is not vaccinating kids ( medical exceptions obviously apply ) . you do n't get to use your power of guardianship to act in a way that is contrary to child 's best interests . we do n't sit around saying "" its only a problem if your ward dies "" - why should society 's protection for children ( who are essentially in same relationship type ) be lower ? no parent will ever want to get anything in the way of how they want to raise their kids . just skip forward to penalising the real problem ; fine parents who do n’t vaccinate their kids . i ’m accountable in the sense that if my gun is used in the commission of a crime , the police will knock on my door . if i am a suspect in a crime , the police will ask for my gun for testing . the problem is that laws for what happens with guns - what is or is not criminal , what is or is not negligent - are fairly well explored . a registry of unvaccinated persons , like that of firearms , might be a good idea , but having parents sign an admission of guilt for negligence that may or may not be committed is not something that has a precedent or analog that i am aware of . regarding children 's illnesses , negligence is only clear generally when parents refuse treatments for diseases their children already have . a reasonable parent who does n't take medical advice from former playmates , looking out for the best interest of his/her child could still conclude that it 's best to opt out of vaccination . for example , a line of reasoning i could understand ( but still disagree with ) would be : vaccination caries some risk ( there are legitimate reported side effects , but if everyone else 's children get vaccinated , then the risk of contracting these illnesses is still very low . a game theorist parent might opt to encourage vaccination in everyone else 's children , but opt out for his/her own . some vaccines are also given not because they are common in the united states , but because they preferentially manifest in infants , or are particularly morbid to children but not adults . polio is eliminated in the us but vaccinations are still somewhat routine , for good public health reasons ( because of high rates of immigration ) , but chances of an individual contracting polio in the united states is very low even without vaccination . that said , vaccinations should n't be avoided in general , and the autism connection ( which was originally alleged only with the mmr vaccine to begin with ) has been ruled out multiple times in multiple large studies . hypocracy on the part of the parents who opt out of vaccinations does exist - they still might feed their kids crap diets that help them develop atherosclerosis or diabetes , drive while texting with their children in their car , or otherwise engage in higher risk behavior . there is a risk-benefit analysis that can take place with vaccines as with all things , and the benefit of the doubt still needs to be extended to the parents who opt out . they are still liable for the medical bills if their children get sick , and if they took these risks based on bad assumptions , it 's on them to live with those decisions . i think in most cases , refusing tetanus vaccinations when they are recommended by doctors is pretty ignorant , as is rabies vaccines and hepatitis b vaccines . but i would like to point out that an anti-vaxxer would say the same about a parent that vaccinates their child as well ... waivers or form of accountability should be signed as to avoid any death or illness it may or can cause . i think the best way to do it would be to force all kids in public school to get vaccinated . pediatricians need to be more adamant about vaccinations to the point they wo n't see an unvaccinated child , some already do . i disagree with the drowning in bathtub part , and i think it ’s more “ not saving your child when they ’re drowning in a bathtub ” for multiple decades many doctors though playing the cello was bad for your scrotum ( they only corrected it when the doctor who sent them the letter told them it was a joke , decades later ) , for multiple centuries many procedures we now consider ineffectual at best and lethal or cruel at worst where the norm ( lobotomies for example ) . if a mind set like this was prevalent back then almost all of those procedures would have been mandatory because 90 % of doctors did agree back then . im not saying vaccination will one day join lobotomies as outdated ineffectual and cruel procedures , but i 'm saying mandating this one will leave the door open for future bad drugs and procedures to be made mandatory . it might seem great to set up a system to ensure people take vaccines , but then you ’re introducing a system whereby the government , which i might remind you is currently ( in the us ) controlled by donald trump and mitch mcconnell , has the power to force what medicine/vaccines/whatever else you must ( or must not ! ) for example , what if the action the government takes to address mental illness in the wake of mass shootings is to stretch this new provision to cover prescriptions for mental illness , because it ’s negligent to not medicate yourself if you ’re “ unstable ” ? the thought is good but the precedent is potentially too dangerous for it to be worth it . to a first approximation , one child dies of measels per year . a number of them would die before they would be vaccinated anyway , but measels xan also affect people older than 5 , so it balances out . should we hold parents as negligently causing death if their child dies of head trauma and was n't wearing a helmet ? a vaccinated population has benefits beyond the individual prevention of death in vaccine recipients . this argument is against the claim that an individual decision to not vaccinate represents an unacceptable assumption of risk to a child . i also think that if their child is the source of an outbreak or the cause of a stranger 's death that the parents are responsible for the damages . that is , having parents sign a piece of paper is n't what makes it immoral or creates legal culpability to leave their toddler alone with sharp knives . sorry , you ca n't prosecute me for leaving my child without food because i never signed a form to set of feed her ... alternate possibility , you have a tax that you have to pay to help subsidise the medical costs that will be created by choosing to not vaccinate , kind of like a carbon tax , that way you have the incentive to vaccinate without the problem of intruding on parental rights . giving an option to sign a form over vaccinations may lead to people on the fence just swinging to the form . if you fail to vaccinate your kid , you should spend 2 years minimum in prison and have your child taken away . there are far , far more likely things in a child 's life that could be argued are a direct result of parental negligence that will impact their lives at some point . i think you should lose your ability to buy health insurance ( obviously just the parent ( s ) , not the kids ) i can generally agree with common illnesses , but you fall into some shady territory here with vaccines for uncommon illnesses or vaccines with a lot of misinformation surrounding them . for instance , your average parent probably does not get their child vaccinated for illnesses which are virtually nonexistent in the usa such as small pox , ebola , or polio . if these illnesses showed up again and killed their kids , i would have a hard time prosecuting these people when they took what was actually a fairly reasonable risk ( not getting vaccinated for an illness you will likely never come into contact with in your lifetime ) which resulted in an awful outcome . for vaccines with a lot of misinformation surrounding them , i can only agree if these parents were given good information from their doctors . for example , until recently the recommendation for people with egg allergies was to not get the flu vaccine because you could have a deathly reaction . this recommendation has since changed , but parents operating off of old information , or parents who are skeptical of new information ( which is n't that unreasonable when we 're not talking about disregarding science , but being skeptical when there is a massive change in science , which is worth some skepticism ) , might still refrain from getting their kids vaccinated off of these information if their kids have egg allergies . in this scenario as an example , i would be very uncomfortable with the government prosecuting parents who acted entirely in good faith on outdated information , as this is a much less egregious action that , say , outright not getting your kids vaccinated on entirely unfounded views . the medical community has endorsed eugenics , racism , sexism , acts of war and terror via the cia , unethical use of prisoners and poor black people in government experiments , institutional sterilization of females with low status , and various dietary changes that have turned out to be orchestrated by corporations for money , instead of common good . if nothing else i ’d ask them if they want to be vaccinated the day they turn 18 . i do n't think that choosing not to vaccinate your child equates to child abuse . most school districts make it mandatory for students to have certain vaccinations , but ... there is an option for a parent to decline vaccinations for their child ( as it is their right ) and it has to be signed off by a health care provider ( md , pa , or arnp ) . in that sort of situation , are you implying that health care providers are also at fault if an un-vaccinated child gets sick and dies and should be charged with malpractice ? after being fully educated on vaccinations and medications , a patient has the right to accept or decline treatment . a parent can decline treatment for their child because that child is still a minor and needs parent/guardian approval for legal matters like this , and a health care provider has no choice but to respect their decision . i do agree that not vaccinating you or your children is incredibly selfish and stupid , but that 's their right . i 'll just vaccinate myself and my kids and teach them good hygiene habits . adding to this , even if you choose not to vaccinate your child against something like the measles and then your child gets measles ... the scenario that unfolds does n't seem like "" child abuse "" or "" neglect "" to me because there is no malicious intent there . it 's not as if parents who do n't vaccinate their kids are doing it hoping their kid gets sick and dies . anti vaxxers would just finance research that tips the scales so that so only 80 % consensus exists . inoculations are a family decision as there are no laws ( that i 'm mindful of ) requiring them , however the hazard that the unprotected kid and so far as that is concerned the general population encompassing these unvaccinated youngsters are put to ought to have some lawful plan of action to the guardians or gatekeepers if there is a lethal or hindering ailment that could have been kept away from because of their choice to not immunize . i trust that it is reasonable for the accord of therapeutic experts and their exploration to be an authentic reason for an agreement that considers guardians responsible for their choice to neglect the majority of this if their kid is hurt unsalvageably . this agreement would permit neighborhood or state law implementation organizations and kid defensive administrations to issue charges on the guardians on the off chance that they considered fundamental on account of the guardians carelessness notwithstanding opening the likelihood of the kid to sue the guardians for their carelessness later on in the event that they choose to ( accepting they make due ) also . the kid may need to be intubated and may acquire pneumonia and suffer hypoxic brain injury , sepsis , or death . if parents need to be held accountable for the harm their child might have for not getting a vaccine , vaccine manufactures should also be held accountable for any harm their product causes . likewise , if a parent is required to sign a form if they refuse vaccination , anyone who requires children to be vaccinated should also sign a form agreeing to take responsibility if the vaccine they require causes any damage/harm . you 're saying that the person should only be held accountable if the child actually suffers . what i mean by this is , if a parent were to hold a baby over the edge of a cliff , the parent would be severely punished . we do n't wait until the child falls and dies . so with this situation , it seems like we 're waiting until something happens to take action , which is a double standard . not getting vaccinated should n’t be optional it should be dome wether or not the parents approve its a public health issue . it 's too late already to punish the parents once the child is dead . you need to punish them before the child dies . so punish them with the crime the moment they refuse vaccination . most vaccines are n’t 100 % effective at preventing the disease , so the goal is to immunize as many people as possible to minimize the risk , particularly for the people who are n’t effected by the vaccine . by not immunizing your children , you are not putting only your child at risk , but clusters of un-immunized children could cause an outbreak of a preventable disease among children who got the vaccines but it did n’t work . if you did n’t vaccinate your child and there is an outbreak in your child ’s school , rec league or community , you and all of the other anti vaxxers should be held responsible for the sickness or death of the members of your community in the same way you ’d be liable for damages if you start a bonfire in your backyard and it spreads to your neighbors house . i ’ve always been this way , and now i ’m an adult and refuse to take any medications . is n't that though sorta saying we knew you as the parent was wrong , but we are only gon na punish you once your kid has carked it ? maybe a more practical and short-term remedy would be to forbid those children from attending public schools , flying on commercial flights , and other situations in which they could pose a disease threat to the public . sickness and death are natural parts of life that we must learn to deal with , and while we should definitely try and avoid sickness and illness if at all possible , finding more excuses to punish people is not the way forward . without 100 % expert consensus , you 're saying that parents should be punished for being wrong about a medical decision that a doctor somewhere would also get wrong . if not , are you willing to sign a waiver saying you 'll be held criminally liable for any elderly , pregnant women or small children who die from flu complications in your living and work areas ? the entire reason vaccines are not mandatory is because you can not force someone to inject chemicals into their body ( or the body of a child under their guardianship ) without their consent . while i strongly disagree with the act of refusing vaccinations , i even more strongly disagree with any laws which would take that freedom of choice away . so the same thing preventing mandatory vaccinations would prevent mandatory assumption of liability on the part of the parent - namely , the right of humans to exercise free will over what is put in their bodies and what contractual agreements they make . the correct way to go about this is for a judge to set a legal precedent on this in a court ruling , not a mandatory form of some kind the parent signs pre-emptively . but now the state is prosecuting parents who just lost children because they were stupid and thought they ’d be better off without vaccines ? parents are given a lot of leeway regarding the care of their own children , up to and including questionable medical decisions . they 're given approximately infinitely more leeway than as regards the treatment of other people 's children . a better argument , in my opinion , therefore fixates on the part about harm to others . not everyone can receive vaccines , which means that not vaccinating causes harm to children that are not your own . as it is difficult to measure the precise harm done by any particular vaccinated child , i think the correct move is to just cut out the middle man . not vaccinating is probabilistically harmful to children , including your own child . i ’d like to examine your view from a perspective that has nothing to do with vaccination , but with your perception of accountability . as an example , i have an ugly red hat and i wear it often . if , at some point in the future , a law was made that criminalized the wearing of ugly red hats , in order to be in compliance with that law i would have to stop wearing my hat on or before the day the law went into effect . i could not be charged with a crime for having worn it prior to the creation of that law . to be clear , i think vaccines are great , and vaccination should be acknowledged as a civic responsibility . i mean , honestly i agree with u , i think it ’s gross negligence not only to the child but also to the general public it ’s a more complicated issue because some children ca n’t be vaccinated due to auto immune issues . that ’s a part of why the vax question is such a hot issue , bc parents of children who ca n’t be vaccinated need to fear their child getting sick from all sorts of viruses already , but now need to be worried about diseases that should have died out such as polio . if we think vaccinations are important enough to forcibly vaccinate kids , just forcibly vaccinate them . see : circumcision , deciding your kid is trans , raising your kid with horrible values , etc . come to think of it , how much money should i be able to sue parents for if their adult child joins a gang , deals drugs , or gets knocked up and now is a burden on the community ? stricter punishments for a lack of vaccination will lead to more dead kids . do you take him to the hospital , where the doctors will treat this like dire physical abuse , get children 's aid involved , take your kid away , and get you charged with negligence at best ? option 2 looks tempting but it will also kill little johnny . plus , what if the procedures involved are super invasive and would leave the kid with a terrible quality of life ? plus they can be charged with gross negligence anyways in the more egregious situations . man , the day a child sues their parent for negligence of vaccinations ... well , that ’s just a good day ."
a1a6w4,"the worse the current migrant situation gets , the better the long-term prospects for our immigration system . personally , i want to allow as many good people into our country as we possibly can . and i want it to be as easy as possible for them to get in . but i also believe that it 's responsible for our country to tightly legislate immigration for our safety and security . our current immigration procedures do n't work . we ca n't handle the numbers , and we have millions of decent people living her illegally . and nobody in our government is moving to fix it . democrats and republicans will only work on this problem when the political pressure becomes intense enough . so with all that said , i hope the problem gets worse . i want to see hundreds of thousands of immigrants swarm into the border cities of mexico . i want to see trump fight back against it , upsetting mexico and his political enemies . i do n't want people to get hurt , but i want something to happen that is bad enough for republicans and democrats to both say , "" enough is enough , "" and fix the laws so that people all over the world do n't feel the need to have to sneak in and create an illicit life for themselves here . i do n't see how anything less than catastrophe will fix this .","i see migrant ( read : undocumented/illegal/non-white ) workers one time per year : apple harvest . i actually and honestly believe that the situation getting worse would make a larger , comprehensive immigration deal , like the one i think you are alluding too , untenable politically . the overwhelming majority of illegal immigrants do not come from cross the us-mexico border . the vast majority of immigrants usually come by plane and overstay their visas . one accepted number of this is 66 % of illegal immigrants overstay their visas . back in 2013 , there was a "" gang of 8 "" that worked in the senate to create this comprehensive fix . concerns over the border security . after this deal failed , the group that sunk the deal demanded that before moving on any type of immigration overhaul , border security must be address . now , if the immigration problem spirals out of control like you said you hoped for , i think both of the problems that killed the sensible immigration reform will not only come back into focus , but will have added political support at the grassroots level and thus at the congressional level . its simple , an explosion of these numbers would arm the anti-immigration wing of the gop with facts to support their concerns about border security issues and also arm them with more reasons to not allow for any type of "" amnesty "" . \ \ \ just look at how anti-immigration advocates message without the facts on their side about 66 % of illegal immigration coming from an overstay of visas and not people crossing the u.s. - mexico border . now imagine how effective they can be with the facts actually on their side . these anti-immigrant members of congress will not care about the fact that not addressing border security will continue to exacerbate the problem , as their main emphasis will be stoking their political base ( anti-immigrants ) in the hopes of getting votes . to stoke their base , it will be in their best interest to oppose any solution that does not wholly meet their demands , and drag the issue out indefinitely , while publicizing this illegal immigration explosion . example of groups that manipulate immigration facts on the right : [ -- url -- ) far right opposition to immigration reform when the issue gains more publicity : [ -- url -- ) the best chance for comprehensive immigration reform is for the issue of immigration to fade away and become a more secondary national issue . politically speaking , leadership of both parties thought that they could get the immigration bill passed under the cover of those issues . because regardless if we like it or not , when issues that involve differences of nationality , aspects of xenophobia and just a pure tribal mentality come before consideration in congress , the less exposure and publicity they receive , the more likely they are to get a compromised and holistic solution . so in sum , i think that the best chance for immigration reform would be if trump is voted out in 2020 , there is a two term president that takes his place , and an immigration bill is worked on and passed in the first two years of the new presidents term . finally , as an aside , i agree that any immigration reform would ideally include a reform of our current legal immigration process . this could potentially reduce the number of years required to receive citizenship , but would definitely include an increased number of immigrants allowed to enter this process every year , cutting down on the backlog . people who believe illegal immigration is the problem have their views reaffirmed by these events . people who believe like you are also having your views reaffirmed by these events . why do you think the migration caravan has been a rallying cry for republicans , even though you seem to think that these events strengthen your typically liberal stance ? in the end you 're left with people that have even more strongly entrenched views that are even more extreme . it is much harder to make any progress to fixing it in that system ."
a17i7c,"i think white people have societal privilege , but it 's not just their fault this is gon na be tougher to explain so bear with me , especially since this is n't my first language . so i 'd like to start off by clarifying exactly what it is i mean by "" societal privilege . "" to me , this has little to do with their current economic status , but more to do with image and personality . example 1 : white people do not seem to deal with microaggressions as often as poc , particularly black people , do . for example , i 've been told a few times in the past that i act "" white . "" the reason being because i focus on my studies , i have never skipped a class , and i 'm passive . to me , this is just like saying , "" you 're pretty for a black girl . "" even though you 're trying to be kind , you 've implied that intelligence or beauty is an inherently "" white "" trait , which is unfair . however , although white people have said this plenty of times , people of my own race have said this to me . i feel that both sides contribute to this foolishness but white people seem to be more ignorant , while the few black people who say this are either insecure ( have been lesd to believe black people can not be pretty ) or just do n't want black people to "" act white "" ( which is an absurd way of saying acting responsible ) . example 2 : white people are not pressured by either race to vote for a particular party to the same degree that black or latino people are pressured to vote for a particular party . if you 're a black person who is either apolitical ( like myself ) or leans towards the right , you can very well be decimated by other poc on social media for not being a democrat . basically , it seems that white people are generally allowed to have shifting opinions in their households or even communities more often than black people are . example 3 : white people do not deal with racial stereotypes or profiling to the same extent that black people do . and imo , this is mostly caused by white people . a popular black stereotype is the angry black woman , which is unfair . for example , a young black teenager may be upset and she is immediately considered to be some antisocial ghetto or incredibly angry bitch . while a white teenager is seen as "" moody "" or "" depressed "" and people seem to be much quicker to help them . racial profiling seems to affect black lives worse as well . besides police problems , the most common one i can think of is black people being turned down jobs or opportunities for having a "" ghetto "" name .","if you ' act white ' because you think for yourself , seek to do the right thing as you see fit , and do n't feel the need to be upset about something because ' that 's what bothers black folk ' ... then that is an issue perceived black culture , not white privilege . example 2 : not unlike the example 1 ... it is not so much white privilege that grants white people a lesser exposure to those racial pressures . the idea that ' blacks vote democrat ' or any other sort of ' group ' must vote a certain way is a symptom of identity politics than anything else . seeing groups rather than individuals is what leads to this sort of toxic thinking . in china , typical ' white behavior ' ( read : american behavior ) would be the outlier and be pressured against . you mention internalised racism but that is often and easily blamed on white people . a few things regarding example 2 , and with the assumption you are in the usa ( please correct me if i assumed incorrectly ) : people can push and persuade you , pressure you or attack you , but you get to choose who your vote goes to , and you are under no obligation to tell anyone who you picked . there 's also plenty of disagreement among white families on politics . plenty of white people who have written off friends or family because of differing view points on politics . its a sad way of life now for everyone , doesnt matter what their race is . well , i understand where you are coming from when it comes to example 2 , and i generally agree that minorities are likely pressured to vote democrat out of racial solidarity more than white people are . however , there are two points id like to make with regard to that : i think this pressure is in a large part due to the fact that republicans ( and historically conservatives of either party , though prior to the 80s mostly democrats ) have worked to either that policies that are detrimental to minority goals and communities , or to dismantle or discontinue policies that benefit minority communities . we can argue about the details of those policies and the motivations behind them , but the fact remains that it is conservatives ( now almost entirely republicans ) who are working to enact policies like voter id laws ( which disproportionately impact minorities ) and to dismantle things like affirmative action . so it 's understandable , in my view , why voting for conservatives would be seen as something of a "" betrayal "" of ones minority community . white people are absolutely pressured to follow certain political beliefs , and can absolutely be ostracized from their families and communities for different political opinions . i do agree that this generally is n't racial , though , unless we are talking about white supremacists ( who suck , generally , so being ostracized from them is probably a net positive ) . white people suffer from majority privilege . since they are the ethnic majority in the united states , they are presumed as the default . and if a poc behaves according to what the societal majority deems as proper , then they are presume to be acting like the ethnic majority , aka white . no groups of people is wholly uniform , even among homogenous societies , there are still differences among them . this majority privilege exist all over the world and is not unique to western societies . you , which i presume are a poc , feel like you have to dealt with people commenting on your whiteness when it comes to your attitude is because you are indeed acting in the way the ethnic majority acts . ultimately , the only thing that can combat this is when the majority is no longer in power , and that is a can of worms that i do n't want to see be open . tbf , i 've been arguing example 2 is really the best and perhaps only ( cmv sucka ) real example of white privilege . the fact that white people get a pass for voting republican , democrat , independent , or even not voting ( to a lesser extent ) and poc are viewed as race traitors for at least one of those , is really unfair and axiomatically True . your dad is gone , your mom is buying cocaine instead of food for you , and you are a privileged white person . the problem with "" white privilege "" is that it is a generalization . if we could find a way to accurately measure privilege , we would probably see that white americans on average have a higher level of privilege then black americans . i think its a good idea to attempt to do things to help under privileged people . why imply that a whole race of people is privileged when we know some members of that group have very little privilege ? there is some place for talking about groups of people , but i do n't think this way is productive . poll after poll has shown that black voters agree with the republican platform on a ton of individual issues far more than with the democrat 's , yet they still vote for democrats . democrats take black votes for granted , and they really should n't . if you spend more than 5 minutes walking the streets before you encounter your first angry , fat , entitled black woman , i 'll give you a dollar . and for the record , that same stereotype exists for white women too , it 's just slightly more nuanced . kinda like how you would n't hire a white guy named "" cletus "" from alabama ."
a17180,"trump 's foreign policy has been better than obama 's except for relationships with western europe & #x200b ; as a disclaimer , i am an obama voter , have worked on democratic campaigns and think trump is a terrible president . however , my work means that i talk with colleagues from a number of other countries , particularly in africa and the middle east , and i was initially surprised to find out that they almost uniformly prefer trump to obama . previously , my thought was that trump really just made everything worse by making bombastic statements ( not committing to nato , escalatory rhetoric with nk , threatening trade wars and insulting leaders of china , canada , mexico and europe ) as well as possible russia ties . the arguments made by my colleagues generally fall into two categories that i think both make a lot of sense : & #x200b ; 1 . obama was a disaster for the middle east . the us during his administration instigated the arab spring , sparking violence throughout the region but then not providing any further assistance . obama is also responsible for the disaster that is syria , escalating it into a massive military and humanitarian crisis that has created massive refugee issues for the whole region ( and into europe ) , while the us media ( especially cnn which has ties to the clintons ) greatly exaggerated the negatives of bashar al-assad 's regime . furthermore , and i do n't know how much there is to this but this is what my colleagues claim , isis was created and militarily supported by the us ( obama specifically ) and was a major cause of conflict in the region , whereas now they have all but disappeared . pretty much everyone seems to think everything would have been much better without us intervention . meanwhile trump is a lot more isolationist and has scaled back our presence in syria and iraq , stopped the bombings , etc. which has come with a decline in violence in the region . 2 . the other point is one that i have much more trouble responding to . basically , they almost all seem to prefer trump 's tone to obama 's . in general , my colleagues do n't seem to mind having their countries called shitholes and do n't care about trump 's racism , but they did n't like obama 's sanctimonious tone and , in their view , his condescending demeanor of talking down to the rest of the world like some "" paragon of virtue "" . they went on for awhile about how obama always seemed to believe he was in the right and did n't like their countries because they were n't "" democratic enough "" while simultaneously dealing with larger autocratic states . they also repeatedly echoed a line i 've heard from my conservative family in the us that at least trump "" tells it like it is "" , which they find to be a stark contrast to obama 's lofty rhetoric while stabbing them in the back , in their words . & #x200b ; this all came as a big surprise to me and i found that i was unable to defend obama and clinton in any meaningful way . since looking into it and doing research i think i 'm even more on their side that trump is better than obama on foreign policy . in the long run , it seems unlikely that our relationship with western europe will be noticeably worse ( see obama nobel peace prize just for not being bush and the rebound of relations in 08 ) , decreasing presence in the middle east/less instigation of violence in mena region ( which is good to me since i was against those wars in the first place ) , and his negotiating style seems to have worked in getting the us a better deal in nato , having real negotiations ( and bodies returned ) from nk , getting european allies to increase military expenditure , etc . & #x200b ; incidentally , this all came about because i mentioned that i voted for clinton over trump ( which i thought would be as uncontentious as when i said it in europe ) , and they all immediately went off about how clinton would have been one of the worst presidents ever and ruined the middle east and africa for decades and questioned how i could feel anything but hatred for clinton . for what it 's worth , i was never big on clinton ; i liked obama much more , was a sanders supporter in the primary and consider myself to be to the left of the democratic party in general .","arguing that president obama was popular in just western europe is n't accurate , though . areas of the middle east and africa preferred president obama as well . the obama administration did put pressure on some governments not to use their military to slaughter crowds of unarmed protesters . the south koreans needs president trump at the table , so they flattered him , acted like the negotiations were his idea and that he was winning at it . i do n't know if i will give this post effort because soooo much is wrong with your first point . furthermore , it was a good thing that obama did n't get involved in the arab spring , as nothing of substance was likely to change . the fundamental context of the middle east is , and has almost always been , ripe for despotism and authoritarianism . all that obama did was arm the kurds to give them a fighting chance at survival , instead of a proto-genocide fate . the syrian civil war is sectarian in nature and spawned from the arab spring . finally , trump originally escalated bombing and then began drawing forces down . in sum , point one is completely bogus and not founded on truth . point two is a point of substance and style , which is subjective . i could make arguments about why obama made some really bad mistakes foreign policy wise , ie , libya , syria red line comment and not using miliatary strikes to deter chemical weapons use , how he handled russia , how he handled aspects of iraq and afghanistan , the south china sea/asian pivot , etc etc . correct me if i 'm wrong , but obama did n't illegally take campaign money from russia or put children in cages . it 's refreshing to see someone so far left who recognizes the social ostracization brought about by associating at all with trump or the right . wish we could talk about economics sometime , cause i feel that 's so often what differentiates the far left from libertarians like myself . trump has legitimized those voices in many countries , not just the us . trump : family relations and loyalty matter above all . he inherited his money and power from his father and wants to give the same privilege to his children , even if people who are n't related to him are better qualified to lead . trump : the dominant group in society is better than others . every country has people with obama style views and people with trump style views . it 's just that currently , the obama style views are slightly more popular in europe ( although many right wing parties like alternative for germany , and the national rally , previously national front , in france are becoming popular too . ) trump style views are more popular with the most powerful in africa and the middle east where people with competing views are limited from getting leadership roles . trump 's approach to women is very popular with men who also treat women like sex objects . in countries where polygamy is legal outright , and affairs are common , it makes sense that they would relate to trump . in countries where family loyalty is more important than a meritocracy , trump 's views are popular . for example , china liked trump at first before they realized he actually wanted to start a trade war with them . finally , this approach to tribalism where the most powerful social group in a country gets to dominate over others is popular amongst people who are part of that powerful social group . where obama used to make them feel guilty , trump justifies their views . so if you get a group of rich , powerful men together from many countries and promote ideas that benefit rich , powerful men , everyone there would be happy . the only problems is when one of those rich , powerful men picks a fight with another one . the issue is that the world is changing and it 's no longer good foreign policy to just appeal to rich , powerful men . irregardless , china is a current world power , and an extremely authoritarian one at that . china is well know for restricting free speech , extensively monitoring its citizens , and has now created the social credit system . to tl ; dr the social credit system : if you do n't support the government , the government will force your employer to fire you , will restrict what schools you ( and your children ) can go to , where you can live , and your ability to even leave the country . while trump is tacking on tariffs , china is rebuilding the silk road into europe . trump also took the us out of the tpp , which would have given the us a much greater presence in the asian market , and the freedom to exert more economic pressure on china . basically , trump limited his own ability to exert pressure on china . tl ; dr : trump is ignoring the biggest threat to the west and freedom , and does n't get that multilateral > unilateral"
a11ihh,"trump has done nothing of substance since being elected to office . this is kind of a counter to the other post made recently about trump being a great president . he pointed out things like the economy , which was growing before he even took office and it actually seems to be growing less then it really should since he inherited and extremely strong economy that obama fixed . the opioid bill , but there really is n’t any president who would of turned that down so i ’m not sure that really counts . he did n’t do anything , just signed it . people also mention 4 million added jobs , but he ’s actually added jobs at a slower pace then obama did . so that ’s a rather poor example . they also claim that attacking our allies with tariffs is good business , and i just ca n’t find any information or sources that suggest it ’s actually helpful to the economy . i know missouri , my home state , has been hurt immensely by these tariffs . i ’m pretty far left , but i ’m trying to keep an open mind . i honestly feel like he has done nothing but hurt our country . i would really appreciate it if someone could put solid arguments up with sources . sources can not be youtube , or any far right news source .","look , i get that the recently elected south korean president had a large part in the negotiations , but had any other american president since nixon 'd been in power ( what with the "" my way or the high-way "" attitude that is typical of american foreign policy ) , things 'd not have gone the way things did . that said , hypothetically speaking , if a president came in and implemented a ton of regulations and spending policies , then the economy would not be nearly as strong as it is today . signed legislation to roll back costly and harmful provisions of dodd-frank , providing relief to credit unions , and community and regional banks . the first issue is targeted at small banks ( normally in rural areas like the midwest ) . the result of this over-regulation was that many banks were not allowed to lend out money , meaning some rural areas already facing decline , faced credit crunches - people could n't buy homes or purchase equipment for their farms ect . essentially , the regulation would have allowed over-zealous epa officials to go onto people 's farms and regulate puddles of rain water . this regulation would have potentially stalled industry investment for the agriculture and energy sectors , which would have been disastrous for an already struggling midwest economy . rolling back this regulation was ultimately a good thing , and the waterways are still protected . responded to the use of chemical weapons by the syrian regime . rolled out sanctions targeting individuals and entities tied to syria ’s chemical weapons program . directed strikes in april 2017 against a syrian airfield used in a chemical weapons attack on innocent civilians . joined allies in launching airstrikes in april 2018 against targets associated with syria ’s chemical weapons use although the strike was limited , i think it was proportional and appropriate . the long and short of it , is trump 's strikes help uphold international norms against using chemical weapons . action to combat russia ’s malign activities , including their efforts to undermine the sanctity of united states elections . imposed sanctions against five russian entities and three individuals for enabling russia ’s military and intelligence units to increase russia ’s offensive cyber capabilities . sanctioned 100 targets in response to russia ’s occupation of crimea and aggression in eastern ukraine . trump signed russian sanctions passed through congress aimed at penalizing russia for their election meddling . similar to his air strikes in syria , these sanctions are a necessary first step for maintaining our election integrity , and upholding global norms against meddling in foreign elections . russia is a nuclear power and therefore we can not use military escalation . if russia meddles again , these sanctions will be used as justification to seriously ratchet up our response . although there has n't been any major policies to address border security , trump has drawn attention to the issue . trump 's focus on border security hopefully will bring increased security during the next immigration bill negotiations ( probably the next president ) . are you going to language away all the bad things based on external factors , or is he going to be responsible for those ? tax cuts ( it helped me , so i 'm counting it ) north korea is on a good track to peace with south korea . we have 12 million illegal immigrants in the country , mostly from people who crossed over illegally from mexico . the us loses tens of billions of dollars per year to this , and the chinese government is complicit and refuses to extradite its citizens who steal us tech secrets . trump approved legislation to allow people with terminal illnesses to undergo experimental trials if they agree to the risks , something that was n't allowed before he took office ."
a11ava,"terrorism and school shootings are blown way out of proportion when compared to other political issues there is a lot of discussion about terrorism and school shootings . it seems that many people consider them to be significant issues that warrant a large amount of attention . however , many political issues that are just as if not more important like the economy and justice system receive far less attention in relation to how important they are . it 's extremely unlikely that an american will be injured or killed by a terrorist attack or school shooting while the vast majority of americans are impacted by the state of the economy and millions of people have their lives changed in dramatic ways by the justice system . i do n't see why terrorism and school shootings warrant the amount of attention they get when more important issues dont receive their due amount of attention . > this is a footnote from the cmv moderators . we 'd like to remind you of a couple of things . firstly , please read through our rules . if you see a comment that has broken one , it is more effective to report it than downvote it . speaking of which , downvotes do n't change views ! any questions or concerns ? feel free to message us . happy cmving !","every 10 years or so a large commercial airliner will crash and the crew and passengers will die your chances of getting hit by lightning are greater than your chances of being a victim of a school shooting or terrorism i am going to go with terrorism and stay away from school shootings . as opposed to the complexity of the judicial system , financial system or international trade policy , which has many differing views and many important variables to consider , terrorism can be described in black and white terms . therefore , people watching the news can understand what happened and who did the bad act , unlike the complex issues i mentioned above . the simplicity of the issue makes it natural for it to be conveyed by the media . it naturally draws viewers which in turn drives percentage and prominence of coverage . coverage of terrorism is warranted for a few different reasons , mainly because it is a segway for a discussion of national defense , national security and personal liberty issues . terrorism can be used to inform the public of world events happening in ' hot ' regions . while the us may get 1 terrorist attack in 4 months , places like iraq and afghanistan , where the us is spending billions of dollars and losing lives of our soldiers , experience attacks like that on a weekly/daily basis . therefore , coverage of domestic terrorist attacks seeps into the events happening where our troops and dollars are going . another reason why terrorism deserves coverage is because we have no idea how many potential terrorist attacks are thwarted on a daily basis . we do n't know what the cia and fbi due to prevent these attacks , therefore , although the coverage may seem outsized to you , it is probably much more proportional than we know about due to these thwarted attempts . these two issues play into overall defense funding for our nation . if terrorist attacks are n't properly covered , and the public is n't away of the carnage overseas and the potential threats that the cia and fbi thwart due to non reporting of these issues , defense funding would likely be continually cut . these cuts would happen until something really bad happens ( like how we cut financial regulations until we face a depression , continually , throughout history ) . therefore , the ' out-sized ' coverage these attacks may receive , help to keep security issues in the mind of the citizens . fourth , coverage of these smaller terrorist attacks , and the subsequent increase in security and defense funding , prevent the larger terrorist attacks . therefore , you can view the coverage as a preventative measure . this is useful due to the extreme effect that attacks like 9/11 can have on our nations economy and policy for the next 30 years . preventing 9/11 would have prevented the recession that followed , the afghanistan and iraq war , saving the us trillions of dollars , thousands of lives and time on policy debates that ideally would be used to fix our other domestic issues . fifth , civil liberties is an issue that gets discussed alongside terrorism . this is an important issue that does n't receive nearly the coverage it deserves . otherwise , when there is a terrorist attack , responsible networks also bring up the civil liberties debate by having people like alan dershowitz on ."
a103ud,"free trade for the us is good , trump 's and bernie sander 's manufacturing job and ip loss arguments are red herrings and only being used for political points . the question is pretty simple . i think that fair trade , meaning the status quo and tpp , is good , the sanders/trump argument \ \ \ against it faulty ( and i have n't heard another comprehensive economic argument ) . furthermore , to point out the benefit of fair trade , i will use trump 's tariffs as an example of negative anti-fair trade policy . \ \ \ the sanders/trump argument against tpp is that it will exacerbate manufacturing job loss and ip theft . tpp is important because it would have reworked nafta and added in the pacific arena . please remember , manufacturing jobs have already been lost and probably are n't coming back to the us . note : while certain protective tariffs are necessary , such as nominal auto tariffs or certain agriculture tariffs , those are implemented through negotiation and part of a comprehensive economic plan . most importantly , these tariffs protect industries that not will inevitably die , and do so without completely harming the us economy . manufacturing tariffs or trade deals focused on protecting the us manufacturing sector would have seriously hurt the us economy and raised the price of good for most lower and middle class americans . manufacturing and ip losses to china and other 3rd world countries : 1 . ip is being stolen by china and really is n't a result of fair trade . plenty of us companies open up factories in china and that is why the us companies are losing ip . another reason why ip is being lost , is china is simply buying up us companies . there are a ton of examples of this , but off the top of my head , you can look to the smithfield purchase . china buys these companies and then takes their ip for themselves . this is simply unavoidable in a fair and open society . as to the ip theft , there can be some coercive measures to slow down the theft through the wto , but its extremely hard to prove the theft occurred . regardless , ip theft is not a result of fair trade . 2 . the loss of manufacturing jobs was inevitable for a few reasons and all that fair trade has done is to sped up the inevitable loss in the short term , while making goods far cheaper for the lower and middle class consumer . fairtrade has helped to make the us economy more robust due to increased exports . why was the loss of manufacturing jobs inevitable ? a few reasons . 1 . labor laws in the us , including minimum wage and osha regulations , which are both good things , make the us unable to compete fairly with 3rd world nations like mexico and china . 2 . environmental regulations further widen the competitive gap . 3 . automation will make almost all us factory workers obsolete , regardless of the first two points . just look at any major meat packing facility , or auto-manufacturing plant , most of the jobs are already automated . a cow goes in and a frozen hamburger gets packed in the matter of 3 hours with minimal human contact . again , all that fair trade has done is helped reduce the cost of goods and help the us economy . anyone attacking both ip and manufacturing losses as reasons why they are against fair trade are using a red herring argument . both trump and sanders are extremely guilty of this because they do n't understand the real issues . as an aside , closing off the us markets leads to economic recession/depression . this is pretty much accepted as objective fact by people knowledgeable on the subject . "" although economists disagree by how much , the consensus view among economists and economic historians is that ' the passage of the smoot – hawley tariff exacerbated the great depression . ' "" [ -- url -- ) closing off trade markets also reduces the us ' influence in the world due to reducing economic interdependence . this is not a good thing . trump trade policies : an argument against hackneyed tariffs and starting trade wars the argument in favor of these actions would be that through targeted tariffs , the us would be able to hurt china 's economy enough to garner major trade concessions from them , further opening up their markets and increasing enforcement of trade laws / ip theft . this will not work for one simple reason . any tariffs that are placed on china from the us that have the necessary impact on china , would not only hobble china , but it would send the us into a recession . the price of goods would skyrocket , our exports would stall and a general downward spiral would ensue . furthermore , one could argue that targeted tariffs against china in order to pressure them into accepting an already created new trade framework , might be a positive use of tariffs . the problem is that the existing trade framework , which was aimed at ultimately reducing china 's ip theft of us products and other malevolent and illegal trade practices , called tpp , was thrown in the waste bin by the trump administration . therefore , the manner in which the trump administration is approaching these tariffs , or any administration approaches are trade war , is not productive . another important fact to note is that when a trade war begins , and tariffs are placed on us products , this not only hurts the us export community and economy in the immediate term , but it also has long last effects . for example , currently farmers are getting crushed by soy bean tariffs and other tariffs on their farm products . this will bankrupt many farmers and result in a major shift in the farming economy , ie . moving away from soy to other , non-tariffed goods . finally , when a sector loses market share in a trade war/dispute , the negative impacts of that dispute are almost always long lasting . article on immediate impacts faced by farmers : [ -- url -- ) longer term impact on us soy markets : [ -- url -- ) so to sum up trump 's approach to china , and the rhetoric used by many anti-trade progressives , they are harping on red herrings and ignoring the circumstances and facts related to globalism and fair trade in favor of political points , trump 's trade policies are hackneyed , and trump took away the only real and effective tool for the us to curb china 's poor trade practices - tpp .","there is a push and pull between corporate profits and standards of living - and you can not create a system in which you have unfettered trade and an unfettered capitalist market that also sustains a decent standard of living for the average person . the principals of capitalism are a race to the bottom - cutting corners to maximise profits . the principals of improving standards of living is ideally a race to the top , avoiding cut corners and improving infrastructure , sustainability , and comfort at the expense of pure profits . what pure capitalism ignores is the human cost of production , and the costs put upon society and future generations . and yes - a purely socialist approach is also not ideal because it can lead to stagnation , lack of competition , and dragging behind on technical process . trump 's policies , on the other hand , have sought to encourage runaway capitalism and attempt to revitalise broken industries ( such as coal ) just for the sake of earning political points with rural americans and big money donors . while neither might be the perfect balance - the massive increase in the federal deficit that trump has added so far in his presidency is evidence that his regressionist approach is proven not to work.as further evidence , we also just saw gm come out and state that the massive tariffs imposed on steel are driving them out of business and forcing them to close down their us factories and lay off 14k employees - while maintaining factories in china and mexico . and yet historically we know that strong socialised economies do work to revitalise the economy - see here hoovernomics and the great depression . neither extreme of the spectrum might be the correct solution - but clearly favouring strong unfettered capitalism has proven itself time and time again to be worse than strong regulation and social nets when implemented intelligently ( see europe ) ."
a0zoi3,""" positive discrimination "" / "" affirmative action "" is immoral and has no place in society . hey all , been quite a while since i 've done a cmv but i feel quite strongly on this issue so i thought it would be interesting to bring my case forward to you guys . i strongly dislike the policy of positive discrimination/affirmative action for a number of reasons . i would outline my case as follows : i think the notion that we should designate certain privileges to a person simply on the basis of their race/sex alone detracts from the principle of equality of opportunity in favour of equality of outcomes . the principle justification behind this as far as i 'm aware is that the motion targets groups that it suggests are generally underrepresented or perceived to often be treated unfairly : firstly , i feel that this discrimination based solely on race/sex is inherently racist/sexist respectively by any definition of the words , and furthermore that the label of "" positive discrimination "" is misleading , since all discrimination is positive towards one group while negative towards another . secondly , i fundamentally disagree with the notion that such discrimination is in any way justified , and i feel this way for two reasons : 1 ) i am sceptical of the purported scale of modern-day sexism and racism in the western world ( as a quick aside , this argument is going to be entirely focussed on the usa and uk ) . i do n't feel that there is compelling evidence to support the notion of the existence of systemic sexism or racism on an international or otherwise grand scale . 2 ) i strongly disagree with the idea that it is logical or progressive to lump people under a group identity or label and then suggest that members of this group should be given special treatment simply because of statistical differences between that group and the population majority . i think it far better to operate on principles of equal opportunity rather than equal outcome ; if two applicants for a university or job are being considered , their individual qualifications and merits should be considered . if two university applicants are equally qualified but one graduated from a prestigious university from a wealthy family background while the other came from a broken home with little to no formal schooling , then that second candidate 's ability to perform well despite poor conditions in their personal life should be considered . however , if two candidates are presented , one with significantly better qualifications than the other , and the only discerning factor that sets them apart is race , then to pick the lesser qualified candidate is definitively racist . these things should be decided by individual merits and demerits , which is exactly what interviews are for . affirmative action removes this ability for individual comparison in favour of a collectivist , impersonal system of group identity . along with many other principles geared towards equality of outcome rather than equality of opportunity , affirmative action is , i think , self-defeating . it begs the question of where to stop . do you divide by race ? perhaps subdivide by gender ? where do you go from there ? should we subdivide again by household income ? personality ? age ? religion ? the cycle is endless , until eventually you get all the way down to the most basic and fundamental group identity there is ; the individual . and we 're back to evaluating on individual merits and demerits , as we should . ergo , the notion of equal outcomes is not progressive , but regressive ; it simply removes the intricacies of individual consideration in favour of a group identity which can then be granted privileges ( or denied them ) based on an impression of a generalised identity which an individual person may not accurately represent . in conclusion , i believe affirmative action/positive discrimination to be unfair , immoral , unjust and totally in conflict with the thoroughly desirable concept of equal opportunities ; we should be striving to treat individuals fairly and equally , evaluating them based on their individual attributes , not discriminating based on group identity in the interest of the regressive and rather totalitarian principle of equal outcomes . let me know what you guys think on the subject ! i 'd be very happy to hear your thoughts and perhaps you can change my mind on this topic . thanks for your time !","so , i mean , the evidence is very clear : anti-black hiring discrimination is alive and well . the discrimination in schools is a very important part , because if the schools are discriminatory then we really ca n't claim to be a meritocracy , can we ? we also ca n't forget all the structural barriers to success that minorities , particularly black americans , face . the us government has pursued a variety of policies that have allowed white people to accumulate wealth ( such as subsidizing mortgages ) while excluding black americans from those benefits . the massive wealth gap between black and white americans is a direct result of these policies . i think about it this way : it is much harder to get straight a 's and get into college as a black person than as a white person , which says that if a black person and a white person both perform equally well , the black person has more aptitude because he had to work harder to get where he is . since i want people with more aptitude to work for me , it is rational to consider his race as something that indicates he is going to be a better employee . for other people , their sense of guilt over the discrimination is enough , but i like my justification better . you seem to misunderstand the goal and history of affirmative action . the goal is not even to benefit the "" recipients "" of affirmative action . we need to have future generations of ceos , judges and teachers who represent ' underrepresented ' minorities . bussing is moving minorities from segregated neighborhoods into white schools . the idea is for white people to see black faces and the diversity that similar appearance can hide . seeing that some blacks are americans and some are africans would be an important part of desegregation . if we believe separate but equal is n't acceptable , the next question is , what 's the least harmful solution . however , do to the effects of desegregation top tier schools do make the difference for minorities only affirmative action is n't charity to those involved and it is n't supposed to be a sober look at the effect of bussing on the kids who were sent to schools with a class that hated them asked that it was n't a charity . evidence shows that students who are pulled into colleges in which they are underrepresented puts them off balance and often has bad outcomes for those individuals . the essence of innocence : consequences of dehumanizing black children : found that participants estimated black boys to be older and less innocent than white boys of the same age racial disparities in school discipline are growing , federal data show the data are damning : how race influences school funding : "" if you color code the districts based on their racial composition you see this very stark breakdown . at any given poverty level , districts that have a higher proportion of white students get substantially higher funding than districts that have more minority students .

a0znvw,"using gun violence as an argument against the united states makes no sense . basically what the title says . it 's clear that the united states has elected a globally unpopular president . amidst the surge in internet usage and advancement the spread of misinformation and fake news media has conflated our politics . and that 's not to shift blame to trump or obama . i very much want to reiterate that i am not here to support or defend donald trump or any thing happening with current politics . i am simply stating that gun violence isn not nearly as bad as people think it is . school shootings/gun violence : there appears to be a huge misconception from outside the united states on how often school shootings occur . 1 . \ [ school shootings are a rare occurrence and the odds of being killed in a school shooting are less than 1 % . \ ] ( [ -- url -- ) ) 2 . \ [ the odds of being killed by a firearm in the united states is less than that of being poisoned . \ ] ( [ -- url -- ) ) what people from other countries do n't understand is that we value gun ownership . we have read the history of what happens to people who have no way of defending themselves . countless wars and casualties . vietnam was a country made up of militias of citizens and they ( if you ask them ) stopped us . that is the power of civilian gun ownership . we own guns because it 's a value we 've had since our inception . that 's really it . the removal of guns from the hands of citizens would cause a civil war which would result in more deaths than if we continue to let guns remain legal . "" but even one death/school shooting is worth getting rid of them "" \ - not True , as mentioned above about removing citizens weapons would cause more deaths.-if just a few deaths are worth removing something , then theres no reason that the people who advocate for the abolition of guns are n't also advocating for the abolition of alcohol since you 're more likely to die in a drunk driving accident.-you are more likely to die from any other cause of death in any other first world nation than you are from gun violence in the united states . to conclude my point on gun violence some will point out how many "" mass shootings "" happen each year . "" mass shooting "" has no definition that is consistent with what news state . often times one person will simply be shot without dying and it will be considered a mass shooting .","and i believe gun violence , or violence in general are factors that matter . ( and you can have guns and low gun violence , example : switzerland , but i guess you must get an headache from seeing again and again that name in that kind of conversation ) i 'm not going to address the issues regarding american opinions on firearm ownership etc. because i 'm sure that someone else can deal with that much more aptly than i can . i want to focus specifically on your claims regarding incidence of gun violence and why that 's worth criticism in and of itself . strictly speaking , your source mentions accidental firearm discharge , not all deaths from gun violence , so the lifetime odds are likely to be misleading . it also only seems to use data for one year ( 2006 ) . in contrast , this study found that nearly one-third of all worldwide mass shootings between 1966 and 2012 occurred in the usa ( where mass shooting is defined as the killing of 4 people by a single gunman , but excluding gang killings , domestic violence , or terror acts sponsored by an organisation ) . i think there was also a washington post article ( locked behind a paywall - i 've no more free articles this month ) that showed the usa had the highest number of mass shootings of any single country . if italy turned out to have the highest infant mortality in the world , or france the poorest education , would these be open to criticism ? in the same vein , the usa should be criticised for having the worst track record in mass shootings of any country in the last half-century . sure , the source you quoted puts accidental gun discharge at about 1 in 5000 . but actually , the national center for health statistics used 2014 data to place the lifetime odds of death by gun assault ( encompassing all deaths where a gunshot was fatal - excluding suicides . full methodology on their website ) at 1 in 370 , with the lifetime odds of a mass shooting as 1 in 15,000 or so . this tallies much better with the fact that about 11,000 us citizens die each year as a result of gun violence ( based on 2014 data - in the link above ) . so , in conclusion , based on all of that , let me turn the question back around to you : if one of the world 's most advanced economies had the highest number of mass shootings in the last half-century , and you had a greater lifetime odds of dying in a gun-based homicide than in a road-traffic accident inside a car/van , how could that not be open to criticism , irrespective of sociopolitical context ? ie how many forign films , books , news do you consume vs the inverse . its not just holding gun ownership as axiomic that draws the criticism , though most countries do consider that to be a bad trade . there are countries with a larger percentage of gun owners ( though not guns per capita having 1 guy own 50 guns is uniquely american and breaks that stat ) czechia have ingrained civilian gun ownership going back as far as guns have existed and concealed carry is widespread , ( they coined the term pistol ) but only a single mass shooting in modern times . for example every other country in the world requires guns be safely stored . this is no more an infringement on gun ownership than being arrested from yelling bomb in a crowded building is a curtailment of free speech . americans though widely reject any and all gun control banning sawn off shotguns ( a weapon that can only be used for crime ) had to go the supreme court . simpme little measures like this could save hundreds of lives . this totaly rekless aproach leads to absurd outcomes , more americans are shot by toddlers than killed by terrorists . no other country in the world has anyone shot by toddlers , i ca n't find even one case . then we have the lack of any mental health or criminal background checks in certain states . in conclusion it 's not so mich your gun rights but lack of regulation and personal responsibility so often shown . there are many countries with long histories of firearms limitation and control that have not experienced subjugation . pointing that the level of violence in us is high , does not equal to having a solution , or implying that solution is banning guns . school shootings in the us do happen much much much more than in other developed countries . so kids in the us are 100x as likely to experience a school shooting . what you forgot to mention is that the most likely person to be killed with your gun is yourself ."
a0x65c,"beheading is no more immoral than any other form of capital punishment okay , big disclaimer first of all : i think beheadings are a sick and absolutely barbaric act . i am not claiming beheadings are not immoral . i am against the death penalty in all forms . however , for this sake of argument , i 'm going to start on a premise that the death penalty is not immoral . in this scenario , i do n't see why beheading is any worse than any other form of execution . it seems more barbaric than say lethal injection but that is really just because of social conditioning that we see one as okay but not the other . some of you may say it is more painful and that is why it is immoral , but lethal injection in the united states can actually be incredibly painful and the put you in paralysis first so those observing wo n't hear you scream . please keep in mind , once again , i am not approving of beheadings . i am just saying that if we start on the basis that the death penalty is okay , and someone has received proper due process and is being punished for an actual serious crime , beheading is not worse than most ways we execute prisoners now .","for starters , a beheading makes it impossible for the family to have an open casket , which may go against the customs of some people . in some cultures the head is sacred , if i remember correctly , in medieval england it was believed that if you were beheaded you could n't go to heaven or something , this religious fear for some makes it immoral . for a beheading to be a clean cut you 'll need to buy a well-crafted sword , let 's take a katana which us good at cutting , for a high quality one made by an authentic swordsmith you 're looking at £ 1000-ish , and now you need a swordsman who is psychologically strong ( a big reason hitler went from shooting jews to gassing them is because of they psychological effect it had on the soldiers ) and readily available , because an un-trained guy with a sword has a high-fail rate , let 's say we pay this swordsman £ 100 per beheading , i 'm assuming there are n't enough prisoners to justify officially hiring him , even then the cost would probably be higher . i think you get the idea , beheading costs more than other methods because of the specialised nature of it , it 's immoral to charge the population more for no real gain . you could argue that it would be the same wether they knew they 'd be decapitated or lethally injected but ( assuming both processes went smoothly ) i think a lot of people would be more traumatized at the idea of having their head chopped off . that being said , morality is a social construct and so what is moral or immoral is defined by the society in which it is taking place , therefore morality varies from one culture and society to another . so for instance in the united states it is considered immoral by societal standard to behead someone , but not immoral to use lethal injection . in other societies and tribes it is viewed as moral to behead depending on the crime . i mean even in the u.s. different states with different regional cultures define morality differently . so the scientific evidence you 're using to support or deny morality claims is irrelevant in some societies since culture is a driving force of what is considered moral or immoral . i would much rather take a chance at being put to sleep with an anesthetic and then have my heart turn off with the help of an injection . or shot ... survivors of high caliber rifle rounds in ww1 often reported that they did n’t feel any pain the ground just “ rushed up to them ” beheading , when done right , is one of the most humane forms of capitol punishment . it is one of the quickest and least painful deaths that you can administer . in comparison , us states that carry out the death penalty use amateurs to administer the fatal cocktail of drugs . the guillotine is a more effective form of capitol punishment . for beheading to be a quick death , it needs to be done cleanly with a single stroke . societies that still practice beheading are n't using guillotines , this probably happens more often than you would think . finally , if you consider the means we are starting to develop for non-punitive euthanasia , there is no way that beheading would be the most humane means of execution . if you believe that it 's immoral to cut and disembody corpses for no practical reason then you will find beheading immoral too , as it 's completely unnecessary to reach the goal of death punishment . beheading seems to be certainly painful whereas lethal injection results in many painless deaths , despite various hiccups and other occasional failures . a bullet to the head is a form of execution . beheading is no more immoral than any other form of capital punishment the idea behind a "" humane "" execution is for it to be as quick and painless as possible . beheadings carry a connotation of old medieval executions , and extend to the overuse of the guillotine in the french revolution . connotations aside , beheadings were considered to be relatively humane until it was observed that the eyes in a severed head were capable of purposely tracking a person 's movements for several minutes , and showed signs of life for about 15 minutes . to my knowledge , bombings are not used as a death penalty method anywhere . theoretically , if we put people under anesthesia before dragging them over to the guillotine and cutting their heads off , that would , yes , be the same as lethal injection . beheading is a much more violent method of execution , with a much more gory result , which would in all likelihood have some traumatic effect on others in addition to the prisoner ( he dies , they have to live with it ) . it 's there to instill fear in people , to show how they take a person , and they remove his head from his shoulders , they turn a person into a body in a mere second ( or sometimes longer ) , its something that makes people afraid , and also makes the death into a much bigger thing . lethal injection is a much "" calmer "" way to end a life , you see no sign of death , the heart simply stops beating , the person simply stops living , it is a punishment rather than proving a point , rather than putting on a display . as for the pain , i do n't know if they do so already , but in my opinion people should be given anesthetic ( put to sleep like in surgery ) before being killed , that way they feel no pain . i do n't believe we carry out lethal injection because it is of a greater moral virtue than beheading , but because of exactly what you have mentioned , it is socially viewed as less barbaric and more humane . from an ethical point of view , the most humane method ought to be carried out as to serve "" justice "" instead of revenge . there is a reason isis beheads in a public square . it is the image of beheading , not the humane nature of the death that is off-putting . to draw an interesting parallel , it is probably relatively painless to be gassed , if done correctly . if a society is symbolically executing people in a barbaric way , then they are expressing to the world that no form of punishment is beneath them if you break certain laws . that they represent revenge as a mode of justice , which many would perceive to be , immoral . when you behead someone , you destroy the integrity of their body . i think you would agree it would be wrong to cut the head off of a cadaver , for no purpose but to do it . the person is not having a bad experience , they are dead . a lethal injection does not destroy the integrity of the body . it is perceived as gruesome to see a family members head cut off . with lethal injection , it is painful to see but it appears like the person is going to sleep . imagine we instead of beheading , threw the person into a blender . methods like lethal injection , the electric chair , or even hanging are much better and with far less cleanup . compared to us lethal injections , beheading does n't seem any more or less unpleasant . compared to a heroin overdose , i think any other method of killing seems barbaric ."
a0tquh,"there is no such thing as positive discrimination ( i.e. having a quota to hire women ) . it 's all negative against someone . so first i should add some background . i am arguing as a caucasian male of european descent , so i understand if people think that i 'm potentially out of the loop . it seems to me that having hiring quotas wo n't help with anti-discrimination . while you might hire more of a previously ' disadvantaged ' group , you are still discriminating against someone . example from life : the population is around half and half male and female . someone in hr in a large engineering firm therefore decided that the distribution of engineers should also be 50/50 . now while that sounds nice , the ratio in university was weighted about 70/30 men/women . in order to achieve the quota that had been set , men who had studied harder and performed better were being passed over in order to achieve these ridiculous hiring goals . now do n't get me wrong , there were fantastic female engineers who outperformed almost everyone and definitely deserved the jobs they got . there were also however the same ratio of slackers and idiots that were present amongst the guys . however most of those female slackers got jobs in preference to guys with higher scores and better ethics . now i know there are more reasons , e.g. the women may have interviewed better , or fit the team better , but on average i feel that these quotas have unfairly discriminated against men . now to the point . i do n't really care if most women do n't get jobs . i also do n't care if most men do n't get jobs . i only really care if i am being discriminated against . quotas to hire x number by ratio of [ insert minority here ] i feel can hurt my chances and are forms of negative discrimination . i 'm a supporter of having diverse workplaces . i just think that those should arise naturally rather than be forced . i 'll happily agree to blind interviews , where your resume does n't have a name or sex on , so the reviewer ca n't tell race or sex . but i do think that a quota for diversity adversely affects people and is ethically wrong . if i have n't expressed myself well i 'll try and clarify in the comments . also , sorry for any formatting problems as i 've done this on mobile .","so if an industry is dominated by white males , they are more likely to be biased towards hiring another white male . however , in my opinion the quota system is the worst solution to this problem , as it results in de-legitimizing the hire . for example , given that there are a certain number of women the company must hire , the successful candidate 's colleagues might think that she is only hired to fill that number , even if she is perfectly qualified for the job . this then perpetuates the problem of candidates of a certain sex or ethnicity being under-valued for their qualifications and accomplishments . one thing the quota system does well is that it ensures that someone from that group would definitely be hired . this is good for industries where there is little or no presentation of that group , as it shows the next generation of people belonging to the same group that the career option is possible and viable . someone had made this point already so i do n't dwell on it . however , in industries where those groups are already present ( although still under-represented ) , i think the quota system does more harm than good . studies have shown that group hiring results in better presentation of the diversity in the applicants . ( basically , you are less likely to hire 5 white guys out of 100 , than you are to hire 1 white guy out of 20 5 times . ) however this only works if there are multiple openings for similar positions at the same time . another way to ensure that candidates are not overlooked for their sex and / or ethnicity is to ensure that the shortlist of candidates reflects the general diversity of all the applicants . tldr : positive descrimination as you described is implemented to address an important problem in the hiring process . however , it is often the wrong solution for that problem . positive discrimination or affirmative action is usually only applied to a very small number of jobs in the job market . that means that members of the straight/white/male majority still have much better overall chances of getting all the other jobs that are out there . personally , i prefer the following compromise : apply positive discrimination only in cases where there the employer needs to choose between candidates of equal suitability . e.g. if the last 3 candidates for a job end up with the same interview scores after all rounds have finished , the hiring company should choose the person who would most improve diversity in their company . positive discrimination does not mean that nobody is discriminated against . rather , it means that everybody is discriminated against in favour of a single group — contrast with normal discrimination , where a single group is discriminated against in favour of all/most other groups . whoever claims otherwise is incorrect on the most basic level and likely misunderstands how positive discrimination aims to achieve its goals . tv studios have diversity programs which aim to put at least one minority in their writing rooms . however , these programs do n't end up discriminating , because the diversity hire does n't get paid out of the show 's budget , they get paid directly by the studio . with the program , the show hires x +1 writers for the same cost . nobody competing to be in the original x writers gets discriminated against , because they 're still competing for the same number of jobs , and the writer 's room becomes slightly more diverse . because when i was in engineering school the women , on average , generally out-performed the guys . women who go into engineering often have family connections to the profession and have been nurtured & mentored in that direction for years , and since it is a minority profession for women they often need to possess an extra bit of drive and desire to be there . it could for example be that , for whatever reason , women are more likely to perform well than they 're likely to get hired somewhere . in that case , the discrimination against the ostensibly better male candidate who wo n't get the job is justified , because it really fixes a problem with the hiring procedure that has no better known solution . hey fyi op , they did a study with blind interviews in australia and it backfired because they learned that they were more likely to hire women normally but they kept hiring men when they hired based on merits . it only “ backfired ” in the sense that the people conducting the experiment assumed they were discriminating against women before they did the study . for example , suppose society is tinted in favor of caucasian males , but we utilize programs like affirmative action to make it more favorable towards minority males . well , if it ever becomes too unfavorable for caucasian males and their outcomes grow worse than everyone else , then positive discrimination programs like affirmative action will start to help them , too . because almost all positive discrimination programs is only aimed at helping people in demographics that are doing poorly . so although caucasian males are doing quite well right now , if they ever get into a position where their outcomes are below everyone else , then these positive discrimination programs will help them too . ( i realize i am supposed to disagree in this sub so , idk , some groups need additional help and providing support to the severely mentally disabled , or those with physical disadvantages is not discriminating against the working class poor without these disabilities , instead it is a methoid of welfare which provides the advantage of fulfillment , independence and stability to those in need of help . i understand the word quota in this use as something that is a number that is required to be filled . i have not done hr work exactly , but i have worked in an hr department with their data . that outside company tells them that "" as per the population "" ( for the entire company statisics ) and the position statisics "" as per the people who apply vs hired "" you should try to hire 6 % more woman , or "" 3 % more people over age 40 "" that means that if 30 % of the engineers are woman , then only 30 % of those woman can apply . when they do n't exist to apply , and therefore do not apply - they are not expected to hire them . the company says "" we want to hire 6 % more women because we are not hiring the same percentage that applies "" ( this is a benchmark . then the company does outreach to , lets say , a women 's engineering group . all the company has to do is have the benchmark documented , and the outreach documented , and they have fulfilled the requirements of the eeoc . it matches directly with who has applied in it 's ratio . because it matches the natural ratio , no one is asking them to hire more females . positive discrimination is not just about having a diverse workplace . positive discrimination aims at tackling structural discrimination in a given society . you mention an example of the fundamental problem in your own explanation : there are 30 women for 70 men in stem studies ( i do n't know the exact ratio , but i think 30/70 is actually an overestimation of the number of women ) . or try to explain why women do n't choose or do n't succeed in that field . so , the aim of positive discrimination is to make it possible for women ( and you can replace women by any discriminated group ) to succeed in non-traditional fields , so that younger women can see it is in the realm of possibilities for them . what you lose by discriminating against a dominant group ( because you 're right , men are negatively discriminated by favouring women ) , you win for a greater good , striving for a more equal society ."
a0sh4w,"voldemort is a really bad analogy for hitler i see comparisons everywhere between voldemort and hitler . rowling herself has drawn comparisons between the two as well as between death eaters and the nazis . but i think this is a shallow comparison at best . as far as i can tell , the only real similarity between the two is that they 're both violently racist . but being racist is n't something only hitler did , obviously . nor is hitler the only person in all of history who attempted genocide . to summarize hitler 's story : he was a failed artist who fought in wwi . he later gained political prominence by giving speeches to anyone who would listen about the jews and how they were at fault for everything wrong in europe . he eventually got so popular with his people that he was appointed the head of the german workers ' party , got imprisoned after a failed coup , and from jail he wrote his memoir which drew even more of the population to his side . long after his release he was appointed chancellor of germany , and from there he orchestrated invasions of neighboring countries as well as mass imprisonment and slaughter of minorities , homosexuals , people with disabilities , etc . voldemort 's backstory starts him off as a "" mudblood "" orphan with sociopathic tendencies and a deep self-loathing for anyone not pureblooded . in hogwarts he was a model student who basically everyone loved while he secretly collected horcruxes and set up various plotlines for harry potter in the future . after graduating he disappears for years to learn evil magic and recruit like-minded followers , and comes back with an army of wizard cultists and sentient non-human creatures that had been dispossessed by the ministry of magic , igniting the "" first wizarding war "" . at the height of his reign of terror , he learned of the prophecy that foretold a baby would grow up to strike him down . he tries to kill the baby , but it backfires as foretold by huey lewis in his prophecy "" the power of love "" , and the rest is history . i do n't know about any of you , but the backstories and actions of hitler and voldemort to me seem highly dissimilar , to say the least . for one , voldemort is himself a "" jew "" , if we 're going to equate jews with wizards with muggles in their lineage . hitler was n't exactly an avatar of his ideal tall , blonde , handsome , blue-eyed aryan , but he definitely was n't jewish ( or at least that 's what all the sources i read say ) . further , hitler committed genocide from his position within the government . voldemort acted as basically a terrorist far outside the scope of legality , and as far as i 'm aware , hitler did n't lead groups of hooded figures door to door to kill jews before he became chancellor . everything hitler did , after all , was legal . to make voldemort a somewhat passable analogy for hitler , rowling should have had him work his way up through the ministry of magic and launched his anti-mudblood agenda from there where no one with authority could stop him . lastly , and probably most importantly , voldemort worked side-by-side with "" undesirables "" in the magic community in his war against the ministry . according to the harry potter wiki , his army was comprised of giants , goblins , werewolves , and other intelligent beasts who were easy to recruit because they hated the wizard community as well for how it treated them . this puts the ministry in an awkward position , because in this they are actually more similar to the third reich than voldemort 's cult is . they 're the ones who it turns out are supremacists of a kind because they did n't give rights to non-humans and classified them as beasts . one could say voldemort also hated non-humans , and he was probably using them as useful idiots to help him wage his war , but even that paints a wide line between him and hitler , who purged minorities from the ranks of his government . if they 're an analogy for anything , voldemort and his death eaters are a lot more similar to the kkk ; a fraternal organization/cult dedicated to preserving their "" race "" of purebloods , led by a veritable clayton bigsby . & #x200b ;","analogies are n't meant to be exact copies , and as such , jk rowling did n't seek to copy hitler exactly . you make some good points , but it all falls apart on the fact that nothing jk rowling writes is actually thought through . i would n't use ' great ' to describe any acts by them , but it might be better to say ' incredible ' ( although evil ) . this quote alone might have been made to draw a comparison to the most recent , harshest , world-known dictators : stalin , mussolini and most notably , hitler . you cover all the background stuff , but consider what voldemort and hitler did that was incredible . i cant recall voldemort 's accomplishments outside of forming an army , being as powerful as dumbledore ( or more powerful ) and creating horcruxes ( 6/7 no less ) , but killings aside , his acts were incredible , despite being evil ( horcrux requires killing , and using the rarest magical artifacts to create them ) . he took a war-torn , impoverished nation and returned it to a world power that may have very well taken over the entire damn world ! he took a country crippled by debt and managed to stimulate it to improve infrastructure , build an elite army and even take over other countries . seizing the property of all the jews only bolstered their riches and created a victim to blame for their shortcomings , which unified most of the germans ( not condoning it , just saying hate is a powerful unifier , however misguided ) . stalin had the same impressive track record , but he was an ally , not a bad guy ( the man was the man of the year for time magazine at one point ) , so hitler takes the brunt of it ( also the genocide thing ) . all this is to say that voldemort and hitler have a lot in common and hitler is the most recent "" bad guy "" that is notorious . there 's always going to be comparisons to be made between really bad people and why not take some inspiration from history ? while you are absolutely right , their backgrounds vary wildly , would n’t you agree that using voldemort as an analogy works better for peoples understanding ? the harry potter series is widely known and has an easy to understand plot . world war 2 is widely known but extremely complex , and is difficult for many - especially students - to understand . so why not allow for a temporary solution , let young students ( pre-high school-ish ) think of hitler as voldemort , as it ’s something most of them can relate to having read the books than relating to ww2 then , eventually we can wane the hitler-voldemort analogy , and talk more specifics in high school + . and besides , if using a voldemort analogy sacrifices historical accuracy , but lets students understand the second world war much easier , then i believe that it is a small sacrifice to make ."
a0s464,"i should be able to marry anyone , regardless of our relationship to each other , in order to allow them the benefits that a partner in a married relationship enjoys , in the usa . if marriage is about sex , and it is proven thus-heterosexual males only marry heterosexual females , heterosexual females only marry heterosexual males , homosexual males only marry homosexual males and homosexual females only marry homosexual females ( big side note here : of course , some hetero sexual males will be attracted to homosexual males and vice versa and the same for hetero and homosexual women ) it 's probably a good guess , close to 100 % , that if married people were n't or could n't be intimate , they would n't get or be married . and if most of my married friends are married and are not intimate with their spouses , then why ca n't i have a spouse and not be intimate and yet be married and offer my spouse the benefits of my passport or insurance coverage ? i 'm feeling an upwelling of love , but only for foreigners . i want to learn a new language and culture . let 's make love and then we can hate each other and hire lawyers and split our money . why let just the army , marines , navy and air force fight those across our borders ? i want to bring one into my fold and fight up close . we will loathe each other and not have sex . is that not marriage ? unfortunately , usa law states that we ca n't marry for the purpose of evading any provision of immigration law . heck , i want to embrace immigration law . my love ( though we have n't met yet ) does n't have a passport and i do ! do we really need to bring sex into the equation ? the way we love each other is between us . not between us and the government . why ca n't my best friend receive the benefits of my employer 's insurance . unfortunately my roommate and i are not gay and do n't want to get married . but why ca n't i bestow my work benefits to someone i 'm not married to ? if we got married , or had sex , my roommate could get my benefits . alas , i do n't want to sleep with everybody i just want us all to be better off . tldr-want to marry an immigrant or a friend so they get benefits but it seems illegal . > this is a footnote from the cmv moderators . we 'd like to remind you of a couple of things . firstly , please read through our rules . if you see a comment that has broken one , it is more effective to report it than downvote it . speaking of which , downvotes do n't change views ! any questions or concerns ? feel free to message us . happy cmving !","if this were the case , tax law and company policies would be less rewarding for married couples . employers provide benefits based on an algorithm of beneficiaries per employee . if all employees had beneficiaries because you could now give benefits to a friend , this ratio would change and the cost of benefits per employee would rise substantially . overall , the ability to insure a friend is not as important to most people as the ability to insure their so . most businesses are willing to offer certain limited perks with the idea that they are meeting a need that 's critical to their employees . every employee would take advantage of the ability to give their friend free insurance , and they would not cherish it as much as someone who is giving it to their so . considering that you can get divorced about as quickly as you can marry , what stops someone from setting up shop effectively printing marriage licences , green cards , and divorce certificates ? a green card is a highly demanded item and there are limited roads to it . marriage based immigration is effectively a loophole to this system but it works as a screening step of its used faithfully — presumably , an american who has “ american ” values marries someone who shares those values and is thus screened to be a productive american . while crude in implementation , the system is meant to provide these checks by preventing transactional relationships . as i see it there are four options : enable unlimited immigration through marriage and divorce , prohibit divorce thus limiting this loophole ’s scope and attractiveness , or demand that international paramours affirmatively validate their marriages and its nontransactional nature , end marriage based immigration ( many countries do not extend citizenship to spouses ) . but then governments believed they were sacred that deserved special protection meaning that borders or the justice system ca n't keep married people apart . just giving legal benefits to any two people who want legal benefits undermines what it the institution was designed for . if you want to actually get married to a really close and intimate friend who you do n't want to have sex with , it does n't look like there 's much in the fraud process that 'd weed you out . i 'm looking through a short and incomplete list of questions here , and it does n't look like any could n't be answered by a pair of really close friends who are actually married . i guess that , in summary , there 's really nothing stopping you from getting married to your roommate . if you do n't care about that , practically , if you could just get married to anyone to give them benefits employers would stop offering benefits . they do n't want to give out benefits to random people , they want male employees with spouses because its beneficial for them . traditionally , it was between a man and a women , and it was a life long commitment , and the benefit of that commitment was that is provided a good environment for child rearing . eventually we recognized that we should allow gay people to marry as well , and there are a variety of reason why . what you are saying , i think , is that marriage should not be a special relationship . but then you say the legal benefits should be given to any two people who agree to accept those benefits . if marriage is n't a special relationship , then we should dismiss all the legal benefits . and if you are exploiting it for other reasons , then you are doing something wrong and should be denied the benefits intended for families . assuming you want to be married to only one person ( at the time ) . i do believe that it would be better to love a person for its personality not for where they come from but you do you . are you under the impression that you have to have sex or be in romantic love with someone for a marriage to be legitimate ?"
a0r7ob,"palestine is in the wrong the israel-palestine conflict is very controversial to say the least . everyone seems to have a side , but to me the evidence points in favor of israel being a free state . i did have a few pre-conceived notions before research , so confirmation bias may be in there . however , here is my take . during world war i , britain promised both the jews and the arabs ottoman land . a few years after they won , britain realized they dropped the ball so they went to the united nations . when this happened , most of the former ottoman empire land was already controlled by arabs , and the jews wanted a homeland after the holocaust . as soon as the un gave israel statehood , five arab states tried to smother it . coming out on top , israel pushed the un borders a little , while jordan and egypt took what was remaining as their own . after this egypt stopped israeli ships by blockading them , which led to another war . after this , the six-day war ensued , where some 250,000 arab troops surrounded israel . they launched a surprise attach and regained much land . the land from jordan was minuscule as with syria , and they gave the entire sinai peninsula back to egypt for peace from a conflict that they did n’t even start . israel neighbors even attacked them in 1973 on atom kippur , the holiest day , which seems pretty inhumane to me . the palestinian movement in israel was met with many offers . several times was palestine offered a sovereign state , but they rejected . instead , they launched terrorist attacks against the israelis . arab states along with palestine seem to be mad for wars they themselves started . israel just wants to exist , and as a small strip of land it seems to be the underdog . it instead seems palestine tried to act like the underdog when in reality all they are objecting to is israelis making settlements , which is n’t a big deal . overall , israel seems to be in the right to me . palestine should have accepted the offers or arab states should have just let israel be .","the arabs were in control for centuries until after world war ii , and before them the hebrews were constantly under the control of other powers . you may be less familiar with the next line of it though ... in the 1920 's and 30 's the jewish population in the mandate increased exponentially with wealthy donors / international organizations buying up land reserved for jewish settlement . the constitution : it stated that with over 450,000 jews having now settled in the mandate , the balfour declaration about "" a national home for the jewish people "" had been met and called for an independent palestine established within 10 years , governed jointly by arabs and jews : this white paper was vehemently opposed by zionist groups which fought it with all means at their disposal - even terrorist acts ( most famously the bombing of the king david hotel ) . these efforts ended up being successful with the combined ( justified ) sympathy for the jewish people and british war exhaustion following ww2 . the british then referred the matter to the newly established un . looking at the partition plan drawn up by the un it is not surprising why the palestinians might have rejected it - they 'd be losing half their country and consigning 500,000 of their people to live in a foreign state . by presenting some of the historical background ( from largely the palestinian side ) i hope to have at least partly changed your view that it is as simple as "" palestine is in the wrong , israel in the right .

a0que2,"if you are socially liberal and fiscally conservative , and pick a socially conservative candidate , you are putting money over peoples rights . first off i think being fiscally conservative and socially liberal is a totally legit position , and sometimes the chance presents itself to support a candidate that espouses this view , which i of course very much support . however in an election that is between a socially liberal fiscally liberal candidate , and a socially conservative fiscally conservative candidate , choosing the conservative is wrong and selfish as you are placing more importance on your wallet than the rights of others . i find it unconscionable to endorse the stripping of lgbt rights and women 's rights to choose to get lower taxes and a more business friendly economy and do n't understand how someone who supports the liberal position on social issues would betray that in the interest of their fiscal conservativism","also if you are a libertarian , i am ... i often feel i have to choose the fiscal conservative ... because the fiscal liberals policies will destroy the nation , while a social conservatives policies will eventually be overruled by the people , regardless of the candidates ideas ( again : see gay marriage ) i think a major problem with your argument is that it does not acknowledge the synergy of fiscal conservatism and the protection of rights that social liberals are in favor of . as a practical matter governments ( both left and right leaning ) , regardless of the promises and claims made by the politicians who are in charge of them , are the greatest threat to citizens ' rights . almost all governments that end up becoming oppressive and violating their citizens fundamental rights do so based on good intentions and the belief that they are actually protecting their citizens . however , governments with limited powers , particularly when it comes to their ability to seize property and regulate citizens economic activity , are less able and therefore less likely to become oppressive than governments with unlimited power to take and redistribute property and regulate citizens ' economic activity . accordingly , a person who is fiscally conservative and socially liberal could reasonably calculate that while on the surface an economically and socially liberal government might intend to grant a wider array of rights in keeping with their beliefs a fiscally and socially conservative government is far less likely to be able to overreach in its actions and compromise the foundational freedoms on which many of the more socially liberal "" rights "" rest . if you believe the progressives in your area ( for instance ) are driving a train that is going to fly off a cliff financially , resulting in the destruction of pensions , massive job loss , and perhaps the total collapse of a city , etc , then i do n't think this is a conversation of "" putting your money "" over people 's rights as if someone 's voting a fiscally conservative candidate so they can save a few bucks on their taxes . a million people losing their jobs , or losing their retirement , death of a city , etc , has severe social penalties as well . i would n’t say that social conservatives are against anyone ’s rights , it seems like this is an exaggeration at least at the federal level , “ fiscal conservative ” is the policy of democrats . for example , current democratic candidates do not respect my rights to own guns . \ > as you are placing more importance on your wallet than the rights of others you 're placing more importance on everyones wallets than on everyones rights . how you decide to balance the rights at stake and the funds at stake make all the difference . i like all the rights , but we do n't have a political party who advocates for all the rights so we gots to pick and choose . the woman and the baby both have rights and there 's a balancing act to be done . i side with the woman generally , but i understand the opposing argument and those that have a problem with being forced to subsidize this activity . there is an argument that fiscal autonomy is more meaningful to people 's lives than any social rights . in a fiscally free and prosperous state , you are free to arrange your life how you please . in fact , many argue that a non-fiscally conservative govt is precisely how you give a govt the power and mechanisms to become repressive ( i.e. the road to serfdom ) . i vote conservative however , because i feel like the conservative social agenda is unlikely . i would argue that the fiscal conservative is almost always the safer bet for the following two reasons : a social conservative has little real power to strip rights from people due to the constitution and the various civil rights bills . i find the notion that they 're aggressively trying to strip away the rights of anyone that does n't fit their ideals to be largely exaggerated in practice as well . fiscal conservatism puts more power in the private sector which , while yes , can lead to some people denying service to certain groups , also puts those individuals in a worse economic standing as they 're choosing their morals over revenue . later , the same thing led to the passing of jim crow laws when the racist business owners appealed to the government to force their competition to stop serving black people . a free market is exactly the bastion where the prosecuted can find friends as there will always be someone that puts money over social stigma . in every candidate selection , some tradeoffs must occur , as with only 2 candidates in many races , you are often selecting the lesser of two evils . after all , my wallet is only one among many , just as my rights are one persons among many . judging the damage a given candidate will do to rights vs economy is ultimately a judgement call , and neither threat should be ignored . so this comes down to the details as some that would be defined most likely has "" independent "" or a "" libertarian "" many times i have to find the point that i wo n't change on when voting for a candidate . socially conservative candidates at the federal level are different from socially conservative candidates at the state level . a lot of libertarian leaning people will support socially conservative candidates for federal offices , and socially conservative federal judges , because they think that issues like gay marriage and abortion should be state issues . rather , it sends the issues back to the states , which is where a lot of libertarians think it belongs anyway . you could label it as "" you are putting ending poverty over people 's rights "" . likewise , i am a social liberal and monetary moderate , who cast a ballot liberal in any case . on the off chance that your conviction framework depends on the thoughts that singular opportunity and free markets bring remarkable human flourishing ( and there is a colossal measure of proof for this ) \ , at that point your choice would not be made with the end goal to profit , but instead you would put the prosperity and advancement of the general public over the prosperity of the privileges of some littler minority gatherings . for some financial traditionalists , this math looks at . along these lines you are not putting cash over individuals ' rights , yet rather the prosperity of the general public in general over the privileges of a some little gathering of individuals . the thing about social conservatives is that they do n't tend to wind back history . take same-sexed marriage for instance : social conservatives may not reckon that people of the same sex should get married ( for a myriad of legitimate reasons ) , but to reverse the new laws would mean to break up ( or annul ) a bunch of existing marriages . also even if a "" social conservative "" is willing to turn back history , you can be secure in the knowledge that that single person wo n't be enough to bring about a change in an issue you hold dear to you . you can support candidate bob as an mp in your state 's parliment ( australian here : do n't know how american state politics work ) for his policy on x , while disagreeing with his policy of y , if every other mp in parliment disagrees with his policy of y it does n't matter what his policy is if he ca n't get it through . some people might argue that affirmative rights exist ( ie those that have to be provided by others such as housing , education , and healthcare ) , and others may feel that only natural rights exists ( ie those that you would have if you were the only person on earth - free speech/expression , right to property , self defense , right to liberty ) . they may believe that keeping all of what you earn is a right and that any taxation is theft . they may also not care who can get married because they do n't see marriage as a right ( which it currently is n't for straight people either , hence the need for a marriage permit ) . they may also feel that their right to free expression gives them the right to discriminate against people based on their lifestyle . for example , it is reasonably likely a candidate could follow through on a tax cut , but it may be politically impossible to restrict the liberties of gays , so it does n't matter what their view on the thing that wo n't change is . i think you are setting up a False dichotomy ... or at least painting with broad strokes . socially liberal can simply mean , "" let homosexuals get married , geesh "" or "" decriminalize some drugs already . "" another , albeit different point is that fiscally conservative people are n't inherently focused primarily on their wallet . some fiscally conservative folks , when discussing social programs , are simply just as concerned with the ' how ' of a particular program as they are with the ' what ' , ' why ' , and ' for whom ' aspects of those programs . a socially liberal and fiscally conservative person , in its purest form , is basically a libertarian . to be honest when i do support conservatives it is usually because i know that they will never get their social agenda done . for example , as a rule of thumb , any candidate running for federal office saying that they support a same-sex marriage ban in the constitution and/or a full defund of women 's health services usually wo n't get that done . fiscal issues , however , have the best chance of actually getting action . for example in europe a few conservative parties are pro "" civil unions "" gay marrige in all but name while the more left wing party are literaly communists that would utterly wreck economy . yes if your countries conservatove party is racist homophobic and utterly insane like in the usa yoir point holds but its not universally like that . putting fiscal issues over social issues can just be an acknowledgment of your view of the rolo in government . like when i vote for president , i avoid the mistake that many people make on judging them on domestic policy , since presidents have relatively little power in terms of setting domestic agenda and most of their powers are in setting foreign policy . for example , libertarians are often considered socially liberal because they endorse things like legalization of all drugs and believe strongly in many other rights and freedoms . but they also have a particular vision of the government , which is to roll back the power of the federal government giving more power to state and other local governments , which is a typical republican platform . such a rollback of federal powers would allow for a more libertarian state as an option . i do n’t know if any candidate that is here to strip women or gays of their rights , and i believe the claim that these candidates are going to start removing rights from people is dishonest and fear mongering . nobody is picking money over rights because rights are not at stake , and this is a common scare tactic . fiscal conservatives ( i would call them economic liberals but that can be confusing for people not familiar with the policy meaning of the term ' liberal ' outside american politics ) do n't take their economic stance because they think liberal economic policy only benefits them , but because economically liberal policiea promote economic well-being for everyone in a society . provided non-economic individual freedoms are not trounced to too great a degree the benefits of economic liberalism can outweigh the costs of social illiberalism for society as a whole . gay marriage just is n't as pressing an issue in the face of food shortages because some well-meaning idiots thought price controls on grain would help poor people afford grain without affecting supply , or housing shortages becaise same said idiot thought rent-control would make housing more affordable also with no effect on supply of housing ( cheap housing by law does little good if there is n't enough housing being built ) . there are heirarchies of needs , fiscal conservatives worry about basic economic needs first . to read everything i ’ve said an come away with “ i ’d support trump even if he banned gay marriage ” shows how little time you actually spent looking into my point of view . i 've never heard any ( even extreme ) politician with a goal to reduce women 's rights . however when the economy is good it smooths over all sorts of bad things about the way we treat each other . i would argue that broke working class families had it a lot worse than them . unfortunately most conservatives are fiscally inconsistent with their talking points but we 're speaking in hypotheticals here . for example , the president has a great deal of power to influence fiscal policy through the powers of the executive branch . the president has relatively little power to influence social policy , as making a significant impact on issues like lgbt rights and abortion would in many cases require overturning a landmark judicial decision , or at least a significant piece of legislation . in choosing a presidential candidate , it makes sense to prioritize issues that they will actually end up dealing with . fiscal conservatism mainly stands for reducing deficits and spending , cutting subsidies , and increasing free trade at all costs . your claim the lgbt rights and women 's rights are being stripped from them is unsupported ( at least in the us ) . for women and lgbt people to lose their rights , the law would have to be rewritten , and even the most extreme examples of this ( say the law that women could face the death penalty for abortions ) have only been floated in a few states , and are generally a political tactic , and not of genuine intent . so i 'll assume start from the premise that you are referring to actual fiscal conservatives , not the republican party , and also that your claim about women and lgbt people losing their rights is unsupported . there are people who could lose their rights , but right now these are mostly undocumented immigrants . to the main point - in this case , if your belief system is based on the ideas that individual freedom and free markets bring unprecedented human prosperity ( and there is a huge amount of evidence for this ) \ , then your decision would not be made in order to make yourself more money , but rather you would be placing the well being and development of the society above the well being of the rights of some smaller minority groups . thereby you are not putting money over people 's rights , but rather the well being of the society as a whole over the rights of a some small group of people . also , i am a social liberal and fiscal conservative , who votes liberal nonetheless . say for instance the economy was in the toilet and the fiscally conservative candidate had a more coherent and convicing plan for how to solve it than the socially liberal candidate ? in that sense it is the most logical choice to pick the fiscally conservative candidate over the socially liberal one . the assumption here is that that people rights are suppressed by socially conservative candidates . i would never vote for socially conservative candidate if their agenda includes , say , forceful hospitalization and mental treatment for trans/gay people ."
a0qpnw,"people who claim to care about saving human lives are hypocrites if they do n't direct their energy towards curing aging i see it in the media all the time : politicians , pundits and talking heads all talking about how they care about saving lives . "" human lives are our number one priority "" they say . let me list a few examples , just to drive the point home how common this is . pro-life advocates argue that we should outlaw abortion to save people from dying before they are born gun control advocates argue that we should ban certain weapons from the population to prevent deaths from mass shootings opponents of the death penalty argue that human life is important to preserve , even if the human is a monster environmentalists argue we need to reduce our carbon emissions to prevent the death toll from climate change advocates for peace argue that war leads to the deaths of many human lives , and therefore we should prevent it people who give blood argue that the donation could save a human life , and therefore is worth it philanthropists who give to the developing world argue that we should save poor people from dying from preventable diseases and on , and on ... but here 's something i barely ever hear about : the actual number one cause of death in the world , old age . that 's right , when our bodies grow old they get brittle and eventually fall apart . it happens to about 90 % of people in the developed world , and about 2/3rds of people worldwide . look it up if you do n't believe me . given that the majority of deaths are caused by the natural aging process , you 'd think that this would be someone 's priority , right ? and no doubt , there are a few scientists working on the problem of how to prevent old age . however , it 's nothing compared to the number of people working on the problems i have listed above . you might be thinking , "" what do you mean , tons of scientists work on curing cancer , heart disease , alzhiemers etc. "" but that 's not the same thing as curing old age . i 'm talking about halting the natural aging process , not just curing the diseases that go along with it . a good doctor is trained to cure the cause of the disease if possible , and not just to ameliorate the symptoms . unfortunately , as for the case of aging , our society seems to be spending almost no resources into anti-aging research . if you do n't believe me , try finding the largest organizations in the world working on this problem , and then read how large their budget is . hell , if we diverted even 0.1 % of our military budget to the problem , i 'd bet we could more than triple our annual returns . so why did i call people in the title hypocrites ? because they claim to care about saving human lives . that 's what they say . take gun control advocates . i have seen people on the news ( obama ! ) literally crying so that they could get gun control . and that 's not to insult them . death is bad , and i understand that . but what i have never ever ever seen is someone on the news crying so that the government could put more money into researching aging . not once . so , yes , these people are hypocrites . they claim one thing and do another . they ignore the elephant in the room and go after the mouse . it 's obvious if you think about it , but almost no one does . change my view .","i would suggest you do your research on the aging process and how one might go about "" curing aging "" before critisizing scientists for not spending time , effort , and money pursuing something with very little evidence and payoff . until there 's a plausible theory to test , no scientist is going to want to spend half of their masters pursuing it . they 're only hypocrites if they believe in the possibility of curing aging . if someone does not believe that curing aging is possible , then concentrating on preserving current lives makes sense . even if curing aging is objectively possible , it would just make those people wrong , not hypocritical . that ’s like saying any medical researchers that do n’t research heart disease are hypocrites . even if heart disease is the number one cause of death , that does n’t mean we should n’t research in other medical areas . directing your energy towards curing aging is also impossible for many people . your average person does n’t have the knowledge , ability , or funding to cure aging . your average person can , however , advocate and vote for policies that do save lives , however . there are many ways to save and improve human lives beyond curing aging , and most people are better equipped for other methods of saving lives . age is not a sickness in itself and therefore does not need to be cured . and aging is not a problem , its wonderful , people need to die , not only for over population but for completion of their life cycle . for example , if we do n't reverse climate change , then it 's not just that a bunch of individual people will die ; all of society will be affected in some way . if that happens before we figure out how to solve aging , then solving aging becomes much , much harder . to use the death penalty as an example , the only thing we need to do in order to solve that is convince people that it 's a good idea to stop doing it , and get some legislation passed banning it . if i were to redirect my efforts to anti-aging , the first thing i 'd need to do is get some sort of degree , and i actually ca n't afford to do that . if it is , then for most of us , the best way to help the anti-aging effort is to get as many people as possible "" uplifted "" to the point where they could potentially make that one big , unexpected discovery . there are other issues that are just as impactful as curing aging . climate change is one ; if we cured aging tomorrow , it would n't matter if the consequences are that the planet becomes uninhabitable . if we discover a cure for aging , but only the ultra wealthy or powerful have access to it , that 's actually a bad thing . it should be enough that each person direct their energy toward at least one of them . now , let 's suppose a person is going to tackle one of the causes of death . however , cancer causes a lot more suffering than heart disease does . since cancer causes more suffering than heart disease , a person could be justified in focusing on cancer instead of heart disease even though heart disease kills more people . let 's suppose we have two causes of death : a and b. b causes more deaths than a , but a is easier to cure than b. b might even be impossible to cure , whereas there 's hope for curing a. where would a responsible person put their money ? but we 've already had some successes with cancer and heart disease . if we threw our money and energy into anti-aging technology , we could just be wasting that money when we could be spending that money on cancer and heart disease instead where there 's more hope of doing some good . so i 've offered multiple reasons for why there 's nothing hypocritical about being concerned about human life without putting all of one 's energy into a cure for aging . natural death after a long life is n't the same as dying early . and i also care about a functional economy , because without an economy you can not support any of the life saving activities that exist . there 's never going to be a cure for aging and that 's a good thing . if people did n't age then in a few years the world would be full of people that are alive but in bad health ."
a0q6fp,"Falsely accusing someone of rape should be against the law , with repercussions similar to that of people committing rape . Falsely accusing someone of rape is mentally debilitating , ruins social interactions from long friends or total strangers potentially forever , and in the worst case people go to jail for a long time for being Falsely accused . and in many cases people who are Falsely accusing others of rape get off with a slap on the wrist and a “ talking to ” with only a few very publicized cases actually leading to legal repercussion . and how is someone supposed to react after being accused of rape ? if they ’re defensive , people assume they ’re trying to bury what happened with lies . and if they do nothing , nobody ever knows what happened , and can potentially spread worse rumours , not to mention the fact that the person who Falsely accused them gets to live on and possibly even forget they ever said that . whereas the person who was accused has to live where many people see them as an awful person , and refuse to interact with them , even going as far as to warn others not to . people even develop the idea that maybe they did do something wrong and they did n’t know , and that it might happen again , so they ’re very weary of any potentially romantic situations , ruining their self confidence and possibly sending them into a deep depression .","if you 're not in support of False accusers getting the same punishment for every crime out there , why is rape special ? but i do agree with you that there should be some level of punishment for a False accuser beyond civil charges , or whatever the charge is for perjury or filing a False report . i think you should change your argument to people need to be punished more equally if it 's found that they knowingly or maliciously filed a False report of rape or sexual assault . going to court for libel or slander might empty their pocketbook , but what if they do n't have anything to award you damages from ? a criminal charge of malicious accusation ( just making that up ) that carries jail time , but with a commensurately high burden of proof , would probably curb the people who are truly horrible , while still giving reassurance to victims that just because they ca n't get a conviction , does n't mean they 'll go to jail themselves . no , because this would discourage reporting rape , and would criminalize True victims who can not prove their allegation . rape is a very hard charge to prove , as most cases come down to "" he said , she said "" . this is why externalities - such as dress , behavior , etc. - are used to help determine who is telling the truth . these have been attacked in recent years , because they inherently remove agency from a woman - as in , wearing tight clothing does not mean that the woman wants to have sex , and it especially does not mean that she does n't have the right to change her mind about sex between when she puts it on and when the two individuals are alone . the rate at which they happen is rather disputed , because it is difficult to distinguish between a False charge and a True charge where we do n't have sufficient evidence to convict . remember , convictions require evidence "" beyond a reasonable doubt , "" and in many situations a jury can reasonably doubt that the sex was not consensual . so knowing that , imagine that you are a woman who has been raped , perhaps by an acquaintance or a spouse , with no witnesses or evidence to show that it was not consensual . do you make a report , in the hopes that he will confess or that evidence might exist to prove he committed the crime , or to try and establish a pattern of behavior so that he wo n't get away with it in the future ( or even just for your own peace of mind ) ? or do you refrain from making a report , because you 'll probably be charged and/or convicted under the law against False rape charges ? on the whole , the fear of prosecution would reduce the number of rape allegations , both real ones and fake ones . violence against prostitutes and escorts is quite common , but those crimes are seldom reported , as the women are afraid of being prosecuted for their sex work instead of being taken seriously as a victim . there for it is very hard for someone to get jail time for a False accusations ( difficult not impossible ) most women who take their rape to trial get accused of lying about it . unfortunately i do n't think there is a way to stop people from Falsely accusing as there is no way to get people to stop raping it is first and foremost libel , or slander depending on how you make the claim . it is illegal to file a False police report . it is illegal to lie under oath if things get to trial . and there are any number of other criminal violations that you can make in giving a False accusation . it already is against the law to Falsely file a police report ."
a0q00q,"immigrants crossing the u.s. / mexican border , legally or illegally , should not be tear gassed , shot , or otherwise harmed . today i read an article in the washington post about a group of immigrants attempting to cross the u.s. / mexico border , only to be diverted using tear gas . many of these were women and children , some of whom were still in diapers . i was horrified . how could america stoop to a new low in xenophobia ? what really concerned me was the amount of americans supporting or even praising the attack . it seems so barbaric and unjust . i talked to my mom about it . i know we have some political differences , me being a gay atheist and her being a devout christian , but i did n’t expect her response here . she said that these immigrants were “ storming ” the border to illegally enter the country . she also said that i should check multiple sources , claiming that i got some facts wrong , including the amount of adult men in the group ( i never said there were n’t any , i simply said many were women and children ) . when i asked what would be there goal if they were to enter the country , she went off on a tangent about how it would be ridiculous for us the try to cross into canada illegally ( we both admire the north but are stuck in the south for now ) . i am under the belief that most of the immigrants coming into this country “ illegally ” are simply seeking asylum or do n’t have the ability to acquire proper visas . if an immigrant is seen without proper paperwork , they should be set aside briefly and checked for things such as wealth , ability to obtain visas , criminal record , and family connections in the united states . if everything works out fine , i believe they should be allowed to enter the country and begin a new life . while these thoughts in my head seem reasonable even if overly optimistic , obviously there are people who would disagree with me . i want to hear your thoughts on the issue , if you are for , against , or want to correct my beliefs . ( i ’ll add edit paragraphs below if more information or corrections are needed . ) thanks please also note that i wrote this more out of frustration then to rant about politics . i honestly did n’t expect this many responses , but i ’m thankful for the discussion . i am also in no position to be well educated in political affairs ( i ’m not old enough to vote ) so i take full responsibility for any facts i got wrong , including the violence that occurred before yesterday ’s incident . i ’m trying my best to keep an open mind and allow better opinions to replace flawed ones . i ’ll keep in mind that my opinion is n’t the only one out there , and discussion is how we sort out right , wrong , and everything in between .","sure , children obviously should n’t be exposed to tear gas , but it was their parents that brought them there ( many proved they did n’t care about their child when they used them as human shields to block rubber bullets , and bringing them to such a dangerous situation in the first place ) . over 90 % of the people who stormed the border were men . the migrants were storming the border wall and throwing rocks at border patrol officers . i 'd argue that tear gas , a nonlethal deterrent , is the absolute best course of action . the migrants were told not to rush the border wall . then after several round of negotiation , the us and the new mexican president reached a new temporary deal to keep the migrants in mexico while asylum claims are being reviewed . the new mexican president starts on december 1 , so the migrant train only has a few days to get to the us before the new deal goes into effect . that would mean automatic deportation if the migrants try to get to the us illegally , as their asylum claims within the us would not be valid . msnbc had a report today that said most of the migrants storming the border wall were men , not women and children . that 's reasonable , but that 's not a valid asylum claim . what would you say is the best course of action to use against a horde of people climbing your border fence while hundreds in the group are throwing rocks at you ? i 'll tell you what europe did ( eventually ) . they put up border fences , sealed off their borders ( i.e hungary , serbia , poland , etc ) , use nonlethal weapons like tear gas to disperse migrants , etc . its not different than what was done in europe , though i 'd argue those migrants had a more valid claim than the hondurans . that said , i think you would do yourself a great favor in choosing one or two alternative news sources in today 's polarized climate - so to at least understand the "" opposing side "" , if not to learn the truth . how do you define asylum and how does the law define it , what is the procedure to acquire a visa and what kind would be the proper procedure . just to make my position clear : i personally am not for open borders and came to this position really very recently when i started seeking out alternative news sources during the kavanaugh hearings . since then , my views on trump and a lot of policies have changed and it seems kinda crazy that it happened so fast once i became open to explore other sources of information . we 've turned tear gas on our own citizens when they 've rioted . the obama administration also tear gassed a mob at the border . we have told the caravaners and the mexican government we do not want these people in our country . i 'm just pointing out that many americans might ask what the caravaners are doing to change things at home , or is the entire country of honduras expected to be allowed to claim sanctuary in the us . storming a border and throwing rocks at the people working there is not the process . let 's say there are 700 million people on a boat offshore of los angeles . none of them have proper paperwork , are all dirt poor , have no identity documents or ability to obtain a visa , are all non-criminals , and all share a common ancestry from a cloistered group of americans in western nebraska . do you still believe they should be allowed to enter the country , begin a new life , and eventually become citizens ? the issue is a group of them tried to expedite that process by rushing through the mexican border and trying to rush through the us border as well . the united states is actually the best example of why you ca n’t allow unchecked immigration ( native americans ) and these people were attempting to enter the county unvetted by using a large amount of people to overwhelm security forces . no nation can allow that without putting their citizens in greater danger a group of people rushing a border is an act of war . full stop , it is intrinsically an aggressive attack in and of itself . add to that the fact that they were also throwing rock and bottles at border patrol agents and force was more than justified . in fact lethal force was more than justified and has been authorized by the president at the discretion of the border agents . the use of tear gas , a common crowd control weapon used by police in the us is not only an appropriate response to a rush on the border , it is a restrained response . they would have been fully within their rights to use live ammo in response to that attack . they have been processing asylum applications , but that had to stop when the border shut down because of the rush on the fence . so their actions not only got them gassed , it stopped those legitimately seeking asylum in the proper manner from doing so . they are also being deported by the mexican government who deem such an act to be illegal and renders them ineligible for asylum under mexican law . there were very few women and children in the group that rushed the fence , and most of the photos blanketing media show the canisters dozens of feet away from them at the bottom of the slope of the hill . you then have to discuss what seeking asylum means , who qualifies , etc . seeking asylum is a special form of immigration that is reserved for those fleeing death and persecution . economic migrants are not asylum seekers . they are normal immigrants and have to meet a higher standard of immigration than asylum seekers and the "" line "" that they have to wait in is longer . it shows that they have no respect for their fellow immigrants , or for the laws of the country they are attempting to join . i would argue this is not ok and there are other ways to help people in need separate from breaking laws . they disobeyed the mexican police and breached the physical fences . immigration hawks in the us are often mocked when they claim that their opponents want open borders . it 's said that nobody wants open borders , they just want sensible policy . if the answer is yes , you need some measure of border enforcement ; you need to have criteria for saying when and where a person can and ca n't enter and under what conditions they can stay . so if you want to prevent events like this , you need to ask yourself hard questions and manifest your answers in your policy preferences . you cant just give them a firm talking to and expect them to not try again thats just asinine , but i think your right about what force they used , if there are children you just shouldnt use gas , also just the sight of guns makes people more likely to listen just because of the threat of possibly being shot , they didnt have to gas them but i cant say i blame them that sunday ’s incident included women and children does not have any influence over the fact that 500 or so migrants fought past the mexican authorities and basically rushed the fence , hoping to violently force their way over and into the us . the us border patrol in the area states that some of the migrants threw stones at the agents , prompting the tear gas . this sounds less like a peaceful crossing and more like a riot to me , and a riot has to be brought under control quickly and safely . tear gas is a relatively safe way of doing that , and the us soldiers deployed to the area are n’t armed with firearms anyways . basically , the tear gas was n’t deployed because they were trying to cross illegally , but because they were doing so violently and dangerously . i agree with you that violence is not an appropriate response to a person crossing the border , but to refuse to use any sort of policing / order-maintaining force that which could be harmful when they are attempting to cross violently and/or forcefully would lead only to more danger , violence , and fighting . number one for my belief on this it 's not the fact that they illegally entered it 's the fact that they not only used force on us citizens that were trying to stop the chaos but openly also injured them aka picking up rocks and attacking them with then number two study showed that 90 % of them did n't have the credentials for an american visa are to seek asylum in america and in order for this to take effect you must at least suffer from one of five requirements , if 90 % could fit into on the list why let them in . also the way they did it could have openly caused rightful us citizens to be injured . there also has been a series of events leading to why the second they broke in we became hostile , like when the snatchers appeared ( immigrants that would steal other people 's children so they could use the child as a excuse to get in ) hope this evidence changes your mind . here 's the thing - i do n't think the public is every going to get a clear answer as to what happened . "" the mexican government said it had retaken control of the border crossing after nearly 500 migrants tried to cross the u.s. border “ in a violent manner , ” and vowed to immediately deport central americans who attempt to enter the united states illegally . "" its a great big god damned mess and thankfully nobody started shooting ... that 's about the most positive thing that can be said"
a0poac,"generally speaking , white western countries are more progressive on social issues than non-white countries are . i 've heard a lot of people talk about how racism , sexism , homophobia , colorism , etc. are big problems in majority white places like the united states , europe , canada , etc . this is True , i will not deny that . i also believe that we have a right to talk about these problems in these countries and brainstorm solutions to fix them . however , i have also noticed that among a few of these same people , there seems to be this prevailing belief that people in majority non-white places are better about these issues . as i will explain below , examining different regions of the world , i really do n't believe that this is the case . & #x200b ; latin america & #x200b ; given that i am latino , i feel probably the most comfortable pointing out the social flaws in latin america . for this reason , this section will probably be longer than the ones exploring social progressiveness in other regions . i 'll start out with the topic of racism . it is no secret that the us has deeply embedded issues of racism , i can not deny that people of color have it harder in the us than white people . that being said , i would argue the mentality in latin america is still far behind the us on the issue ( maybe with the exception of places like alabama or mississippi ) . in particular , there many many issues with the way indigenous and black people are treated in latin america . they are generally looked down upon by mestizo and caucasian latinos and anecdotally speaking , i can say that many of my relatives sadly do not have high opinions of these groups . as this huffington post article points out light skin is highly desired in latin america and as a result , many television networks and ads tend to show lighter skinned latinos that look closer to yanet garcia than someone who is indigenous or black . this article also points out racism against asians that exists in latin america . & #x200b ; latin america is also very male dominated in comparison to the united states . this bbc article illustrates some of the issues with machismo culture that persists in latin america , particularly the need men feel to protect women , to the point where jealous and possessiveness is acceptable behavior for men . it also touches upon the catcalling that prevalent in many latin american countries like cuba and mexico . and perhaps most strikingly , it points out that the three most dangerous cities for women to travel on public transportation are in latin america : bogota , mexico city , and lima . for a profile of one particular country , this wikipedia page discusses gender inequality in honduras , a very male-dominated nation . & #x200b ; finally , the vast majority of latin countries are not open about or accepting of homosexuality or other lgbt issues due to the machismo culture . it is True that a few countries argentina and uruguay have legalized same sex marriage , but even in these places , public displays of homosexuality is not warmly received in the same way it is in places like san francisco , toronto , or melbourne . as this cnn article points out latin america has some of the highest rates of violence against lgbt people . & #x200b ; there are some signs that latin america is moving in the right direction on social issues and it 's not backwards on everything , but even brazil , arguably the most progressive country in latin america has shown with the election of jair bolsonaro that it is susceptible to the same far right wing ideology that the us fell trap to . and even the most progressive latin american countries still perform worse on social progress than any of the scandinavian countries and most european countries . there is not a flourishing social justice movement in latin america like there is in europe , the us , canada , australia , etc . it is there , but ( at least from my experience ) it has not been widely embraced by the majority of latinos . & #x200b ; asia ( east asia , southeast asia and south asia ) & #x200b ; ethnic groups in asia are also known for being racist against other ethnic groups in asia . for example , the japanese , koreans , and chinese all hate each other , and have had a long history of wars against each other . indians and pakistanis also do not get along , neither do thai people or burmese . japan and south korea are both highly homogenous regions that are known to discriminate against outsiders . in japan , if you are not ethnically japanese , you can never truly be considered japanese and will always be treated like an outsider . myanmar is also committing horrific genocide against the rohingya minority . and let 's not get started on all the human rights abuses that china commits from imprisoning tibetan writers to detaining uyghurs . & #x200b ; asian countries are also known to be very male dominated . for example , india 's practice of sati ) and prevalence of rapes illustrate the immense societal pressures on indian women . 1 in 5 chinese women also reported that they experienced domestic violence within the last year . even buddhism itself has also been accused of sexism . & #x200b ; and i ca n't think of any asian countries that allow for same sex marriage . taiwan came close to passing it lately , but unfortunately , the measure was rejected by voters . & #x200b ; middle east & #x200b ; first off , i 'm going to start off by saying that i know the topic of sexism and islam is a sensitive one . i was once an edgelord atheist who denounced all religion , including my family 's religion ( catholicism ) , as sexist and i can now see that the issue is not as black and white . i also strongly support the idea of freedom of religion , and i believe the people should not be judged based on their religion , but on an individual basis . & #x200b ; that being said , i think it would be very incorrect to say that sexism does not prevail in various islamic cultures . the obvious example would be women not being able to drive in saudi arabia until very recently . in iran , women are required to wear hijabs , or they could be punished by the religious police . this article also mentions that the majority of men in the middle east believe that a "" woman 's place "" is in the home . & #x200b ; racism also exists in the middle east . iran and iraq hate each other . iran and saudi arabia hate each other . israel and palestine hate each other . saddam hussein used banned chemical weapons against the kurds . gulf countries like uae and qatar constantly mistreat migrant workers . & #x200b ; and let 's not pretend it 's easy to be gay in the middle east . several middle eastern countries use the death penalty for homosexuality . & #x200b ; africa & #x200b ; even africa is not immune from racism , as illustrated by the rwandan genocide , the darfur genocide , and the deportation of arabs in niger . & #x200b ; female genital mutilation is also very prevalent in africa and countries like nigeria has various issues with sexism . & #x200b ; this wikipedia page on lgbt rights in africa also points out that > with the exception of south africa and cape verde , lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender ( lgbt ) rights in africa are very limited in comparison to many other areas of the world . & #x200b ; ok , i know i 'm being really cursory with the africa analysis and it 's probably not fair , but i 'm getting really tired so i want to wrap this up . & #x200b ; in summary , i do n't believe that majority white countries are always correct when it comes to social issues . when you look at history , white countries do have a lot of blood on their hands and i do think that white people need to acknowledge that they have not always treated nonwhite people fairly . i do think it is fair to call out white countries when they do not uphold values of human liberty and equality . & #x200b ; i also think it 's important to point out that white countries are n't more progressive on social issues because they are majority white and other countries are n't . rather , i believe a lot of it is due to the wealth that these countries have in comparison to most other countries . & #x200b ; that being said , i very much get tired of some social justice types constantly trying to cast nonwhite people as these angelic beings that are incapable of hate or discrimination . as i 've shown above , that is clearly not the case . and i believe it is very naive to believe that other region of the world are more progressive in terms of social equality than europe , the us , canada , australia , new zealand , etc . in this day and age , it mostly white countries that fair the best on the social progress index . & #x200b ; & #x200b ;","that being said , very few people "" try [ ... ] to cast nonwhite people as these angelic beings that are incapable of hate or discrimination . "" i do n't think there is a single serious progressive who will say all nonwhite people are perfect . ^ ^ ( if you can link to any public figure i would consider progressive that has said anything to the suit of "" non-white people are perfect "" i 'll concede that it is only most , but as it stands i 'm pretty confident on not a single person . ) in canada , indigenous children were forcibly removed from their parents and sent to residential schools , which were meant to assimilate these kids into anglo-canadian culture . india has a cultural term for intersex and trans people , who live openly in self-identified communities . instead , i 'm pointing out that -- especially when you 're being discriminated against in certain ways -- the experience of your marginalized group in another country might start to look appealing . ( or , to put it more concretely , if you 're a young woman who desperately wants to be a doctor in 1950s america , you might start thinking , "" man , those soviet girls are so lucky ! "" for one , you 're using the western standard as progressive , so of course western countries will stack up well ."
a0olkd,"bigots should be ostracized because convincing them not to be hateful with facts does n’t work most of the time . to be honest , i can see both sides of the argument here and i go back and forth . on one hand , most of the “ success ” stories of bigots learning not to hate a certain type of person are usually due to interactions with that type of person , which places the labor on the victim for rehabilitating these people . on the other , the vast majority of bigots are committed , and nothing will change them except maybe being cut off from “ polite ” society . so what ’s the right move ? do we try to teach bigots ? cut them out of our lives ? and is that answer different if you are the victim of bigotry ? tldr : bigots gone bigot and ostracizing them is the only way to keep bigotry in check . eta : i 'm defining "" bigot "" as someone who holds views of a group or groups of people which are/have been traditionally harmful to that group of people . in this discussion , "" bigotry "" requires harm and is n't just simple "" intolerance "" of a group . example : i think flat earthers are idiots . i 'm not particularly "" tolerant "" of their beliefs , meaning i 'm not going to debate something which basic science refutes . but , they are n't hurting me with their belief , and because of that , i do n't feel any hate towards them , nor am i intolerant of them as a whole person .","not so much that it would be an unethical burden on the victims but that by design it would be difficult to establish some kind of educational authority with someone who is bigoted . especially if we assume that that this work will be done by those who are the object of that bigotry . bigotry has a variety of causes , and the best approach for an individual bigot will depend highly on the specific factors that made them a bigot . i can tell you when other redditors have called me a ' bigot ' for any number of reasons related to political stances , i simply write them off as self righteous jerks . people would do far better to stop calling other people bigots ( or racists or insert name here ) and instead get to know them . i firmly believe most people in this world in real life are decent human beings and will be decent to other human beings . if you take a bigot out of the group , and provide concerted support , you can change minds . well i think people who disagree with should be ostracized . if you think they lack the capacity to change , that sounds like it makes more of a case for sympathy than isolation , but that is probably a different topic . if i grant your assumptions and we are speaking purely practically , do you think it is more dangerous keep the bigots close and tolerate their bigotry , or to push all the bigots out and isolate them ? at the end of the day a lot of these dudes were just raised being told x person is y , and never interacted with people from those groups before . i disagree with what you 're saying , because many people who you would describe as bigots may not realize they are bigots based on your definition . i have a friend who holds some negative views about a certain group of people . he accepted these views because it was what he was taught to believe . he lives in a place without people of this certain group , so he never had to challenge his belief . eventually he went to college , and was face to face with people of this certain group . he was scared , he thought they would hurt him , but he soon learned that they thought the same of him . they came from their group , and they learned that people from his group had the same negative views . my friend was n't dealing with someone of a different race , he was dealing with southerners . he thought they were all idiot hicks who inbred and spit chewing tobacco . the people he met thought he was a going to be a stuffy northern rich kid who would n't give them the time of day , and would get them expelled with his family 's money . people learn bigotry from their role models or parents , and those people learn it from the same set of people . what you 're asking for will result in bigots shaming other bigots who in turn shame those bigots in a cycle of bigot shaming . in some regions there is a certain group that cause the mass majority issues . convincing one to ignore one set of facts while accepting another is always hard ."

a0npl4,"words should serve to promote communication . when word choice makes meaning unclear , it hinders the purpose of language and should be changed . language is the means by which humans transfer knowledge and information . as such , the only purpose of language is to communicate ideas . within society , many of us become married to the jargon of our ideals . "" conservative "" . "" liberal "" . "" feminist "" . "" patriarchy "" . "" common sense "" . "" equality "" . "" fair "" . "" intersectional "" . "" pro-life "" . pro-choice "" . within a group , that jargon can serve a purpose . that said , in general discussion , these words often mean different things to different people , and language choice often results in a different message being heard than was meant . when words convey the wrong meaning in this way , they fail in their sole purpose . at this point , definitions are n't very relevant . words are subservient to the idea they transmit , and the accurate transmission of the idea is far more important than any jargon term or identity . because of this , any real effort to communicate should involve the speaker actively making efforts to avoid ambiguity in meaning or interpretation , and each side actively seeking clarification to prevent miscommunication .","i do n’t think anyone disagrees that defining terms is a good idea in mixed company . even using the word ‘ pint ’ is tricky because you ’d be referring to different volumes in the us and uk . you could communicate most of what ’s needed in english , but something would still be missing . that ’s this amorphous socially constructed goop that fills words alongside meaning . on some level , to properly communicate with these english speaking italians , you ’d have to understand italian . similarly , two people with very different definitions of feminism could effectively communicate by defining terms . however , if you really wanted to understand the other person , you ’d have to understand their jargon and where it comes from on a deeper level . take "" feminist "" , it does mean different things to different people - how would you express the same idea less ambiguously in one of those instances ? finally , using a word a certain way can be a way to affect change in how people think about an issue . poetry , prose , other artistic works could almost always be expressed more concisely and clearly than they are , yet we get satisfaction from these works not because of their brevity , but because they invoke emotion from us . and this emotion and beauty is often a funciton of the ambiguity of the language used , leaving conclusions for the reader to draw rather than explicitly stating them . this is far from the utilitarian view of language you express . a lot of the terms you ’ve listed here are n’t terms without meaning , though ... they ’re terms with vague meanings . like , if someone calls themselves a feminist ( or includes it in their twitter bio ) , you ’re likely to be able to guess to a certain extent what sorts of things they care about in a broad sense of the term . it seems to me that your issue is n’t necessarily with words themselves — as that ’s a whole debate about linguistics that does n’t have to do with politics necessarily — but rather with people ’s tendency to focus too much on broad abstractions and ambiguous labels . i agree with you , though , that these concepts have limited utility in the real world . ambiguity is an important part of language and is actually considered a feature in many languages . its useful in all kinds of contexts , such as using a double meaning of a word to make a joke , to tell a story with a purposefully ambiguous ending , or when you do n't want to describe how you feel about a particular subject because you know it 'll cause a political fight at the thanksgiving dinner table , so you say something ambiguous in answer to a question to avoid the topic . there are ambiguities or lack of ambiguities built right into language . for example , in english , you must specify a tense when saying an action word which implies when that action happened ( past tense , future tense , etc. ) . an opposite example called "" evidentiality "" is expressing how you know something , which in english you can be ambiguous about , but in other languages you must pick a form of the word that either implies you saw it first hand , you heard it , you inferred it , etc ."
a0njx0,"self defense is a human right , and therefore ownership of weapons is also a human right . obviously i 'm talking about guns here , but only in the abstract . ignoring all of the "" defense against tyranny "" and so on arguments for and against gun control , and boiling it down to the absolute most basic units : if someone is trying to kill me , i have the right to stop them from doing so . if stopping them involves their injury or death , that is sad but does n't change my rights . therefore , if self defense is a human right , shouldnt use and ownership of the most efficient tools of self defense follow as a right ? if free expression is a right , then is n't removing instruments of expression a removal of that right ?","self defence is a legal defence to a number of criminal charges from assault to murder . guns are legal for self defence , but also for sport . i.e. if you have time to get , and load your gun and assess the situation to know you need to shoot someone , you will almost certainly have time to use less lethal means to defend yourself . so we already have a small circumstances in which private use of a gun in self defence will be legal . guns get stolen , a lot , and they are always stolen by criminals , this article says 34 times more innocent people are killed by guns than in self defence . if you loosen the rules on how to keep guns , you make them easier to steal , or be used in error . i think the circumstances in which a gun will be lawfully used against another person , are far fewer than those in which they will be used illegally . i do n't at all feel worried that a will not be able to defend myself unless i had a gun , as there are just so fewer people with guns here . and when criminals are caught , it 's easier to seize their guns and harder for them to replace them . despite the most lax gun laws and high gun ownership in the industrialized world the us has frightening levels of gun violence making gun ownership easier will oy make that worse . that function is for shooting quickly at multiple easy to hit targets . let 's continue with your analogy of removing tools of free expression . there has to be a compromise that is n't derived directly from the ideal . but if you look at the ideal of free expression alone , it does n't have enough nuance to make this distinction . if everything could be derived from the ideal , we would n't need a political system , just refer to the ideal and the answer is clear . so if that advanced weaponry is off the table , then you have to agree some type of compromise is reasonable . excluding , therefore , someone trying to commit any other crime against you or your property . bearing in mind that the other person has the same access to guns you do , and will know of their intent to kill you before you will . which means you 're hamstrung , you ca n't act until you know they intend to kill you and your indication of that is probably an active attempt on your life . so the cases where a gun provides you more self-defense than a knife or just running like hell are pretty narrow . to wit : your free expression is limited by my right to privacy where the government prohibits you from divulging certain personal information about me . your free expression is limited by my right against defamation . excluding defense of property and cases where self-defense was premised on a perceived threat ( i.e. someone breaks into your house and you do n't know what they 're going to do ) the cases where a gun would specifically allow you to stop someone who is "" trying to kill you "" are pretty narrow . throw in the collateral damage you cause with guns ( i.e. you shoot someone else while trying to defend yourself , or overpenetrate your target and shoot someone behind them ) , and the collateral damage from guns being ubiquitous , and the cases where you could use a gun to stop someone who "" is trying to kill you "" are outweighed by the number of times someone dies due to a gun where no person was trying to kill someone else . if we ignore collateral damage , "" the most efficient "" tool of self-defense would be a nuclear weapon attached to a heartbeat monitor which will detonate in your city at the moment your heart stops . gun control does not mean the stripping of all weapons from every man . when i asked him what the point of an unloaded gun was , he said “ if you break into my house and i put a shotgun in your face , i ’m sure that you ’re not going to stick around to see if it ’s loaded or not . ” the rage of human beings has been blown out of proportion and the actions that i think should be taken is to not completely withdraw but to place a level of restriction or limitation towards the approach of use of tools to aid self defense . you have freedom of expression but not access to every single possible method of expression - you can not start using loud speakers outside my home in the middle of night . and if you break any rules , they can take away your license . your human right is to live and in order to live , you must defend yourself . that does n't mean defending yourself should be a human right . suppose sufficient proof is provided , and you can imagine that proof to be anything you want in any form you want , that guns are not that effective as a means of protection in general , that guns increase violence , that owning guns makes it more likely you are to shoot yourself or someone close to you . if those are the facts , and we suppose that self-defense is a human right , then it is consistent then that guns are banned . for the second point , lets imagine that guns are legal , but they can be made safer by forcing all owners to do a number of things like register their weapons , attend training , undergo psych evaluations , buy insurance , etc . if it is safer for these rules to exist for everyone , then you will have to agree that the government can put sufficient limits on ownership if these requirements are not met . in both examples , if the underlying goal is self-preservation through increased safety , then guns should be either banned or limited . if i was defending myself , even just walking around on black friday being a law abiding citizen carrying a gun legally it just being alive in my home with the front door locked . the right to defend yourself means that you have a right to act in a way to protect yourself from immediate harm . this means that if someone attacks me , and i kill them in defending myself , that defense will be considered in relation to their death . in theory , i should not be punished for defending myself . this is not the same as saying "" everyone has the right to equip themselves to best defend themselves "" . that is a sort of ' open loop ' of logic , because the better i equip myself to defend myself , the more threat i pose to those around me . so they need to equip themselves with tools ( aka weapons ) to defend themselves and things spiral . we would n't think that this argument would justify , say , ownership of nuclear weapons . so clearly there 's some kind of sliding scale , and the more dangerous the weapon we consider , the more tightly controlled it needs to be . to compare it to the free speech analogy , it does indeed infringe upon this right to deny people access to expression . to the extent self defense is a human right it is based on the superior human right to be free from violence . so if freedom from violence can best be achieved by limiting access to weapons then limiting access to weapons is consistent with protecting human rights even if it might hinder the ability to engage in self defense as self defense is a conditional right that is only operative when your right to be free from violence has been compromised . and i think there is lots of research showing that limiting access to weapons is a more effective means of ensuring that its citizens remain free from violence than providing unrestricted access to weapons . i think if you go along with the analogy of free speech being equal to self defence you can think of weapons being like megaphones . for me at least this is how i view weapons , everyone having a gun puts everyone on a level playing field in terms of self defence , but it would be nicer if no one , not you or the person potentially attacking you had a gun . we agree that you can defend yourself with a basic tool , like a stick . we can also hopefully agree that you should n't be able to defend yourself with nuclear grade weapons . so if there exists a point where weapons are justified , and another point where weapons not necessary , there should exist a point "" in the middle "" where there 's a point of inflection . even if you did have the right to self defense , that does n't makes the ownership of tools that help you with it a right . my idea : if someone is not eligible to hold a driver 's license , they should not be eligible thi own a gun . "" the ability to drive is a human right , and therefore ownership of tanks is also a human right "" . it isnt a perfect analogy but my basic point is that human rights , although fundamental , are n't applicable in every form or interpretation by default . you can say that the analogy is different in that tanks would ruin roads , increase traffic , take up more space etc so the cost to the public and society is the reason you ca n't drive a tank on public roads . the thing is that , whether or not you 're pro gun control , allowing guns into society absolutely has costs associated with it too . i 'm general , human rights have to be further specified and appropriated to fit society based on what is rational and what makes sense in a cost vs benefit analysis . most people would say freedom of speech and freedom to protest are also human rights but even that also has limits and rules . in most countries you are n't allowed to just hold a controversial protest without notifying authorities and you also ca n't express your views and opinions in ways that might cause public harm or panic . freedom of speech , freedom of religion , these kinds of things are human rights . you can say its related to your right to defend yourself , but owning a gun in of itself is not a human right ."

a0lzn1,"nationalism is not inherently negative french president emmanual macron recently condemned nationalism in a speech , and it raised some questions for me about the pros and cons of nationalism . here is what he said : “ nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism , ” macron said . “ by saying , ‘ our interests first , who cares about the others , ’ we erase what a nation holds dearest , what gives it life , what gives it grace and what is essential : its moral values . ” so i get that promoting national superiority is bad and sometimes dangerous , but i feel like that 's not what nationalism is . is n't nationalism just patriotic feelings , principles , or efforts ( at least in theory ) ? sometimes it 's gotten worse , like in fascist regimes and such , but that does n't mean it 's always bad . i guess this debate comes down to the definition of nationalism . i think there 's an implication in macron 's words that nationalism is defined by the regimes that identified themselves as nationalists , while i 'm partial to the literal definition .","seriously , most historians i know ca n't think of a single time when nationalism became a major priority and/or basis for a regime where it did n't result in serious negative consequences . it really does come down to definitions , for example i 'd say nationalism is not the same as patriotism - nationalism goes beyond patriotism , or love of your country and countrymen , and extends into belief in superiority - at best leading to ignoring things done better elsewhere as you already believe you 're better . viewing patriotism and nationalism as synonyms i can see why you might think the latter is fine , but that 's never really the implications and idea of it people criticizing it have . it seems that you already changed your mind , but for some more context , i assume macron 's tweet and definition of nationalism and patriotism is inspired by a quote from charles de gaulle nationalism is a belief , lacking rationality , that one 's home country is better or more deserving than other nations . - patriotism is similar insofar as it emphasizes strong feelings for one ’s country , but it does not necessarily imply an attitude of superiority . - sectionalism resembles nationalism in its suggestion of a geopolitical group pursuing its self-interest , but the group in question is usually smaller than an entire nation . - jingoism closely resembles nationalism in suggesting feelings of cultural superiority , but unlike nationalism , it always implies military aggressiveness . - based on the above definition is the sense of superiority that nationalism has compared to patriotism nationalism has been an important driver in independence movements , such as the greek revolution , the irish revolution , and the zionist movement that created modern israel . - so True , examples of nationalism created israel but i would argue , overall , nationalistic outcomes are inherently negative based on the definition of a view of a nation as superior . [ 120 ] generally , the most common way of classifying nationalism has been to describe movements as having either "" civic "" or "" ethnic "" nationalist characteristics . this distinction was popularized in the 1950s by hans kohn who described "" civic "" nationalism as "" western "" and more democratic while depicting "" ethnic "" nationalism as "" eastern "" and undemocratic . [ 121 ] since the 1980s , however , scholars of nationalism have pointed out numerous flaws in this rigid division and proposed more specific classifications and numerous varieties . - based on the various types of nationalism , i feel you will have to narrow your statement to include a specific type of nationalism and definition of how a nation is practicing nationalism ."

this ultimately has nothing to do with sex as we will undoubtedly have a first husband one day . so , in exchange for giving up their life , we give them the ability to have projects that they can work on and hopefully improve the country while they are living in the washington prison . she also typically acts as a bit of charitable figure for an issue of her choice and does some stuff for non-divisive political issues like children 's hospitals or whatever - which is arguably a good thing and makes the role more modern as the women arent only just the presidents-wife as they have their own thing going on . a dutch politician who took their spouse along frequently campaigning was heavily criticized on this with people sarcastically calling the spouse their "" first lady "" feeling that such theatrics were americanized and unbecoming of dutch politics . there 's no rule that the first lady has to be the president 's wife or even a relative . if michelle obama wins the presidency she can appoint martha stewart her first lady ( or snoop her first gentleman ) . the sexist thing comes much earlier : a man who wins the presidency usually wins in large part because his wife is good at that stuff ( trump , as always , is an exception ) . a wife who knows great photo-ops and event management is a key asset that helps men get elected in the first place . that has nothing to do with the first lady , and eliminating the office would n't change the fact that mostly people married to people who are good at that stuff are going to win ( and that most people good at that stuff who are happy to just use their talents to help their spouse and go back in forth between spotlight and background as needed to help their spouse are going to be women ) . the first lady also has access to powerful people and so has a somewhat unique ability to do good . basically the first lady can do whatever she wants , and she often chooses some form of work to make the wold a better place . the first lady is not in the line of succession to take over as president . if you are married to the president you get access to powerful people as a result of that personal relationship . but its not exactly nepotism because the first lady does n't get a job . i can not name the leader of brazil and i do n't know what country angela merkel rules . although it might happen from time to time , especially when a group of people walks single file to a speech podium or alike . the first lady can be discussed in the same way people discuss celebrates . the first lady does n't enforce the idea of a traditional family , our voting patterns do . why would it be wrong for the presidential family to publish photos of their family just because they are a man-woman-kids family ? it would be really wrong for the president to pretend that he 's something that he 's not in order to appeal to the minorities . i am all for treating everyone equally , but demonizing traditional families in order to make lgbt + people feel more comfortable is not ok . we have had only a handful of presidents since gay marriage/relationships have become more accepted so even by pure chance it makes sense that there have only been traditional presidential families since then . i do n't think the media attention will end , regardless of what official attention we give the term . i suggest that these , however , are merely an indication that the position ought to change , not be removed altogether . we already have buchanan to demonstrate that the sixty year old bachelor is n't too badly off with the present state of things , and i 'd imagine that if we had a president with a male spouse , some of those changes would happen automatically . reason 1 - first lady is just a nickname , not any kind of formal title with any official powers , so there 's nothing dynastic about it . reason 2 - there 's no nepotism because it 's purely voluntary self-employment . of course i know of michele obama and melania trump , but their sex has nothing to do with it . it 's not sexist , it just happens that more men are elected at this point in time so there are more first ladies than first men studies have shown that two parent households raise better children , and it has been proven that people in long term relationships live better healthier lives that last longer on average . while , yes to some extent the office of the first lady is a bit nepotistic , does to some extent cast women as subservient , and does reinforce traditional family role ( though those last two are mostly because we 've only had straight male presidents ) , that does n't mean that we should get rid of it . the fact that the first spouse ( so far first ladies ) are married to someone so powerful means that they are going to wield some form of power regardless if they are given a formal position/recognition or not . this is evident in the fact that first ladies have been active and influential since martha washington , even though there was nothing in place including them as a formal part of government . doing away with the formal recognition of this power ( even if their power is largely ceremonial ) would only put the actions of the office into a less prestigious and less observed position . in short , unless you 're proposing that all presidents must be single , separated , or get a divorce upon inauguration , the first spouse is here to stay ."
a0j00w,"the ideal way to enact a carbon tax is via a carbon tax dividend paid directly back to the people . after the release of a report by the white house last week , there has been a lot of talk about climate change , and how to best address it . one of the ways that is discussed is implementing a carbon tax that would be levied on sources of carbon emissions . simply levying a tax on carbon is the wrong move in my opinion . it would be incredibly regressive , and depending on how that tax money is spent by the government , could lead to lots of wasted money and/or projects that are borderline corruption . i think the best way to implement a carbon tax is to ensure that the government does n't spend any of the tax money that is collected - instead , the government should distribute the carbon tax back to the citizens and legal residents of the country in the form of monthly dividend payments , minus administrative costs . every month you would receive a check ( or direct deposit ) that would be from the carbon taxes collected the previous period . regardless of your income you would receive this money , and what you do with it is up to you . this curbs carbon emissions in two ways : it discourages carbon use because it is now more expensive for the end consumer . filling up your f-350 every week is going to cost you a lot more money than it would have if there were no carbon tax . and it also provides a positive incentive to consumers because they will be financially rewarded by choosing carbon-neutral or green activities . sure , you could use that carbon tax dividend to offset ( some of ) the costs of fueling your f-350 , but the math will never work out in your favor . you would be financially better off selling your f-350 and buying a used car that gets 30 mpg , or even better , an electric vehicle . in addition , this method also removes the regressiveness of the carbon tax .","the problem with any carbon tax is that the company 's are just gon na move , primarily to china , where they can pollute all they want and can pay their workers penny 's . i do n't understand how giving the money right back to people who are going to spend it on more stuff does anything . over 80 % of the worlds energy production comes from fossil fuels . sure , it negatively reinforces people to cut their carbon activity by levying a tax . if dividends are distributed based on current carbon use , where people get more for less consumption , then you need a new bureaucracy to measure carbon consumption of individuals -- not easy to do . nah , the best use of carbon taxes are to reinvest it in research , support regulatory efforts on corporations , and fund large-scale climate relief efforts or even geoengineering projects . if the tax is regressive ( i do n't think it is ) and you distribute the money evenly to everyone , then its still a regressive tax . so we 'd be in effect raising taxes on any industrial business . its usually wealthy people who own stock , so you 're raising a tax on them . your putting money into people 's pocket whenever carbon is emitted . i would suggest that instead of paying the tax back to the general population we instead use it to fund efforts to battle climate change . spend it on green energy subsidies , or projects aiming to re-capture and store carbon in the air . i believe that we should use that money to extract carbon out of our atmosphere ."
a0f0i3,"anthropogenic climate change is real , and we have a clear moral imperative to reverse it as quickly as possible i will say from the start , i believe anthropogenic climate change ( acc ) is real , and is perhaps the most important problem we face as a global community . i struggle with the debate over this because a lot of arguments from sseem not to be made in good faith . the arguments against acc being real tend to be : - scientists studying climate change are in some way biased or corrupted . they will say scientists are funded by the government , and the government somehow has an interest in acc being real ( perhaps funding acc reversal would put more money in the coffers of government , or the scientists that study it have a financial stake in acc being real , because if it was not , they would n't have anything to study ? ) - the climate is naturally cyclical and this upward swing will be countered by a downward swing sometime later . with regard to the first point , scientists are indeed funded by the government , but their funding would persist even if acc i was real . they 're just paid to study the climate , and the climate appears to be changing , due to the influence of humans and industry . for the second , i 'm not expert , but simply looking at graphs of the carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere over thousands of years ( thanks to date from ice cores ) seems to strongly suggest that industry has made an enormous difference . there 's another argument that people who believe the scientists are just trusting them based on faith , and that no one really knows if their right . but this is ( 1 ) the case for all sciences , and we trust scientists when they discover the things that helped us to build satellites , and phones , and modern medicine , why not trust them now ? and ( 2 ) you can test it for yourself , if you had the means -- this is why we have multiple labs from everywhere in the world studying the climate in a bunch if different ways , and they almost all "" come to the same conclusion . but even if these upward swings of late are natural , we have an incentive to keep the climate as it has been because changes to the climate will cause massive disruption and suffering for millions of people . now , whether or not you believe acc is real , the arguments against doing anything seem to be based around the idea that no one should be able to tell you what to do . if you want to drive a gas car , eat a lot of meat , and cut down as much forrest as you want , who should be able to tell you you cant ? but we are already told what to do . you ca n't drive a car without a license , or insurance , or a seat belt . you ca n't make a car without airbags . you ca n't sell meat without proper hygenic standards . etc . etc . if acc is real ( or even if it is n't , but it 's still important to reverse the trends weve seen in the climate ) , why should n't the government enact laws to help change society in a way that will help reverse these trends ? if there was a meteor headed toward the earth , you would want the government to do everything it could to stop it would n't you ? climate change ( anthropogenic or not ) is basically a really slow , more abstract meteor heading right for us . i 'm here for the discourse . have at me .",the legitimate argument against is there is no viable fix action . if you want to get into some unintelligible studies nordhaus ' dice 2016r model on the economics of climate change explains why the fix actions wo n't work .
a0dxo3,"i do n’t see the point of having so many inherently biased atheist “ equality ” movements such as 3rd wave feminism , men ’s rights activism or black lives matter and instead we should just have egalitarianism i do n’t see the point of having so many inherently biased atheist “ equality ” movements such as 3rd wave feminism , men ’s rights activism or black lives matter and instead we should just have egalitarianism . feminism is sometimes referred to as the women ’s rights movement and by in large focuses on gender disparities in first world countries . with mras it ’s all in the name plus there is a sizable portion of them that use the movement to justify there own sexism and the problem with black lives matter is once again the focus on first world problems and and they by in large focus on one race","when you say "" i do n't see the point "" do you mean that you do n't think the issues that they 're promoting are worthy of attention , or do you mean something else ? i do n't think it 's entirely fair to expect people to be passionate about and personally advocate for all the different issues that would be encompassed by a single egalitarian movement . there 's also differences in people 's interpretation of what egalitarianism looks like ; it 's not a monolithic concept , as seen by the equality of outcome vs equality of opportunity discussion . what these various movements do really well is focussing on fairly narrow grievances which their constituents have special interest in , personal experience of , and feel very passionate about advocating . one of the big ones for mras as i understand it is unequal legal treatment with regard to child custody , and that simply was n't on the agenda for many feminists previously . this was probably because it was outside of their own perspective and personal experiences , but subsequently it was n't really addressed when it started to be publicly raised as an issue 15-20 years ago . for the feminist side , something like the taxation on things like tampons or the access to contraceptive pills ( prescription , on demand , etc. ) , is n't going to be something that a lot of men have an awareness of . because of that same problem of the issue being outside their own perspective , a man may be less likely to address it as an issue , or less likely to give it the same priority as a woman would . half of a given population is split between male and female , so you 're bound to know and share experiences with comparatively plenty of women , but a fairly large majority of the united states is white , and a fairly small majority are black ; to compound matters , they 're also not evenly distributed as is the case with men and women . this means that a much larger percentage of white people wo n't have much meaningful contact with black people compared between the contact between men and women . so if there are some issues that collectively are not being discussed between men and women as groups generally , there is going to be a larger problem in the discussion between two groups who will likely have less interaction . this may seem bleak , but you ca n't expect everyone to be up-to-date with every issue that people generally hold concerns over . due to the problem of equality not being a single concept , you ca n't expect people to simply support all groups claiming to be fighting for equality either ; people need to inform themselves , and then choose what they feel strongly enough to participate in . but there are only so many hours in the day to get things exactly right from a thousand different perspectives ; sometimes you just have to choose a focus or specialisation and stick with it . first issue : all of your complaints include these groups focusing on first world problems , but there 's no reason to believe "" egalitarianism "" would fix that . "" egalitarianism "" would still primarily focus on the problems within the society the egalitarians belong to ; that is , egalitarians in the us would still ( in theory ) focus on the problems they saw with us society . second issue : you 've already shown that , between feminism and men 's rights groups , people do n't agree on what is unequal in the us or what the solutions are . "" egalitarians "" would have to make a choice about what inequalities they saw as problems worth addressing , and when they did so , people who disagree with them would still organize under another banner . the only thing that "" egalitarians "" would have compared to mras or third wave feminism or whatever is a "" neutral "" branding , to make it seem like the people who disagreed with them do n't believe in equality . about five or six years ago , an "" egalitarian "" backlash against feminist movements happened and was super big on reddit . the problem was that all these egalitarians did was go into pro-feminist discussions and ask them to talk about men 's issues , or claim that feminism had gone too far and why are n't people agreeing with all of these proto-mra talking points . despite the branding of "" egalitarianism "" , it was still clearly a movement with defined political goals in opposition to other groups , each of which theoretically wanted equality . your point is a “ my idea is better so everyone should do it my way ” approach . people have different ideas about how to create progress , egalitarianism is a good choice , but the truth is we need them all if we want to reach the promised land . and while there is some overlap in the actions these groups should take to meet their goals ( eg , reduce consumption ) there are also a lot of specific talking points that do n't apply to other areas of focus and that need to be addressed . sure we could all just post to a single huge subreddit , but if you want to talk with people that have similar interests/issues you would have a much better chance of encountering them if you went to a specialized subreddit . if you would post about your problem in a huge general subreddit it would be lost in the sea of new posts . it 's the same with groups like feminism , men 's rights , black lives matter , etc . they can talk about similar issues and others can even point out some that they were n't even aware of . if you would ask a general egalitarian group how to achieve equality it might not be aware of the ways in which various minorities are disadvantaged . the general egalitarian group might do their best to achieve equality , but unless they 've personally lived as a minority they probably do not have any idea about the various improvements that could be done . we might not even have wheelchair ramps , descriptive audio for blind people and color-blind alternatives , because those issues affect such a small portion of the population . the french revolution was a huge win for the people . it was the first major egalitarian movement in european history . but this revolution only gave equal rights to straight white men . they tried to achieve equality for the people , but the idea that women and colored people are people still was n't in their minds . they slipped back into monarchy a few times and only several revolutions later black people and women got equal rights and the right to vote . "" all men are created equal "" did n't even apply to black men and neither to women . if women and black people would n't have created social movements they would still be second-class citizens ."
a0dj6f,"democracy is a terrible system democracy allows almost everyone to have a say in politics , excluding a small subset of people ( non-citizens , felons , children , etc. ) . this leads to the majority of votes coming from people who lack specialization in the area of policy they are voting on , we have doctors getting a say in national defense policy , firefighters voting on complex tax regulation , and economists voting on drug and medical policy . while each of these people may have a specialization within their field ( a doctor would be a good person to speak on medical policy , for example ) , the net vote comes from a vast swathe of people who simply do n't have the education or knowledge to vote on sound policy . democracy should be done away with into the trash heap of history , change my view .","i agree this can cause problems , but let 's consider what happens when only specialists vote with regards their own field ! policies sometimes require us to think broadly , and no specialist is necessarily going to have better judgement regarding those . specialists are already allowed in some countries/states to determine policies regarding their area of expertise , yet often it goes poorly as they simply vote in self serving ways ... especially financial specialists it seems . it 's also worth noting if you 're talking about us democracy , the population does n't actually vote on every policy but rather elect representatives . some policies do end up on ballots , but many are put in by legislators without the public 's direct involvement or even knowledge of it happening . you talked a lot about voter ignorance , so here 's a study that shows that , as more people vote , the outcome better serves the public interest even though most people are ignorant . next up , here 's a source that talks about how people who are more informed take more extreme views ( eek ! ) , and here 's a source that talks about how people who are more informed are less likely to change their minds in the face of new information ( another eek ! ) in other words , all the evidence we have says that voter ignorance is n't actually a problem . so , let 's talk about why democracy works well , even though the people are ignorant . the short version is that democracy is the only form of government that has a built-in system to remove people from power when they no longer serve the public interest . a longer version of this argument , which compares democracy to other options like meritocracy , can be found here . no one is saying democracy is perfect , and you ’re not the first person to point out that it has flaws . here ’s a rather comprehensive overview of the subject from a political philosophy point of view . we have many countries that are run using the democratic model ( or at least that 's how it appears on the surface , lol ) and many countries that are run under dictatorships and monarchies . if we 're to examine the evidence , i 'd argue that if you were to add up the economic wealth generated by democratic countries , and those run by dictators , i 'd expect the democratic countries to win by an absolute long shot . the people have a nonviolent means to change their government , to fix problems , to take part in their country . this is far superior to autocratic countries that provide no means of power to the people . a technocracy , where power is centered in the hands of the people who "" know best , "" is great until the people in power stop acting in the best interests of the people , or are even just perceived to be corrupt . in this case , without a nonviolent means of changing their government , the people resort to a violent one or the government violently suppresses the dissent . can you point to another way of selecting a government , either currently practiced in another country , or even a hypothetical one , which you would prefer ? also , we rarely vote directly on individual policies and issues in modern democracies . i did n't vote on my country 's welfare and tax policies , but i voted for someone who i thought was the best person to help decide these things ."
a0cy7p,"i 've become increasingly draw towards communist ideology . tell me why i 'm wrong . i 've largely stayed out of politics for the last few years . the last time i was heavily involved in politics was the scottish independence referendum . i was a passionate supporter of independence and the left wing scottish national party . but alas our side lost and i moved on . i 've consciously tried to avoid tying myself into any particular political ideology because frankly i 've become more self aware of the fact that i 'm very young ( 20 ) and i do n't really know a whole lot just yet to be vehemently politically aligned . however in general i have always been fairly left wing . i have always supported nationalisation of human essentials such as healthcare , food , water , shelter and other basic needs , but i also used to recognise how valuable and efficient private alternatives can be and have typically been in support of coexistence between the two . however , since i moved away from home two years ago and have struggled in the real world financially i 've become more and more bitter towards the capitalist system we live in . i grew to resent the fact that me and my partner were struggling so badly because we could n't find a job for so long . we both have mental health issues that basically undermined our attempts at doing well in the interview process , and our situation was making us both extremely depressed . i grew to resent the competitive nature of the job market and i felt it was unfair that people like us who ' lose ' the race end up suffering a life of discomfort simply because we did n't fit the profile of someone who could benefit an employer . i also hated the sound of every job that i applied for and i resented the fact that people have to sacrifice so much of their lives and sometimes their souls just to get by . i eventually did find a job at a restaurant , and i stuck in for about a month before i could n't take it anymore . the managers there routinely exploited their staff in various way . i was verbally and one time even physically abused , and they were forcing everyone to take on the workload of someone above their pay grade . my friend who worked there was made an ' unofficial ' head chef . he was made to perform all the duties of a head chef while on paper being employed as a regular chef just like everyone else . he was overworked to the point where he passed out , suffered workplace injuries and his mental health issues flared up like nothing else . the working rota was a joke too - they would draft up our shifts for the week at 1 in the morning on monday . so if you were supposed to be in at 7 in the morning on monday , you would have to stay awake til 1 to find out . also on several occasions i 'd finish a shift at 1 or 2 in the morning and then be made to come in at 9 for the next day . after one particularly nightmarish shift , i could n't bring myself to go back in , for my own mental and physical well-being . and yet that put me in a position were legal action could have potentially been taken against me . needless to say that whole experience was pretty harrowing . eventually we found a place in the city and got our unemployment benefit sorted out , which provided the bare minimum amount to survive . i continued looking for different jobs but fit the bill for none . i never managed to find one before i started university about 3 months ago . my girlfriend has a job as a shop assistant now , and while its a far better work environment than my experience , she 's still facing issues such as being made to work far more hours than what her employment contract states as normal working hours . at university one of my subjects is central and eastern european studies , and we 've mostly been studying the rise of communism in russia and other parts of eastern europe . for my essay i had to do in depth research into such men as vladimir lenin and leon trotsky , and honestly , as i 've followed their historical narratives , a part of me feels some sympathy for their motives . obviously i do n't condone things like the red terror or the campaigns of political repression . however a part of me interprets this as men who started with good intentions who were pulled into the quagmire of war and ended up doing terrible things in an effort to secure what they had fought for . i suppose the whole thing has got me thinking about what good might come of a communist society in the west , installed correctly . what resources that have been monopolised by the wealthy elite might be used to do real good and benefit more people . i wonder if people would n't have to sacrifice so much of their lives and souls slaving away making other people rich , just so they can get by . whether the working life could be fairer and less depressing for the average person . a society where the corrupt , capitalist conservatives currently in power would be unable to make life a living hell for the less fortunate while only representing the interests of their rich ceo and landowner buddies . but i know that all sounds so idealistic , and a part of me is telling me that i 'm just being drawn in by the good , idealistic aspects of communism . of course , i know it 's not so simple . after all why has communism never been implemented correctly ? why have millions suffered and died in the name of a supposedly fairer society ? why would a revolution against an oppressive elite , require so much force and oppression itself to work ? and though i know part of this next point can be attributed to 20th century western propaganda , it should still be considered : how can an ideology considered to be objectively extremist , on par with fascism even , and one of the most feared ideologies to ever exist , possibly be the answer we need ? as i 've said , the idealistic aspects of communism certainly appeal to me at this present moment . but ultimately i think i 'm self aware enough not to blindly follow this road without some serious fact checking . i do n't want to be another 20 something uni student who parades the hammer and sickle while not truly understanding the implications of that symbol . i do n't want to be an ideological thinker , but a critical thinker . i want to have strong , rational views based on strong foundations . so please , go ahead and change my view . tell me what 's inherently wrong with communism , and more importantly , tell me why it wo n't improve my life . tl : dr : 20 year old uni student who 's had a bad run of luck with employment and feeling bitter towards our capitalist system . i 've been increasingly drawn to the idealistic components of communism . tell me why communism is not the answer .","communism fails because most people only care about family and friends so in a communist country someone or a group is gon na have to redistribute the means or production , those people will take advantage of the system to enrich themselves and that 's why communism tends to lead to corruption who practically end up enslaving the populous for profit because who is to stop them when they own literary everything . so rather than ending up with rich ceos or landowners , you end up with politician/s who own you . communism is also bad because there is practically no incentive to work '' from each according to his ability , to each according to his needs . '' every piece of profit you make will go to someone else when that happens why should people sacrifice there time to work hard in improving in whatever education system to end up earning the same as a farmer , this leads to a shortage in well-educated workforce which gives you an inept government . this also leads to a loss in productivity because a construction worker is n't gon na work harder for a non-existing higher paying job which leads to shortages in resources which leads to famines or an infrastructure being built until eternity . read the gulag archipelago to get an idea of how abjectly terrible communism really is . so it can be hard to find a job , and employers can be exploitative towards workers who do n't have a good alternative . in a healthy market economy , the unemployment rate often drops to just a hair over what 's called natural unemployment ( which is just people in between jobs , not long-term unemployed ) — ultimately , the vast majority of people find a solution . well , solutions like a universal basic income are n't communist , and the societies that provide some of the best welfare also have extremely market-driven economies ( some of the scandinavian countries have more business freedom than the united states , for example ) . a universal basic income — whatever its problems may be — makes work not a thing of desperation , meaning you always have time and choices , but it does so without entirely doing away with the capitalist economy . entrepreneurship is a major driver of innovation and economic growth , which makes life better for everyone . for example , we 're able to have this discussion because computers were turned from an expensive investment into a commodity — which happened because bill gates stood to make a profit . but it is responsible for a lot of it , including the vast majority of modern technology . you can easily put in a lot of work and go nowhere , and end up no better off than when you started . entrepreneurship also grows the economy , and generally speaking people reinvesting profits in the hopes of making more grows the economy . in a capitalist system , you can do anything you want if you can convince someone it 's valuable — in a communist system , you 'd have to convince the government . communism has , for whatever reason , a much stronger tendency towards totalitarianism than capitalist systems . but by and large , the most crucial point is simply that capitalism , when moderated with some redistribution and regulation , tends to make everyone 's lives better . quite simply , you make money by doing something i think is worth giving you money for — a positive-sum trade ( we 're both better off ) . this incentivizes people to make things that others consider worthwhile . the absence of such an incentive also tends to lead to poor quality ; why do it right if your pay wo n't change as a result ? notice that the products of capitalist economies are usually of far superior quality , or at least that options of superior quality tend to exist ( while there 's also a market for cheap crap ) . communism has a tendency to make it so that we 're all equal insofar as we 're all impoverished together ; capitalism grows the economy and ultimately improves most people 's lots , certainly when well-managed . first , stop reading and listening to people that hold your beliefs and try hearing out the conservative capitalist argument . milton friedman is an economist i would recommend for helping you see the other side ( check him out on youtube ) . basically , anyone who understands how money works will tell you that marxism is bs and capitalism can be done right ( and wrong ) . to advocate against something though , you must have an alternative proposition that seems better than what is currently in place . the heart of why communism does n’t work : it removes profit incentives . it ’s not exactly a pretty ideal truth about the nature of humanity , but we must face the fact that human ’s are motivated by self interests . also , there ’s just too much potential for corruption and exploitation from the government in communism . in general ( throughout history ) , governments commit atrocities and the public sector serves the needs of the community . no point basing this op on second hand conceptualizations of the philosophy . communism carries to much baggage and is too idealistic for real consideration . the entire success of communism is built on misinformation about the first item and its economic model is based on the lie of the second item . if however you want to spread despair and poverty amongst the largest amount of people , communism is the right way to go . it is the social ideal of the evil and the easily duped . most critiques of the failures of capitalism outlined in the communist manifesto remain salient to varying degrees even today . the proposed remedy - communal ownership of all means of production and distribution , has been shown to be pretty toxic . the issues with capitalism - the increasing concentration of capital in the hands of few - are not unique to capitalism . most reasonable liberal democratic solutions to wealth gaps , like progressive taxation , seem to have worked . as a result , the poor feel like it 's not doing enough for them , and the rich feel like it 's too aggressive . yet , in the long-term context of history , the poor have never been better off than today , when the world is predominantly capitalist ( but not leissez faire ) with various levels of government oversight . in fact , most of the poor in europe and america own tvs , have indoor plumbing , access to clean water and electricity , are able to have vices like alcohol , etc . i do n't know how communism would or would n't improve your life . in most places where it was tried in earnest , it did n't improve the lives of most people , and greatly benefited the lives of very few . at this point , desire for private property and betterment of one 's situation seems to be as inherent a part of the human condition as any other desire - like the desire to eat more delicious things or to have sex with attractive partners . what 's required to deny any of these human desires en masse seems to be ( 1 ) a surveillance state and ( 2 ) punishments harsh enough to make pursuit of desires too risky ie violence and atrocities . most critiques of the failures of capitalism outlined in the communist manifesto remain salient to varying degrees even today . the proposed remedy -

high-speed internet access , health care and opportunities to better one 's situation . if these things are n't as easily and readily available as one would like , it may not be capitalism holding them back from everyone , but that it 's just never been normal for everyone to be able to improve one 's station in life and that we have reached capitalism 's limit to provide them . i do n't know how communism would or would n't improve your life . i do n't say that capitalism is n't without problems , and almost no country practices pure leissez faire capitalism now , and all liberal democracies have implemented some elements of socialism/means of wealth redistribution . in a capitalistic system , wealth is primarily allocated based on the good that someone does for someone else . since no one is going to buy something that does n't increase their ( perceived ) quality of life in a free , capitalistic , economy . which means that those who are doing the greatest good to the largest amount of people are going to get the most money ( sure , there are exceptions , but in general , even someone who 's inherited their wealth needs to do this in order to maintain their standard of living ) . this is ideal for making sure that society as a whole continues to advance . all you need to do , in order to advance in a capitalistic economy , is to figure out what helps the most people out the most . this is why , for example , a frycook may only make $ 8 an hour , because the benefit that a burger gives me is less than value of say , lifesaving surgery . the reason why an extremely successful performer may make more than a surgeon , is because a performer is able to reach a large number of people at once , whereas the surgeon can not even though per-person affected the surgeon is making a much larger benefit . it assumes that if you give people equal "" stuff "" they 'll end up with equal results . you can find someone who grew up in poverty and managed to do great things , and someone who grew up having anything they want yet did n't accomplish that much . thus , the best allocation for a society needs to be to give the most resources to someone who produces the most good -- capitalism does this whereas communism does not . so why do you believe you , who are refusing to create value ( and thus , helping others ) deserve others who do create value to give things to you ? can you name me a country that 's remained at least primarily communist for 50 + years and did n't have major violations of human rights or widespread poverty ? there 's been plenty of communist states ( -- url -- ) yet out of the ones who have lasted for a long period of time , can you name a single one that meets the criteria for being a decent state ? that 's simple because the elite are usually the engines moving society forward . if you want to actually follow communism and not just cherry pick the ideas you have to realize that it is an inherently violent ideology that believes violent resolution is the only way to move forward , regardless of deaths or harm caused . communism does n't work for the same reason unions eventually failed . you want kids and a wife and want to work 40 hours a week and have your weekends off . i want to get rich and work 100 hours a week and to hell with my weekend . yet communism forces us to be equal , so i look at you and consider you lazy and i hate you . no other ideology in history of the world has caused more death and suffering than communism . as somebody whose dad has grown up under communist romania , i can certainly say that there is nothing good about communism . name one communist country whose citizens were not horribly oppressed . you could make many arguments about how religion has led to violence , but i have resisted doing many bad things throughout my life , mainly because of my religion . i beleive that you can ask any normal citizen that lived in a communist regime ( china , north korea , etc. ) and 90 % will say that communism is horrible . in my dad 's opinion , communists are worse than nazis , and the death tolls back it up . you ’ve given out deltas but here ’s an attempt to sway you at least slightly back : for all their talk of capitalism leading to innovation , they ca n’t explain why the soviets put the first man in space or invented the first pocket-sized phone . for all this discussion of quality of life , no one can explain why the life expectancy and quality of life in former soviet countries is lower now . for all this talk of the market rushing to meet needs as effectively as possible , why do we have so much wasted food , water , and empty homes , and so much hunger , thirst , or homelessness ? except we do know the answer to all those questions : it is under capitalism that things do n’t happen unless they ’re profitable , and profitable does n’t necessarily mean good , innovative , or charitable . people act like the market is some natural force — all this talk of “ humans are capitalists in nature ” does n’t explain all of history in which humans were not capitalist . there are a lot of problems with communism , especially the communism practiced by the soviet union , but i think you should continue studying it . many of the deltas you have given out have suggested you ’ve barely cracked any surface regarding theory . the idea that he spent his life dedicated to philosophizing and writing only to have everything come crashing down the first time a critic replied “ ah , but what about human nature , you seem to have forgotten it ! ” my argument is n’t necessarily that communism is perfect or even a viable alternative to capitalism ( though my personal opinion is that ideologies leaning towards it work better than those leaning away ) , but that many of the most-repeated arguments against it are poorly-formed . the first problem with communism is that no one agrees on its definition . since you 've been learning about eastern europe , perhaps we should use the definition that , "" a communist country is one in which the state controls the means of production and there is one-party rule . "" the answer is more ambiguous than ideologues on either side would have you think , but the answer is basically , "" no . "" the key problem is that no one actually knows what consumers want . economies in which there is a market for the means of production ( henceforth to be called "" capitalist "" ) solve that problem by having multiple owners of similar means of production ; those who produce things consumers do n't want are allowed to go bankrupt while those who produce things consumers want become fabulously wealthy . communist countries , quite simply , do n't solve this problem at all . the state says , "" we 're going to build refrigerators and freezers as separate units now , "" and people just have to accept it . a related problem is that no one actually knows what either the means of production or the products are worth . in practice , the items are always worth different amounts to different people . in capitalist economies , that results in surpluses when transactions happen between the buyer and seller 's min/max prices . in communist economies , the state sets prices , so black markets for goods become inevitable ( which enriches criminals and incentivizes criminality , to the extent that most black markets were run by people who worked for the state ! ) we also ca n't forget that communism , in all its forms , forgets the first rule of microeconomics : people respond to incentives . if you do n't provide value to the consumer in a capitalist economy , your company goes bankrupt . if you do n't provide value to the consumer in a communist economy , as long as you are employed by the state , you 're still okay . the result is that communist economies tend to produce low quality goods and very little innovation that improves quality of life . mysteriously , every communist country in history has had one party rule . it 's almost like it 's impossible to both have complete control over economic activity and be responsive to the concerns of the citizens . this point receives it 's most readable articulation in hayek 's "" the road to serfdom "" , which i highly recommend you read . it sounds like you badly needed a union in your workplace , or some form of codetermination . i believe that the best approach is a mixed one , in which there is still a market for the means of production , but workers are able to exert some control over them ( this is why i like codetermination ) , while there is also a robust welfare state . for now , all i need to say is that communism really , truly does n't work ."
a0cm7h,"the us , canada and mexico should form an alliance similar to that of the eu , with everything from free-trade to full freedom of movement between the three countries . if you do n't know how freedom of movement in the eu works , it 's basically open-borders , but only between the counties involved . if i 'm french for example , i 'm free to move to germany where i can stay and work and effectively be treated the same as any native in the eyes of the law . that includes welfare , access to education , public services etc . i 'm a big believer that capitalism and globalization are the only way to improve the quality of life of all people on earth . they 're the only way the global poor can improve their living and make money without relying on international aid . it 's also the best way for rich countries to become even richer , with access to more varied and less expensive goods on their market . if you do n't believe this fact to be True , you do n't understand capitalism . all of this goes the same for labor . people from poor countries not only have the right to seek a chance to a better life , but it 's in their human nature to do so . trying to restrict this just as dumb and counterproductive as the war on drugs . this , of course is known among economists : -- url -- -- url -- -- url --","another issue that would inevitably happen with freedom of movement , especially for mexico would be a brain drain . leaving nobody to help better the country . this happens in the eu where anyone capable will leave their poorer home country like estonia or poland for the richer ones like germany and britain . you do n't need free movement of people to reap the benefits from a global labour market . sure , wealthy eu countries benefit from having cheap labour from eastern europe come and work . but they do n't benefit from all the criminals and people seeking welfare . so the better solution for the rich western countries would , obviously , be to import the cheap labour but not the criminals , people seeking welfare etc . the only way to sustainable allow freedom of movement between incompatible cultures is to eliminate welfare -- otherwise you 'll have a large proportion of people who are parasitic chasing the $ $ $ $ . the eu has a lot of problems with this , where plenty of low-skilled workers ( or non-workers ) will take advantage of this and will either move from non-eu countries to countries with liberal "" asylum "" laws , or move from eu countries with minimal welfare , to eu countries with more socialistic governments . if i had no intention of working , or were a low skilled worker , why would n't i move at the first opportunity to a land where i can get $ $ $ $ $ for free that 's paid by someone else ? incompatible cultures can not co-exist and free migration , especially in countries like the us and canada which are massive welfare states would mean a disaster for the american and canadian taxpayer . the schengen area works because most member states have similar living standards , so you do n't see germany being overrun by france 's poor and vice versa ."
a09586,"pedophiles who do not act on their urges ( including porn and molestation ) should not be shamed . i know that on the surface this sounds bad , but here ’s the reasons i think this . 1 . ) although i am 100 % , wholeheartedly for gay rights , i still believe than any variation on homosexual attraction is not biologically correct . the whole point of sex , when it comes down to it , is reproduction . and any attraction that does not result in a child is not biologically correct . not wrong , just biologically incorrect . so , i do n’t understand how one unchosen attraction is okay while another is not , as long as it does n’t harm anybody . 2 . ) pedophiles who look at child porn and harm children are pieces of shit . absolutely . however , we should not be upset at people who admit to attraction to children , but restrain from acting on them anyway whatsoever . i know it sounds bad , but how are you supposed to change who you are attracted to ?","people act on their impulses all the time ; can we really trust a pedophile to always be able to resist their impulses ? human beings use sex to create strong social bonds , and social bonds that bind communities so that they work together are essential to the survival of the species . a gay couple may not produce children , but their marriage can still create a social bond that not only joins the two of them , but their families together , making survival more likely for all . pedophilic relationships , even if they could be consensual , could not create similarly lasting bonds , because the child eventually becomes an adult , and the pedophile will typically no longer be satisfied . pedophiles should not express their feelings in any way that could lead to children becoming aware of them . i do n't believe children are emotionally equipped to cope with the possibility of an adult having those kinds of feelings toward them . however , i do n't think most people start raping just because of attraction . there is no reason to suppose that pedophiles are going to necessarily harm kids , any more than all straight men will rape every woman any time they have a chance . i think most of them probably do n't need help to not rape children ( most people can experience attraction and not rape people , even if they are celibate ) . and reassurance that they have agency , if they are afraid they might hurt children . there are a lot of would-be pedophiles who get themselves castrated because they know it would only be a matter of time before they could no longer resist acting on it . they should be still regarded as dangers and forced to undergo intensive therapy as to prevent them from harming children . pedophiles who do not try to stop their desires actively and willingly undergo therapy are bad people , because they are risking children by not isolating themselves and thus lowering the risk . regarding homosexuality , it is technically a mental disorder , as it deviates from the evolutionary purposes of sex , which are reproduction and building a family , but it is not harmful to anyone and therefore people should n't be forced not to be homosexual . the biological level because reproduction is meant to actually further the species , rather than only providing pleasure , and because it hampers the mental state of the victm and can cause them to develop disorders too , along with making them suffer , which is generally bad for our species , as it would make more individuals which do not contribute to our society tl ; dr : pedophiles who actively seek to be treated , make efforts not to follow their urges , isolate themselves as to lower risk , and do not engage in interactions with children are n't bad people , but pedophiles who simply do n't do anything regarding it and do n't seek therapy are bad people because they are still keeping the risk there . regarding argument 1 ) one-night stands are socially acceptable , however do not serve the intended purpose of procreation . if someone is attracted to children , it does n't do anybody any good to come out with that . i do agree that non-practicing pedophiles should be offered compassion and support by society , and more importantly : any support that helps them to not give in to actual child molestation . however , the idea that this follows from accepting homosexuality as not "" biologically correct "" is a bad argument . the better argument is that non-practicing pedophiles have done nothing wrong , and society needs to help them stay that way . and the majority of pedophiles do n’t ever want to abuse a child because of that love . generally speaking , strategies that make a piece of dna more likely to be replicated over and over again tend to propagate ( note : this is not the same as saying strategies that make an organism more likely to reproduce . you can hurt your own reproductive chances while improving a set of dna you share 's chances and it will be a successful strategy . in a community overpopulated by males , having a group of males with no sexual interest but strong family bonds is a great survival strategy since they wo n't be wasting resources competing for mates and can focus on other things , which is probably why the more older brothers you have the more likely you are to be gay ) . behaviours that inhibit reproduction are less likely to last in the long term but that 's not incorrect biology . going after a swath of people incapable of stopping you who are easily manipulated into believing you when you say they should n't take is , absent a society that shames child molestation and rape , a pretty good strategy . the point is , looking at what 's biologically successful does n't tell you anything about how homosexuality , pedophilia or anything else should be treated because we have no moral imperative to reproduce . we ca n't dumb down our feelings about something like this , else these sort of thought patterns will become normalized . if we as society no longer express our negative feelings , we could lead them to the idea that maybe its not as terrible and awful as they thought . we have to offer them that outside influence of negativity as a motivator to continue fighting against those thoughts . we do n't want to punish someone for something they may not be able to control . we can also support their avoidance of acting on their thoughts and even celebrate their success in doing so . if we can offer them safely and comfortably , we should do the same as we would with any other friend that is struggling with any other intrusive or shameful thoughts . if my friend is struggling with the temptation to cheat on her husband , i 'm not going to call her a terrible person , tell her to get out of my life and announce to everyone what an awful thing she 's thought about . i 'm going to offer my support and encouragement to help her do the right thing , but i 'm not going to pretend that i do n't care if she destroys her life and the lives of those around her . i agree that non-offending pedophiles should n’t be shamed for their unwanted sexual desires because that is the only way we ’ll be able to offer them actual resources to control their desires so that they do n’t end up abusing children . however , pedophilia is considered a mental disorder by the apa , but homosexuality has n’t been considered a mental disorder since 1973 . the resolution that struck down homosexuality as a mental disorder basically said that “ we will no longer insist on a label of sickness for individuals who insist that they are well and demonstrate no generalized impairment in social effectiveness , ” highlighting the crucial difference between those who are simply attracted to the same gender as opposed to those who are attracted to children : homosexuals do not deem their lifestyle wrong and consider themselves to be well , whereas most non-offending pedophiles ( iirc there ’s another term for it but it ’s slipping my mind ) know that their desires are wrong and they want to change it . so , in short , there should be less of a stigma with non-offending pedophiles , but it ’s misleading to conflate homosexuality and pedophilia . however , someone once pointed out that homosexuality is prevalent in the animal kingdom and that it 's likely an evolutionary means of keeping population smaller , so as to provide ample food , shelter , so on , without straining resources , while also providing adults to help harvest , protect , etc . homosexual desires can manifest themselves as consensual sex , rape , or masturbation . there is no consensual way to have ' real ' sex as a pedophile , which to me makes it an immoral sexuality to advocate acceptance for . i think the best course of action for someone who likes children is compartmentalizing their attraction , and staying in the closet about it . i do n't see any benefit to having pedophiles openly admit their desires , whereas decreasing the occurrence that people meet and know pedophiles ( by having them all hide it ) will make a taboo activity unacceptable prima facie . pedophiles are attracted to children that have n’t even hit puberty yet . in the end , i would n't hate that person , but i definitely would not actively seek that person out as a friend or something ."
a06flx,"it is hypocritical for many people in the west to be okay with disliking/judging someone based on their political/social views . in the liberalized western world , i think most ( or at least many ) people probably believe one should not dislike/judge others based on factors such as race , sex , sexual orientation , etc . from my understanding , it seems the basic argument is that it is ridiculous to dislike/judge people based on characteristics that they are born with ; or more fundamentally , factors over which they have no control . i am sure there are other arguments that are sometimes used here , but i believe this particular argument to be by far the most common . perhaps this is indeed how we ought to act . supposing that it is , it seems strange to me the way so many people treat political/social views . many people in the liberal west will probably have a very negative first impression of someone who is opposed to gay marriage , to use just one example . to me , there are two things that need to be True in order for this to make sense and not be a hypocritical position ( assuming that these people believe in not disliking/judging others based on things like race , sex , etc ) . firstly , at least some normative statements about society would have to be True . secondly , and much more relevant to this topic , people would have to have control over their beliefs . i see very little reason to think that people are in control over their own beliefs . i 'm certainly open to the idea - i think it 's possible that something like a metaphysical free will ( for example ) exists . but again , i do n't see much of a reason to believe that this is the case , just that it could potentially be . so , to change my view here , you 'd probably have to do one of two things : 1 . convince me that people are in control over their beliefs . 2 . convince me that it 's not hypocritical for many people to dislike/judge someone for their political/social views , even if people are n't in control over their own beliefs . there are probably other ways you could change my view , but those two ways seem like the most direct paths . thanks for reading ! note : i am using the merriam-webster definition of hypocritical here , for clarification . it is as follows : characterized by behavior that contradicts what one claims to believe or feel . also , by ' west ' , i mean what i presume the fairly standard meaning is , that being essentially europe and the anglosphere .","because the people judging truly believe that it 's a matter of self control , it ca n't be hypocritical on their part , even if technically they 're wrong . i would agree with you that most people are n't fully in control of their beliefs . it 's very clear that biology plays a role in how we believe things , but at the same time we also know that people can exert some level of control . if your first statement is correct , then people are not in control of their beliefs . so , if people have no free will to decide how they act , then they ca n't be hypocritical about their actions , because they never had a choice . there ’s a theory some guy coined called the paradox of tolerance or something like that . anyway , to the point , the theory states that you can not tolerate intolerance . any view that states you should n’t be tolerant of some people , ironically , should not be tolerated because if that view is allowed to flourish , the end result will be intolerance instead of tolerance . i do n't think it matters at all whether people are in control of their beliefs . it boils down to whether or not it 's hypocritical to judge someone on political/social views . there is a difference between dislike and blame , but you completely ignore that distinction in your post . i dislike that flat-earthers have grown to include such a wide following ( including those in my personal friends and family ) , but i do not blame them for growing up in an environment that completely failed to give them even the slightest grasp of critical thinking skills . i dislike the fact that people who deny the truth about agw have been voted into the highest office of government , but i do not blame them for being unable to grasp even a rudimentary understanding of the scientific method . in the same way , i dislike that many people are so ignorant that they are actually still opposed to gay marriage , but i do not blame them for conforming to the backwards doctrines of their made-up santa claus ( or god or genie or whatever they call it ) . i do n't know what someone believes unless they tell me , or act in a way that would lead me to conclude they had a belief . regardless of whether True free will exists or not , pragmatically we as a society treat everything a person does or thinks as ' their actions and thoughts ' , and take it for granted that they have control over it - see justice system for prime example . just as we would n't take much stock of a murder saying ' i did n't have intent to kill because the physical properties of my brain meant i never had a free will to form intent ' , we dont take much stock in someone saying ' i do n't have free will to form beliefs ' . i 'd suggest this is the right course of action , since we do n't know if free will exists , and more importantly society could n't function under assumption that it does n't exist . in regards to people being ' in control ' of their beliefs : it is evident that people do n't choose their beliefs - they simply believe everything they learn about that has the evidence necessary to convince them . as soon as you encounter evidence necessary to convince you of something , you automatically believe it , even if it replaces a belief you previously held . but your wording equates ' belief ' and ' political stance ' when those are n't necessarily the same , and also uses ' control ' in a way that ignores people 's abilities to 1 ) lie , and 2 ) ignore their actual beliefs over something they value more , for example their self-interest . so it is possible for a person to actually , honestly believe that all the races are equal , and that a society that treats all races equally is the best society for anyone who is dropped into a society sight unseen , but also recognize that they live in a society with a majority of the population being their race , and that in regards to their self-interest , and their selfish wants , a society that treats their race better is better for them . so their political stance on race is n't their belief regarding race , and when asked , they will lie , and say they believe some race is inferior and should n't be allowed a fair share of resources , thereby promoting their self-interest . if you ask a person why they are a certain race , sex , sexual orientation they would say that they were born that way . but if you ask them why they support a certain political belief they would give you logic/reasoning/justification . its not hypocritical since they are n't saying "" they were born with a political stance "" but they generally are with race and sex ."
a05xzo,"the us has n't fought a just war since the one against fascism . that 's all there is to it , but i got ta fill 500 words , so here goes . everything since wwii has been one indefensible atrocity after another . usually done to undermine democratic movements which threatened capitalist hegemony , but always because it was seen as essential to maintaining that interest , commonly referred to as the military industrial complex . the few exclusions might be the temporary interventions to prevent genocide or war crimes , coups , such as in kosovo , which was certainly an exception to the rule in that it seemingly held no strategic advantage other than to maintain order in europe . it was a short campaign . it was effective in that it brought both sides to the table and the use of force was very precise . change my view","jus ad bellum can be boiled down to a just cause ( eg not for profit , not solely as punishment , not just regaining territory , not futile , primarily to right a wrong or protect or defend innocent/civilian lives . jus in bello is how combatants engage and how they are directed to engage . ( these definitions are taken from an international law masters i never finished and wikipedia and are not 100 % taking into account contradictory theorists ) under these definitions , the us did n't fight a just war in ww2 . so in closing : the us did n't even fight a just war against fascism , even though one was possible the fight against fascism developed after they joined the war . to the world , it seems like the us just randomly invaded vietnam to spread freedom , killing thousands of innocents with napalm and bombing . we could n't risk ussr influence and communism spreading into both europe and southeast asia , so we sent troops to vietnam to help them . we could have ended the war in a month by bombing ho chi minh city and sending us troops to the beaches near there . we held a naval blockade of the city for the duration of the war , but international pressure stopped us from taking the city . take away the influence of capitalism and/or democracy globally and you open up potential for other ideologies like communism or facism to spread . every war the us has fought since ww2 has in some way been a way to protect our way of life . russia also invaded afghanistan back in the 1980s , which our intelligence believed would eventually extend into an invasion of iran . so maintaining control in the middle east and asia protects our resources and trade routes , which thereby allows the west to continue to go on living the way we have . our current agreement in nato is to provide military aid and protection of europe . sure , europe helps to some extent ( although arguably not enough ) , but the us picks up most of the efforts . sure , the wars are a seemingly unnecessary loss of life ... but i 'd argue we 'd be in a worse position in the west if we did n't fight to maintain our influence . do you believe that the us was justified fighting the fascists because they were fascists or because the us was attacked by japan and then germany declared war on us ? because the us did not go to war to end fascism . as it turns out , we also intervened in a civil war in afghanistan out of self defense ."

a04dfm,"calling the us part of the "" west "" is a mild form of ethnic nationalism and is supremely unhelpful i submit the following contentions : 1 . the government of the us is not , in any sense , based on the christian religion . the us started life as a british colony but it is not situated in europe nor did it involve itself much in european affairs before ww1 . 2 . the us began life as a majority white country , however its current laws whether federal or state do not have race imbued in them . ( we can argue whether the civil rights act explicitly sets white americans apart on the basis of case law , but it does not do so in the plain language of the text ) 3 . in american political discourse , "" western values "" are taken as a catch all to refer to liberal democracy . this is , at best , disingenuous and , at worst , quite bigoted . only the uk and , to an extent , revolutionary france can be said to have any tradition of free speech . germany certainly has no tradition of liberal democracy until it was imposed upon them . the same goes for spain , portugal , italy , greece and the balkans . 4 . in american political discourse , "" judeo-christian "" is similarly taken as a catch all to refer to some form of mild christian and jewish religiosity in society . in truth , any impartial reading of history will show that this claim is incompatible with # 3 above and that the historical european empires along with their mainland nations were deeply anti-semitic ( with lethal consequences ) . 5 . all this being said , if the us is an extension of the "" west "" , and the "" west "" refers to europe , then to be an american of non-european stock is to be , at best , a stepchild and , at worst , a perennial transplant . because european-americans come from the tradition that birthed america , and the rest of us did not . this also is in some conflict with the idea of the us as a nation of creed and not blood and soil . 6 . if the us is an extension of the "" west "" , then in some sense the fundamental character of the us depends on its majority ethnicity and will change when that ethnicity changes . however , if the us is its own nation that stands on its own tradition , that is not the case . you can see these arguments being hinted at the fringes of the identitarian right . 7 . my final contention is that the reality of geography is that the us is not part of the west . it is not part of europe . it has a pacific and an atlantic coast and is situated on its own continent . what 's good for europe is not necessarily good for the us and furthermore , what 's bad for europe might turn out to be supremely beneficial to the us . ( those who oppose this statement would do well to remember how the us achieved its current superpower status ) thus , on the basis of these contentions i argue that calling the us a "" western "" nation is historically incorrect , strategically unhelpful , and creates a feeling among non-western americans that they are not quite full citizens culturally speaking . a cultural narrative that places the us as the inheritor of one ethnic group vs another is the definition of ethnic nationalism . it is mild because it is only mildly irritating and not largely hurtful . i invite you to change my view","the principle of natural rights , discussed in the declaration of independence and secured by the constitution , comes directly from the western european enlightenment . american principles of civility and diplomacy were inherited from western europe ( mostly england and france ) and still have power today . looked at practically , a us citizen could be dropped into the middle of any western european country and not feel hopelessly out of place . when people say the us is a western nation , that 's pretty much what they mean . before i really go into it , it 'd be useful for me to know what you consider to be the defining characteristics of a western nation . 2 - it appears that all of western europe , the united states , canada , and australia ( aka the western world ) rank pretty high in press freedom index ... which i would imagine is a fairly good barometer for freedom of speech . in fact , germany and portugal are ranked significantly higher than the us and great britain . the west is all nations that are culturally descended from europe . these connections go to the 1500s , they do not start at wwi as you seem to think . and they all hold cultural values tied to their european colonizers , including all the south american nations ( which are ethnically white by the way due to european descent ) . and those that do not share these values of their country are not fully citizens of said country culturally speaking . russia at times behaves european and at times behaves asian but is generally considered a part of the east . africa is for the most part ignored in these designations , though north-eastern africa due to the ottoman empire is considered eastern while the pockets of former colonies such as south africa are considered western . of course such terminology is brittle against any sort of nuance , but "" west "" refers to enlightenment ideals . the us is unique in our reverence for a constitutional republic . this is in contrast to the "" east , "" which certainly gets more murky and stereotypical when you talk about the "" far east "" or confucianism , vs the middle or near east , which perhaps implies a shared heritage of byzantine and turkish and arab cultures ."
a049qp,"the lgbt community should stop claiming the opression of homosexuality in the past . i 'm a 29 year old gay man in the south of the us . i 'm out to everyone i know , and am fortunate to be ( finally ) living in a fairly progressive city . the lgbt community frustrates me . i understand that we 've made great strides in tolerance in recent years due to the tireless work of many activists within said community . ( seriously , a standing ovation to the gay pr team , y' all have done the seemingly impossible in a very short amount of time , i 'm eternally grateful . ) through their efforts , homosexuality has been normalized and homophobia marginalized ( in the west , at least . ) however there seems to be a bit of an oppression contest going on in many left-leaning groups . it 's certainly True that queer people are still oppressed in manifold ways throughout the world . i have my own experiences of it , and i 'm sure many others do as well . the nature of any progressive cause calls for more improvement by it 's very definition . so , why do certain members of the community muddy the waters by claiming the opression of lgbt people in the past ? these people ( largely ) were not your ancestors , they 're no more kin to you than they are to heterosexuals . i 'm not trying to marginalize their suffering . alan turing suffered a terrible fate , and he was famous . all ( reasonable ) parties agree that lgbt people of old were n't treated with dignity or respect . how does that relate to our experience as queer folk today ? they should be remembered and honored , but the opression they suffered was n't ours as individuals . i understand ethnic minorities claiming the opression of their forebearers . in many cases it bled down over the years and was the foundation for the hardships of their progeny . the lgbt culture is a largely political one . it 's like communists owning the opression of the mccarthy era . owning the opression of lgbt people of the past cheapens the argument for gay rights , and makes me roll my eyes . cmv .","i also think by and large it helps lgbt people , especially isolated young lgbt people caught in bad situations or dealing with self-hate , to identify with those who survived similar or worse atrocities and abuse in the past , and helps them feel less alone . it 's common for people to sympathize with historical figures more than they do their contemporaries to the point they believe they 're a reincarnation of that person . i 'm guessing a lot of lgbt people simply connect with past lgbt figures and their tragedies and accomplishments in a more personal way and feel a kinship or understanding . it 's not a collective experience if you choose to close yourself off to it and choose not to look at the tapestry or legacy of people of lgbt people surviving and fighting through history , even if they did n't know or embrace what they were doing at the time , but many people do n't and absolutely do create lgbt communities that work as collectives , or actively feel more loyalty to the lgbt community than their actual families due to abuse or disownment or a sense of loyalty to people who share their struggles . and also an inner realization that the people who are most likely to have your back are the ones with the same enemies , hence lgbt folk largely becoming a collective network for survival . a lot of this is recent history , if not current events . its a grey line between current events , recent history , and more distal history . i 'm not very familiar with the queer community , so i 'm not quite sure what you mean by owning/claiming . you say that you understand that the gay community has been oppressed and marginalized throughout the history of the united states . you then go on to claim that you understand that the same oppression and marginalization of gay people continues to be a fact of life for those who are unfortunate enough to not live in a country that has laws that protect them . and knowing all of this you then conclude that the greatest injustice happening to the gay people that lived and continue to live in societies that threat them as if they are less then human is that the gay people such as yourself have the audacity to point out and identify with them . you then go on to state that because gay people today are not direct descendants of the gay people that were beaten , killed , marginalized , imprisoned and forgotten ; then that somehow means that they ca n't claim that part history as their own . if you as a gay man have a problem with people wanting to preserve their stories then who else is going to ? you act like this is ancient history when it has n't even been a decade that gay people won the right to get married . i would just like you to understand that groups that protect lgbt rights are formed because gay people as individuals can not bring about the same amount of change that gay people as a collective can . and that advocating to preserve the history of a marginalized group is never a bad thing . in your opinion , should the scotus ruling from 3 years ago be overruled so that same sex marriage can be decided upon on a state-by-state basis ? in your opinion , is black history ( in particular , slavery , sharecropping , and segregation through jim crow laws ) relevant to the socioeconomic we see today between black people and white people ? you should clarify what you mean by "" owning the oppression of lgbt people of the past "" because it 's not completely clear by your op . lgbt people are also a minority group that have faced oppression in the past . queer people are still a community , whether or not we 're tied by blood , and it 's not like there 's a clear line between "" the past "" and "" the present . "" middle-aged queer people are part of my community , and those people who were left to die by their society are part of their community , so are n't we all connected that way ? the closest analogy i can think of is religion , although religion is admittedly something that 's usually passed down within families . i may not have had any ancestors here at the time , but this country is my country , so its history is my history too . past people like you are your forebears . they might be like you because they 're your biological ancestors , or they might be like you because they 're part of the same religious or national or sexual community , but their lives are still your history . walk into your local gay bar on a busy night . the stigma against homosexuality was so great that president of the us did n't even utter the name of the virus until 5 years after it was identified , let alone provide funding for care and research that could have helped his sick , dying gay citizens and possibly control the outbreak ."
a0431x,"loaded . it sucks to be black . it ’s even worse to be mixed and look black . -- url -- in the video most people in the comments would argue everyone except the black guy is white - despite having ethnic backgrounds such as japanese or even native american most people in comments even were confused why they would identify with anything else . but even so it would n’t change the fact that the black guy is most likely subject to discrimination outside of that room . i ’m also aware that singers like halsey and tori kelley do n’t identify as white . even so they would n’t face discrimination . it just feels like people with more than “ x ” amount of melanin are subject to discrimination and being outgroupers to society . now add being mixed like me . black , white , and asian . most of my friends growing up were white . i never really fit in the black people . in today ’s political climate i find it hard to not feel awkward around anyone also , as it turns out , i mostly attracted to white women . dating is already tough . this video explains why in a little more detail . i know the buzzword sex is in the title but the general idea revolves around dating -- url -- i do n’t think i ’m attractive enough to stand out from other guys , especially considering the type of women i ’m attracted to . not to mention the stigmas of being a black guy attracted to white women such as the attraction being nothing more than a fetish . i ’m pretty sure my attraction to white women has something to do with me growing up with white women . so yea i basically ca n’t really relate to anyone . in today ’s racially wired society i ’d count my lucky stars if someone of a different race accepted me into their social circle . not to mention that i ’m now just another statistic of a multiracial person with identity issues further cementing the notion i should n’t exist .","i 'm the child of a white father and a mostly indigenous latina mother , but i pass for white and almost never experience racism . it 's entirely conceivable to me that the darkest-skinned ( typically the most sub-saharan african by blood ) black people could get treated the worst in terms of the racism they face ."
a03pu5,"a left-wing revolution in the usa is virtually doomed to failure , and left-of-center solutions are better implemented through democracy than through revolution . i ’ve seen the idea of violent revolution bandied about a lot on reddit . stringing the fat cats up , seizing the means of production , and all that . i think a lot of younger people find the idea of “ wiping the slate clean , ” so to speak , appealing . and who does n’t , from time to time ? the american right is indeed hostile verbally towards its ideological opponents and generates more spontaneous lone-wolf violence than the left by far . the idea that our political system is damaged – nay , broken – and that democracy is increasingly unlikely to offer up solutions to american society ’s problems is not uncommon on reddit . the rhetoric of commenters on r/politics , for example , grows more strident and aggressive all the time , and hard left-wing subs like r/chapotraphouse talk openly about revolution . since otherwise i will be accused of being a nazi or something similar , i must caveat that i despise donald trump and his brand of reactionary conservatism and that at this time the right is a far more significant threat to democracy and liberty than the right . but that can change . my view is that a left-wing revolution in the usa is a chimera that is near impossible to achieve , and even if achieved would result in complete disaster . the last , best hope for liberals and leftists alike is the democratic process and the ballot box . 1 . for reasons that should be obvious , any resort on the part of the left to violence will come up against a severe and perhaps insurmountable speed bump : the lack of trained individuals in the execution of violence . the majority of law enforcement officers and military servicemembers are on the center or right wing ; moreover , they have a vested interest in the preservation of the current system . these two groups alone could bring overwhelming force against any revolution , even without resort to mass casualty producing weapons such as air strikes or missiles . furthermore , of the civilian population , those most likely to possess firearms and know how to use them are also center to right-wingers . if we look at past revolutions , the french and russian revolutions both included significant parts of their armies , including the officer corps , from the beginning . the modern american left ’s innate aversion to these groups will prevent any alliance from gaining significant support . in short , the vast , vast bulk of those capable of violence are against a leftist revolution from the beginning , and modern leftist ideology prevents any alliance with these groups . 2 . geography is dead-set against any political uprising as well . most uprisings will take place , as they always have , in urban centers – washington d.c. , for instance , or new york or the bay area . this is not only where most leftist americans live or are attracted to , but historically it is easier to gain revolutionary support from the working poor than the more conservative rural poor . this is the second major issue . american interdependence and economic development mean that resource flow into an urban center will cease once it tries to set up an independent government . this means no food , no fuel , no electricity , and probably no cell phone or internet service – especially if government forces actively work against the revolution as they will . it would be a simple matter for the military along with local militias to blockade washington d.c. from all outside support and allow the revolutionary inhabitants to rot . without communication services , they will be unable to coordinate a strategy or plan their next move with fellow uprisings throughout the country . the military and political leadership of the counterrevolution would be able to isolate and destroy each uprising as they saw fit . sea and air would be even more dangerous than attempts to resupply and refit by land as the u.s. military would have unquestioned control over these areas . in short , the revolution is likely to be localized and urbanized – and thus easy for the established authorities to isolate and annihilate . 3 . not only is the left outgunned and divided , but it is also divided amongst itself and for a good reason . there are more genres of socialism , communism , and anarchism than there are genres of jazz music , and all of them seem to distrust the other . the flagship revolutions – france and russia – saw frequent infighting and purging during and immediately after the revolution . in 1789 , the french revolution was able to isolate and capture king louis xvi ; by 1792 , the original leaders of that revolution had fled or been executed when the committee of public safety led by danton and robespierre took power , and within a year robespierre had eliminated all resistance , including his comrade danton , before he was removed and executed in 1795 . russia saw the provisional government overthrow the tsar , only to be overthrown themselves by lenin ; lenin ’s death in 1924 saw a cloak-and-dagger power struggle between stalin and trotsky that did n’t end until trotsky had an icepick in his skull . the purging by paranoid stalin , anxious to avoid robespierre ’s fate , killed hundreds of thousands and helped turn soviet russia into a horrific hellhole . if anything , the modern leftist movement is even more fragmented ; it has no clear leader and no clear creed , no strategy , and no ultimate sense of means , ends , or end state . constant purity contests and calcification of doctrine keep the hard left from unifying into a cohesive bloc . this is not the result of repression , but the lack thereof : no one is hunting communists nowadays , everyone can say whatever they want , and somehow in this open society the left is farther from consensus than ever in the past . in short , the american left has no united front and no overarching strategy . 4 . most , if not all , revolutions have had the support of at least a large group of the population . the french and russian systems were autocratic , oppressive , and politically exclusive to a degree that has never been approached in american political history . in 1789 and 1917 , respectively , financial and military pressures had shattered the prosperity of the lower and middle classes – indeed , the french/russian revolutions both started as middle-class revolutions . the price of food was astronomical , the government was crumbling financially , and any attempts at reform were met with at best indifference , at worst violent retribution . the situation was bad enough that people were willing to risk what they had in exchange for something better . that is not only laughably unlikely in american society ; it is not even accomplished by those on the left . for all the lip service that leftists pay to “ having to participate in the oppressive system , ” it ’s a tad bit ironic how guiltlessly they indulge in smartphones , video games , social media , and imported produce while criticizing not only the system but the very corporations that produce those goods . this is not the mark of a movement that wants americans as a whole to be prepared to risk sacrificing everything in an uprising against the government , the corporations , the military , and millions of their fellow citizens . as damaged and bitter as our political situation has become , the american people remain on the average well-fed , with electricity and shelter ; they have little fear of being killed in a violent war or being spirited away in the dead of night by the secret police . compared to past revolutions , the american people have much to lose , and little to gain , by joining the uprising . in short , the people have very few incentives to risk their livelihood by joining a revolution . the existing system , then , is the arena in which left and liberal alike must make their bid for change and freedom . their ideas must be crafted and molded to convince the majority of the people ; they must win over the disaffected and alienated from society , in particular , the obama-trump voters in swing states . all the complaining in the world about the electoral college , the senate , gerrymandering , and so forth will not avail the american left-of-centrists unless they are in a position to do something about it , and that means playing the game as it is until they are in a place to change the rules . i am all for getting rid of the electoral college , but you have to be in a position to see it done through either state compacts or passing a constitutional amendment . i am all for changing the legislature , but it can not and will not be changed without changing the constitution . i am on board with medicare for all , but you have to get both houses of congress . i think gerrymandering is sickening and should be eradicated , but until there is a credible solution ( i ’ve seen many , all incomplete ) and the means to see it done , it does n’t amount to a hill of beans . the answer to all of these is winning , winning , winning at the ballot box and in the congress , and that is what left and liberal together must focus their entire effort on – without regard or even lip service to some revolutionary ideal . one final question for those who want a revolution ( well ya know … we all want to change the world ) : what happens if you lose ?","and i think those who argue for revolution would want to get ( 1 ) the military on board and would want to stage a revolution at a critical point when they would get ( 4 ) a sizable portion of populace on board . in other words , points ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) do not preclude a successful revolution ( see french , russian , revolutions ) and points ( 1 ) and ( 4 ) are achievable at the right time and place . so you might be right that a left wing revolution is not possible now , but i disagree with your point that it 's doomed to failure in principle . you just said my thoughts exactly regarding an overthrowing of the government , however if instead it was mass rioting targeting governmental buildings it would definitely have a different affect . it would scare government officials and hopefully it would make them try to restrict rights and freedoms thus allowing violent rioters to get more sympathy until a sufficient amount of leftists are i political power . i highly doubt most people supporting a socialist revolution think it 's going to happen tomorrow . calling for a revolution most likely serves the purposes of venting anger and normalizing the idea of a revolution . you must realize that what a revolutionary socialist wants to accomplish is not compatible with a capitalist system . if the very core of the system is functioning incorrectly , there 's no change within the system that 's gon na change it . now i 'm not actually american , but it seems really weird to me that you 're adding "" liberals "" ( which i get is not about just being ' liberal ' , the american terminology is weird ) , "" leftists "" and the "" revolutionary left-wing "" into the same group of people , and that makes the post on its own really weird . what i 'm getting at is that i assume you 're talking about "" free healthcare "" or "" higher taxes "" as your description of what a "" leftist "" , "" liberal "" or "" revolutionary leftist "" wants to accomplish , while the revolutionary ones want to crush capitalism in its entirety and the others do not . it always makes me wonder how people calling for guillotines for xyz can operate and not get banned.i have never been called a jew here as an insult but "" fascist gets a bullet "" or that "" guillotine is waiting for me "" happen quite often . xx century has shown well enough that violent left wing revolutions just end up in totalitarian regimes killing millions of people while keeping the rest of them locked inside their countries with little to no freedom . people discussing these revolutions can dream about their utopia that they never had to experience and us is lucky to never even get close to the risk of such movements but this leads to no living memory of what real socialism was.as soviet union fades from memory it is getting more popular to claim that "" it was not that bad "" and plenty of posts on lsc are taking information out of context and using it to show how superior life in the ussr was compared to the late capitalism us . it is scary that people like tankies you see on chapo exist their denial of genocide committed by the various regimes and extreme willingness to repeat this make them similar to some neonazis that claim that holocaust never happened and most things we know about totalitarian nature and crimes of the 3rd reich is just "" jewish propaganda "" . i 'm not a leftist , actually i see myself as a neutral , but since brazil is passing through a simillar situation as in the us ( our new president is seen as the trump 2.0 ) , i kinda understand why people are indignant to all that happened . but my view is that one part of our society , the more left oriented ones , ca n't accept the fact the democracy helped elect someone they hated so much as the new president that they started to doubt and criticize the same system they defended through their lives . like ... they wo n't accept another views , another ways , even calling the other side nazis and stuff . for me , this situation is very clear as day , to me , that shows how people , truly , do n't like democracy , they like it when the reigning system operates as they wish , even if it does n't for the other half of the population . the left , socialist party , "" pt "" ( "" partido dos trabalhadores "" , or workers party ) , reigned here for 13 years , by the force of 2 presidents from that party , but realistically , it was one leader , lula . as of 2018 , lula is in jail for corruption , many from pt is or investigated , or in jail , even the guy that tried the presidency , haddad , is investigated . venezuela is what socialism leads to , and communism is what cuba , or china , leads to ( and china adopted a capitalist economical system , but works , as a society , in communism ) . i lived in 13 years of pt trying to turn brazil into venezuela , seeking the examples of socialist countries , and the result is that we are living in one of the biggest economical crisis in our history ."
a01kwl,"the #metoo movement is dangerous for using bad rhetoric to justify assuming people are guilty until proven innocent here in america , as in most of the modern world , people on trial are to be considered innocent unless the accuser ( s ) show beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty . the #metoo movement encourages the opposite and uses faulty rhetoric to do so . for example , people will often say they support the survivor and will believe the survivor . this is an issue because using the term “ survivor ” means they ’re already assuming that the accused is guilty . you ca n’t know if they ’re a rape survivor if it has n’t been shown that they were ever raped . secondly , people will often site the fact that almost no accusers have ever been shown to be lying , and then will draw the conclusion that most accusers must be telling the truth . this obscures the fact that , in most cases , there is no proof that the accuser is lying or telling the truth , and so it gets thrown out due to a lack of evidence . this does n’t mean the accuser was lying or being honest , it just means there was n’t enough evidence to sentence anyone . thirdly , proponents of the movement will often use faulty logic and ad hominem attacks against anyone who disagrees . the last time i voiced my issues in real life , i was attacked for defending rapists and sexism . this , firstly , is a baseless attack . secondly , myself and anyone else against #metoo , for the most part , are actually defending people who are to be assumed innocent . we are n’t defending rapists because if they were n’t proven guilty , we do n’t consider them guilty . finally , the movement encourages people to jump to conclusions based on faulty evidence . if someone is kinda a jerk , holds a position of power , and/or has any sort of personality flaw , this will be used by #metoo members as “ proof ” that they ’re a rapist . just because someone is mean or rude does n’t make them a rapist , even if their traits are negative . someone can even be sexist without also being a rapist . tl ; dr : the #metoo movement is dangerous . it uses the term survivor to hide the fact that it always assumes the accused is indeed a rapist . it misuses statistics to claim that most accused people are guilty . it attacks any detractors by claiming they support rapists , because , again , it assumes the accused are guilty . it equates negative personality traits with proof that the person is a rapist .","people do n't generally use "" proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt "" as their standard in everyday life , or really in any situation except in a courtroom . for example , if your coworker says "" i saw todd sneaking some fries out of your lunch order "" , you probably believe him and probably do n't go check security cam footage and get witness statements to prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt . this means that when people start talking about guilt beyond a reasonable doubt in certain circumstances , it very much looks like a conscious choice ; they are choosing to put aside their normal pattern-recognition behavior in favor of a very strict legal standard . and when people make this conscious decision for very specific things , like when men are accused of sexual assault by women , it looks a little bit like they 're going out of their way to defend people accused of sexual assault . obvious example , look at the bill cosby trial ; people were defending him before the guilty verdict even though his statements all-but-admitted he used quaaludes to rape women , and were specifically bringing up "" guilt beyond a reasonable doubt "" and the fact there was n't a verdict yet as defenses . they were essentially shifting all responsibility for pattern recognition and judgment onto the court system and then attacking people who drew the ( obvious ) conclusion cosby was a rapist . do you have any examples of somebody brought down by the #metoo movement for their behavior without an accusation of sexual assault or harassment ? should a private company be forced to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that an employee committed an act of sexual harassment for the company to fire that person ? so is kavanaugh your principal example of someone about whom it was said "" he 's a jerk , so he obviously raped somebody ? "" it seems to me that most people are taking the accusation as evidence of someone 's jerk-hood , not necessarily their jerk-hood as proof that the accusation is well-founded ."
a01dh4,"we do not have any obligation to intervene if we see suffering . disclaimer : english is not my first language , so if you can not understand something let me know . while i did try to make sure everything sounded right , mistakes do happen . i also tried to use american-focused examples in my claim . suffering is very common in the world , and is actually an important part of human development . having people help themselves creates personal growth and instills self-reliance . if everything was done for a child , they would never know how to do things for themselves . for centuries , humans have become more adept at facing daily or extraordinary challenges from the motivation brought to us via suffering . ethiopia , which has received a large amount of foreign aid , still has a very weak economy for most of its citizens . while the people are adept at surviving , the country 's economy is not . another reason for this is that if we intervene in someone else 's suffering , or the suffering of another group , we could also suffer from that . sending troops to ground zero in a war scenario could just create more deaths . most of the time , intervening is not worth the cost , both in effort and in human lives . from the united state 's department of defense ( -- url -- ) : there have been 2.372 us military deaths in the war afghanistan . on 2001-09-11 , 2.996 americans died . this does not seem to match the cost of death . furthermore , by "" helping "" individuals can feel a sense of accomplishment , when they really did not do anything at all . this tricks people into believing that the problem is being solved , when nothing is being done about it ; it actually makes the scenario worse . helping others or intervening in today 's world is often in small measure . sending out a tweet with a hashtag in response to a tragedy gives the idea of change , when this view is actually False . to give another example , when the rwandan genocide occurred , the un sent troops . the soldiers did very little to help the people , but in the world 's eyes , positive change was taking place . this allowed us to ignore the genocide , which had a negative affect . just because we have the ability to make a situation better , does not mean the situation will actually improve . another example for this is the #thoughtsandprayers "" movement "" . in response to numerous us shootings , people tweeted their "" support "" , showing that they would give their thoughts and prayers . this allowed them to believe that they were helping , when they actually were not . this did not help the victims , and made things worse . like i wrote earlier , just because we have the ability to make a situation better , does not mean the situation will actually improve . if we try to help from a perceived obligation , then we can actually make things worse . in conclusion , we do not have an obligation to help others in suffering as it can make the situation worse , by instilling a reliance on others . it also is n't usually worth it in the cost of lives , and attempting to help others when not much is being done can make people think they help , but they are not .","the reason you do n't see countries getting a lot of aid developing is because that aid is either taken by the corrupt or offered in the form of food/cash and not infrastructure and training . if you look at studies where education or infrastructure is given , the impact is very good . for the thoughtsandprayers point , that is n't support , or intervention in any way . i think there 's a huge difference between helping people out in a famine or a genocide and raising your kids . you do n't starve your kids , sell them into slavery , or mutilate their bodies to ' teach ' them to improve themselves through suffering . however , these specific instances do n't relate to your moral claim that there is no obligation to intervene in situations of suffering . every single instance of help could be a failure and we could still have a moral obligation to intervene in suffering . in general , the reason for the moral obligation is that if someone is suffering , they need help , and if everyone gives help to the suffering , that person will receive help . it does seem though like you 're talking specifically about war/famine interventions . generally , if a state intervenes militarily in another state , that state has something to gain from it . the us invaded afghanistan not out of a moral obligation , but to secure oil resources . aid is offered to developing countries in exchange for influence , mineral rights , etc . i think as humans though that we should help the suffering . if you live in a country where some warlord is rampaging around killing everyone , no matter how much you improve yourself , you ca n't stop that on your own . for aid to developing countries , there 's a reason they 're developing , which is previous exploitation by the countries that are now helping them . look further into the effects of colonialism and the benefits of uplifting developing countries to the world market ."
a012yp,"for the sake of preventing a society in which blacks are seen as outgroupe - people , even if they look white , should identity with their ethnic backgrounds as opposed to skin tone . especially in america , there seems to be a lot of controversy about people who look white and when those people identity as something else . i understand how it ’s silly if someone identifies as something completely left field if they have genetic background to back it up , but maybe this racial dysphoria would n’t exist if there distinct identities allowed to be acknowledged through cultural background as opposed to just saying “ i ’m white ” today ’s racial tension is kinda confusing too . especially when there are people who racist towards hispanics when even said hispanic is white . or maybe they hate jews , even if said jewish person is white . it ’s just pretty confusing . considering mixed people black + white people such as famous pop singer halsey identify as black when people who are italian and arab identity as white . or when a seemingly white person is actually native american . i ’ve seen italians and puerto ricans not identify as white when others have personally identified them as white . this also feeds a sort of ethnic/cultural erasure . for example if someone who looked white was half japanese/half white was supposed to only identity as white , why would they acknowledge their japanese heritage ? speaking of asians . there ’s many articles on google talking about most asians essentially worship white people . it ’s implied by society that white people generally feel a certain way about black people , which most likely means that asian people would feel a similar way . to me it seems that only latinos and italians ( who live in italy ) identity more with their cultural heritage than their skin tone , and as a result experience less racial tension than the us does . if all physically white people only identified as white , including physically whites hispanics , and white people have asian people at their hip then this sort of creates a society where black people are the only outlier .","people already do what you 're describing when it comes up . but when were talking about black or white or brown were talking about the knee-jerk reactions that the majority of society ( that city , state , or the whole country ) has to a person who looks like that person . but regarding workplace descrimination against minorities , i 'm mexican because my maiden name sounded super hispanic so my resume was treated like other mexicans . if someone sees him , they wo n't feel less threatened if he says "" do n't worry , i 'm actually of indian descent , not african ! "" if they feel threatened , or if they descriminate against him , it 's because of his color , not his blood . and just to make a point , i ’m not talking about forgetting your heritage , i ’m talking about we are all humans , we were all born on earth . i think there 's a good deal of confusion on this because in everyday speech people often use the term white to stand for "" of european christian descent "" and black "" for of african descent "" . in reality its more of physical judgement based on skin tone and hair type . which is where you get confusion about se asian blacks or jewish vs white people . white , black , and brown are appearance descriptors and should stay that way , people should just be more honest about discussing geographic or ethnic heritage ."
a00uce,"i believe the nuking of japan was justified . i am not someone who is pro-war , but that 's why i 'm not against the nuking . it 's often put as one of the worst things america has done in their history , but knowing the number of war crimes japan was committing does n't make me very sympathetic . if you do n't know about the atrocities committed by japan during wwii , these are the most infamous : the rape of nanjing and unit 731 . i also believe that invading japan would have still resulted in the death of thousands on both sides . i 'm having trouble finding whether this is True , but i 've heard that japan refused to apologize when originally confronted . & #x200b ; i have come to this conclusion without any substantial discussion which is a flawed way to create political opinions . i understand the nuking has had lasting biological impacts and many innocent citizens were killed .","in fact , many argue that the war in japan was already won before the bombs were even drop . if a soldier shoots at you , does it justify killing women and children who live in the same town as the soldier ? but before they could realize what had happened , they were nuked again ( just three days later ) . if it was just a firebomb , once the country surrendered , the death would have immediately stopped instead of continuing on . the ussr entered the war against them , and the japanese knew they did n't have long , especially without any allies . people described the japanese as crazy people who would stop at nothing and would fight to the death or commit suicide . given that the second red scare started immediately after wwii ended , this makes sense . the final perspective is that mass murder of civilians is never justified under any circumstances . however , i do n't think you can argue that it is morally justified . in american politics during the war , the japanese people had been stereotyped and dehumanized to a degree that rivaled the cartoonish stereotypes of jews in nazi germany - they were frequently portrayed , in movies and popular media , as savages who deserved to die en masse . it would not be unreasonable to describe the dominant american attitude towards the japanese people as basically genocidal . as such , drooping the bomb was a satisfying way for americans to end the war , and the optics of this undoubtedly played a role in the decision to do so ."
a00s4r,"diversity of skin colour , sexuality and backgrounds etc , is fine but multi-culturalism is n't . i 'm not talking culture in the sense of the indian family having a curry shop down the road , i mean in the sense of having a primitive culture which changes the way you behave towards other members of a society or conduct yourself within that society . for example the influx of migrants into paris has forced the government to install public urinals because they are used to urinating in the street , or needing to put refugees through mandatory lessons on norwegian values in norway so that they know how to treat women . a lot of people seem to celebrate the influx of migrants as an introduction of new culture when it clearly has many inferior facets which damage the society it takes root in . multi-culturalism seems to be used as a word to celebrate people refusing to integrate , furthermore even if multi-culturalism did n't cause tensions in communities it would still be undesirable since it damages the culture ( i 'm talking in the sense of food and traditions here but only in the case where a very large group moves over and does n't integrate ) in the area it happens in . if i go to germany i want to experience german culture ( food , entertainment and customs etc. ) not eritrean , pakistani or indian . not to bash those cultures or anything it 's that i prefer there to be uniqueness in where i travel .","next you 'll be an old man worrying over how the young people are running the culture when it was inevitable that they 'd change the culture anyway . with that basis , i think it is most fair to ask whether multiculturalism is inherently harmful in a society that , given the conditions that the cultures forming the "" multi "" part of multiculturalism are not part of the dominant culture of a country ? take for example the historical example of mexico : after the mexican revolution , there was for a short time a large growth in the music and arts of the country with the politics of the nation being encouraged to support that culture . this shows how politics can allows for a culture , but is still distinct . another example can be found in many european countries - the allowance in these countries , say france , the united kingdom , spain , and others of women and non-whites to vote has not drastically , if at all , affected the significant facets of these countries ' cultures that make those cultures unique . now , to address your first harm that i listed with this in mind , it seems clear that the change of legal systems , and learning to live within a new legal system is not inherently going to force assimilation , and even if it does , it is n't a harm of multiculturalism . and it is also worth noting that the defining aspects of that culture are n't destroyed either - the music , arts , manners , word connotations are still allowed and can evolve naturally over time . but i would argue that it is exactly uniqueness , and the distinctions between cultures that nonetheless coexist within the same geographical that defines a multicultural society . with that in mind , if the harms you described by loss of uniqueness , such as "" ( i 'm talking in the sense of food and traditions here but only in the case where a very large group moves over and does n't integrate ) "" which then leads to the dilution of both that culture and the culture of the place they moved into , actually happen , then by definition his is not the result of multiculturalism , but the result of assimilation . that is to say , a multicultural society would celebrate the difference between cultures , while avoiding assimilation and appropriation . but that 's a new distinct culture that people native to that region will be born into - other cultures can still be distinct , and not lose their uniqueness . thus , all multiculturalism truly does is enable one to experience different cultures , different foods , and perhaps more impactfully , different perspectives , all without losing sight of ones roots ."

a00bpk,"it should be illegal to smoke in public , even outdoors . it ’s honestly a really disruptive habit , and it is n’t good for the people smoking or the other people having to breathe it in . i do n’t think it would stop people from smoking in their own private spaces , and it should n’t . people can do what they want in their own private spaces . smoke is n’t something you can just “ keep to yourself ” in public . it blows over to other people , and smells terrible . the places where smoking has been banned are so much more pleasant to be in , since there is never that person who walks right up next to you and starts smoking , ruining the previously fresh outdoor air . i want to see if there are actually any good reasons against making it illegal everywhere in public , other than “ i smoke and i want it to be legal . ”","but most place even cater to your paranoia making it illegal to smoke within 25 feet of the door of an establishment , unless it is specifically designated for smoking such as some bars . when it comes to smoking , there is a lot of scientific data suggesting that second hand smoke is harmful to non-smokers while in an indoor space , so i 'm completely fine with making smoking illegal inside of bars , etc . if that ’s the case , you would have to ban smoking weed , vaping , juuling , or anything of the sort in public as well . - second hand smoke studies are based on indoor exposure not outdoor because you cant possibly do a study on outdoor exposure . even indoor exposure , per second hand smoke studies , is barely significant . - anti-smoking advocates often argue as if the existence of any effect on health , no matter how small , justifies any smoking ban no matter how extensive . if the size and certainty of alleged health risks are irrelevant , then of course the case for smoking bans is easy to make : most nonsmokers find smoking inconvenient and have little regard for the smoking minority ’s preferences . setting such a low bar provides a convenient excuse for expanding the boundaries of the smoke-free world ever outward . the relevant question , however , should not be merely whether there are any dangers from secondhand smoke but also how big they are . if the alarmist claims made by anti-smoking groups were True , we ’d be justified in avoiding secondhand smoke as if it were the plague . most fundamentally , the debate about smoking bans should center on private property rights . whether you should be allowed to smoke in a bar should be determined by the owner of that bar , not by busybody bureaucrats who think they know how to live everyone ’s lives for them . in 2013 already there were indications that the commonly accepted narrative on second-hand smoke was n't entirely accurate . the journal of the national cancer institute ( which the below-mentioned slate article calls "" hardly a pro-tobacco publication "" ) published a study which finds no significant relationship between passive smoke and cancer : "" a large prospective cohort study of more than 76,000 women confirmed a strong association between cigarette smoking and lung cancer but found no link between the disease and secondhand smoke . "" an immensely informative article by jacob grier in slate finally sorted through the questionable "" proof "" behind the second-hand smoke myth . the bans had largely been implemented because early studies believed there to be a correlation between secondhand smoke and heart disease . in fact , grier reveals that a 2006 study in the piedmont region in italy ( published in the european heart journal ) revealed an 11 percent drop in heart disease , a much smaller drop than the 60 percent that politicians had promised . after a sweeping ban on smoking inside in england , a 2010 study found a heart attack reduction of only 2 percent . a 2008 study in new zealand found no correlation whatsoever . the journal of policy analysis and management published a study in 2010 that also found no significant impact in any age group . data in france ( which implemented its smoking ban in 2008 ) shows that consumption of tobacco products only correlates with prices . why not make perfume , body odor , grilling outdoors , eating canned tuna and driving illegal because some people find their smells unpleasant ? second hand smoke in an outside area is such a non issue i will leave that alone . taking away someone ’s ability to smoke outside is an imposition on a pretty basic concept of public land ."
9zzvt6,"the first step to reforming the american political/governmental system is thoroughly defining a new one . decrying the state of american politics is nearly pointless unless you simultaneously back , affirm , or propose a wholly new approach . as john lennon sang in ‘ revolution ’ , “ you say you got a real solution . well , you know , we ’d all love to see the plan . ” putting down the current state of affairs and structure is easy . but as one of the more arguably “ successful ” systems of last 200 + years , an alternative to a constitutional republic with bicameral representation and three quasi-independent branches would need a clear and elegantly-composed framework — one both the masses and the intellectuals could understand and back . we live in a hopelessly broken system that , combined with media influence ( mainstream , alt , and social ) , facilitates fracture . something needs to be done , and the next step is new founding documents .","i hate to be pedantic about this be it seems like the first step is identifying the problem notnpropsong a solution . for example , in the history of the current us government , the first "" document "" we have is the declaration of independence . that 's not a ' founding document ' the way that the articles of confederacy or the constitution are . and , even then to get that document written and signed , there had to be a bunch of rich and powerful people who were unhappy enough with the english government to form the first continental congress , and confident enough in their ability to do better to set out on their own . in that case the puritans had a consensus that they wanted to establish a theocracy and were powerful enough to push it on the ' strangers . ' ) all types of people , from journalists to politicians to academics to pundits have defined various systems for running things . some were poorly thought out , with huge flaws or things that most people do not support making them deeply foolhardy . but others were pretty fleshed out , nuanced ideas , a whole conceptual structure for how things could be changed and improved . some were well thought out systems that more or less tweaked things , creating a more accessible path to a third party , ending gerrymandering , etc . others were radical changes , from a far more socialistic state to a libertarian one , but even many of these were well thought out , internally logical , and had a rational appeal in the real world . the trouble is , even if we could make small changes well going against the entrenched interests that do not want such change , or convince a majority of people to make radical change , we can not come anywhere near agreeing on what that change should be . the issue is not that we do not have a rational conceptual idea that accounts for the more granular issues . the trouble is we have dozens if not hundreds of such proposed systems , all built on philosophical foundations we have been arguing about for centuries , and we can not come to any agreement as a society on a short list of more serious contenders , let alone pick one . we ca n't even "" fix "" or agree on any single issue because everything is so polarized there needs to be a "" middle "" but no one can agree because both sides are polar opposites if the left had their way , we would have a billion or 2 people flooding the us in an uncontrolled fashion and eventually our entire country will collapse under the financial strain of keeping these people alive the "" middle "" in my opinion and the only sensible solution i am able to come up with that could possibly work is to stop the bleeding and catch up with the backlog while writing new laws that both sides can agree on currently , the way we are handling immigration is like the old story where you have a hole in the boat and you 're tossing buckets overboard to stay afloat to fix the boat , eventually you need to plug the hole close the "" hole "" / shut down the boarder and all immigration until everything is caught up through the courts americans are fed up with the us versus them mentality of our politics , but our public officials are complicit in allowing it to continue . they actively smear third wing candidates , together , in an attempt to maintain the two-party system . the second thing we need to fix our government is congressional term limits . so basically the one thing our two parties can agree on is 1 ) no to term limits and 2 ) no to a new major party . and in order to fix that , i think its going to need the american people to realize that the above issues are what 's causing the dysfunction in our government . our government documents are fine the way they are , and all the changes i mentioned above can be done with the current laws in place . tldr revolutions are a lot more difficult and involved then just reforming the current system . before deciding whether to reform existing systems or create a new system , you have to articulate what is wrong in our current system . if we start revolution and attempt to build a new system , there is no way to ensure the powerful do n't end up at the top . in fact , the most powerful tend do alright during times of political upheaval . finally , the current system and the people who benefit from it do n't want something new . so your revolution would quickly be branded a terrorist cell and the us government along with key allies are going to throw everything they have at you and your revolutionary movement . so we can not decide on how much taxes rich people should pay . people still have to decide and agree how much taxes rich people should pay with the current or any new system ."

9zxczl,"torture is sometimes acceptable when you so badly need an information , and getting that information would prevent a worse crime , it is morally acceptable to torture . i would say that all three circumstances must be satisfied : if there is compelling evidence someone knows an information . if they are voluntarily withholding this information . if this information is vital in investigating or preventing a very serious crime such as murder , rape , crimes agains humanity or crimes against children . if the information is verifiable and falsifiable after the confession . for example : if the police captures a mafioso and they are sure he knows where 's the hideout of a mafia boss responsible for a mass killing , i really see no moral problem with waterboarding him until he speaks .","well right off the bat you 're allowing the torture of innocent people because "" compelling evidence "" is n't a very high bar to meet . turns out when you put people in severe pain , they 'll tell you whatever you want to hear to make it stop , even if it is n't True . torture is an unreliable method of extracting information as the torture victim is likely to tell you anything to make the torture stop . you also run into the issue of the constitution as well as other governing treaties explicitly forbidding “ cruel and unusual punishment ” so therefore , at the very least , torture is unconstitutional . in some cases , the torture victim may not have actually been convicted of any crime and thus it would just be the government inflicting bodily harm against an innocent person . the problem is that torture is notoriously unreliable for extracting wholly accurate and actionable information . people will say whatever they can to make the torture stop . and even if they do n't , whatever someone says under torture will have to be treated skeptically , as though it were made up . so even if someone was to provide 100 % accurate information , whatever time might be saved by torturing someone instead of taking a more measured and proven-effective approach will have to be spent running down secondary sources and cross-checking to verify what was told under torture conditions . torture immediately throws the accuracy of any information obtained into question . if the justification of using torture is to extract information that can be acted on quickly / in an emergency , then the problem is that such information ca n't be trusted ( as you note yourself in your fourth point : if the information is verifiable and falsifiable after the confession ) and has to be verified . in other words , even within your own set of criteria , your main justification for using torture ( time-sensitive need for action ) is nullified by the fact that you ca n't act immediately because you have to spend time verifying the accuracy of the information . person # 1 : if someone is trained & skilled at resisting , and willing to do anything , including die for the cause , you will not get information out of them , and certainly not real information . they will either deny they know anything or give you False info . person # 2 : if someone is not trained & skilled at resistance , and they know the info , they might tell you the truth or lie to you to make you stop , even if temporarily . sometimes you might get truth out of them and other times you wo n't . and once they do n't know the additional info you keep torturing them for , they turn into person # 3 . person # 3 : if someone is not trained & skilled , and is not fully committed to the cause , and does n't have the info you want . but then you will keep torturing an innocent person and they will keep giving you the False info they think you want . person 4 : trained & skilled , committed , and does n't know the info . they might stick to the truth that they do n't have the info that you want , in which case you will just keep torturing an innocent person . or they might end up giving you False information eventually , for temporary reprieve from the torture . plus consider the fact that police get lots of False confessions out of innocent people , even without using torture . so , think about how much False information you would get with torture . so , you would be torturing innocent people and guilty people and having a very hard time knowing who is who , and getting lots of False information either out of trickery or out of desperation . we ca n't trust any information given under torture , people who may know nothing may give incorrect information just to end the torture ."
9zw7ad,"proudly displaying a portrait of the queen in your living room is not a symbol of australian patriotism my brother is a staunch monarchist . he is going to an event in a few days where he will meet our local representative to the australian house of representatives to ask for a portrait of the queen . i 'm not kidding : members of the australian house of representatives really are required to give out free portraits of the queen if requested ( hint : hardly anyone ever requests these ) . his rationale for this is : > patriotic americans fly the american flag in front of their house to show off their patriotism . why ca n't i show off my patriotism by requesting a portrait of the queen and displaying it in our living room ? in contrast , i am a republican ( by that , i mean that i support the idea of republicanism in australia ) . these are my views on this topic : if you want to show off how patriotic you are , putting up portraits of a non-australian citizen is the exact opposite way to go . i also oppose personality cults and dynastic politics ( and a de jure royal dynasty does n't stop de facto dynasties of politicians ) . some australians would even say that monarchism is inherently un-australian , going against the australian belief in a "" fair go "" . i believe that it 's understandable why patriotic americans fly the american flag in front of their house : because it 's their nation 's flag , not that of another nation , and it 's completely separate from personality cults and dynasties . however , since lots of people accuse me of closed-mindedness , i need to prove that accusation wrong by opening my mind to the opposing arguments . therefore : why should i consider the queen ( elizabeth ii , queen of the united kingdom and the other commonwealth realms ) as a symbol of australian patriotism ? why should i support dynastic monarchism and a personality cult ?","that means she is the queen of australia and it is fully patriotic to honor her . in fact it is unpatriotic to not honor her as she is your head of state , and commander-in-chief of your armed forces . i would say for the first bullet point : patriotism is showing support for ones country . if the queen is basically the face of the government , would n’t having a picture of her show your support ( patriotism ) ? you do not choose to see the queen as a patriotic symbol because you do n’t believe in the personality cults and dynasties . since we both technically are constitutional monarchies and we share the same queen which is technically our leader , well having pictures of her is patriotic by definition . i think your brother can support the queen and feel that is patriotic , and you could have a differing opinion and fly whatever flag a republicanism in australia person would fly . i agree that we should resist a national narrative that centres an individual as the principle power of the country , where the most extreme examples can be seen in authoritarian regimes that will use cult of personality strategies to deify the leader . that is not , however , what is happening in the uk and the queen does not represent a cult of personality . first of all , cult of personality is a power welding technique used to convince a population that the person in power is uniquely and unquestionably powerful/capable as to make them essential and beyond fault . if you 've ever seen a uk tabloid , you know that the queen is hardly above criticism and there are legal parties whose entire platform is republicanism that would see her unseated as head of state . so the uk and commonwealth ( canadian here ) is not suffering from a cult of personality problem with the queen . second , while she is not a cult of personality figure , the queen is the current head of a hereditary monarch which was based on the concept that god selected a family to rule . while that was problematic in the past , the windsor family does not presume a religious right to rule anymore despite being the head of the church of england . constitutional monarchy means the seat of power is parliament and the crown simply annoints that seat to represent the kingdom . parliaments represents the country ; the queen represents the people that make up the british nation ( which includes canadians and australians , among others ) . i 'm not saying monarchism is great , but it is a traditional foundation of a national identity that is shared within the commonwealth . i do n't think it 's particularly patriotic to display the queen 's portrait , but it is a symbol of national identity and appreciation of a traditional system that is comforting to many ."
9zvmb2,"blaming ' white people ' for a racist climate is both counter productive and historically simplistic - i think that categorizing any group of people based on their ethnic background can lead to many forms of generalization that could lead to stigmatization ; the more stigma , the more division , the less likely it is that people will stop paying attention to ethnicity - people will often say that colonization was a result of white supremacy ; but is n't it the opposite ? colonialists were motivated by greed and power , and used the stigmatisation of foreign populations to justify their inhumane actions . think of it the same way hitler raised the masses against the jewish and the gipsies before the holocaust ; dehumanize and vilify a cotagory of humans for your own interest and never have anyone oppose your decision to treat them like cattle . - this is very anecdotal , but maybe i should mention that i 'm an arabic living in north-america , so i 've experienced racism in many different forms","the reason white people are blamed for racist climates ( depending on the setting ) is mostly because they 're the ones that introduced that racist climate . in reference to colonization , domination of one group over another has been a human trait for ages . the problem however is in the manner that they did it . their colonial expansion introduced a highly racialized climate , thus it only makes sense that they would be blamed for the existence of that climate you may be right that greed was usually the driver and racism the rationalization , even though at all points in history we can find what seem to be very strident , apparently sincere ideological racists . i think saying that minorities “ blame ” white people for this climate is an oversimplification . i think minorities ( mainly black people ) are just frustrated at the half-baked attempts of white people trying to repair the damage done by their ancestors and assuming that those measures have now made everyone equal all of sudden when that is far from the truth . black people and minorities do n’t blame white people for the racist climate . they blame white people for choosing to ignore the fact that it has not left and will in all likely never leave . prejudice exists everywhere but black people are targeted the most in america because they ’re seen in certain ways due to circumstances not in their control ."
9zveb9,"our government 's policy decisions should be formed by a supercomputer and panel of experts i know this might sound crazy or dystopian or skynet-esque , but let me explain . from what i understand of our current system , the majority of policy is driven ( or is supposed to be driven ) by a thing called the "" iron triangle "" - that is legislative committees , lobbyists , and executive agencies . i think our current administration , and plenty of examples from previous administrations , show how this system can become deeply flawed due to a few big factors : 1 . career politicians concerned more with re-election than policymaking , or concerned more with "" pork barrel "" spending than with big-picture solutions 2 . corporate lobbyists that hold way more power than they should , due to the disproportionate effect of money on politics ( through donations , bribes , whatever you want to call them ) . some have suggested perhaps simpler solutions to these problems in the form of term limits , donation limits , etc. but i thought why not take it a step further and aim for policymaking that is purely objective and scientific in execution . basically my idea is this : the executive branch of the government would be composed primarily of a very powerful supercomputer ( likely much more powerful than anything we have today , although the same effect could be achieved by several computers working together ) , and a panel of scientific/economic experts and computer technicians who oversee the operation of the computer , and pass on its results to the actual legislators/executive agencies . you would start with a broad policy objective and its necessary constraints . ( for example - you want to develop the healthcare system that covers the most people , with certain constraints regarding cost , number of hospitals , etc. ) the supercomputer would take some input parameters and generate a number of scenarios ( these could be submitted by humans , or auto-generated ) . it then simulates each of these scenarios for some given period of time , using a model that is kept as accurate as possible . probably the simulation would seek to minimize/maximize a cost function to get the result desired . once the computer determines a result , it passes to a board of experts ( for healthcare , this would be medical scientists , doctors , pharmacists , economists , etc. ) for initial review . it could then go to an ethics board for final review . once approved , the plan would go directly to the legislative . ideally , this would be a rubber-stamp process with no amendments/riders since those would need to go back to expert review . addressing concerns : 1 . security . the physical computer ( s ) could be air-gapped . software/data would be installed manually by technicians . the supercomputer 's core software and any additional libraries , simulation code , etc. would be open-source and freely viewable on an external repository that is continuously monitored and verified . the computer would periodically verify the integrity of its source code by comparing to the remote repository ( i guess manually since it 's air-gapped ) . maybe changes to the source code could use a blockchain for security . 2 . where did democracy go ? many people are probably concerned that the system could be quickly overrun by corrupt individuals . i have tried to think of precautions for this . first , the technical experts appointed to policy review boards can be approved by elected legislators , or by some system based on academia ( the nation 's universities ) . as for the computer 's code itself , there is n't really an opportunity for corruption because it 's all open-source and any software engineer experienced with machine learning algorithms could parse it and raise any red flags . periodically , the government would hold "" contests "" for citizens to submit modifications/updates/improvements to the supercomputer 's source code . these would be open to anyone , and the code would be reviewed by an independent panel of experts ( likely from academia ) . note : i am not a software/computer engineer and i have only a basic understanding of computer security . any input from professionals is appreciated , hence why i am here .","supercomputers are just highly specialized computers with a lot of processing power compared to other computers . imagine your computer with 1000x the processing speed ; this is a supercomputer . to put this further into perspective , in the 1970s your phone would be considered a supercomputer because it has far better processing power than pretty much any computer we had in that time period . i mention this because i 'm not sure how a powerful computer like this plays into your view . computers are useful tools , but they do n't make decisions on their own . you can program them , tell them the parameters you want them to care about , and have them "" make a decision "" based on this input , but they 're still only considering the variables you tell them to . worse yet , if you wanted to slant the computer so that it would say "" yes "" to a certain proposal -- any proposal -- this would be very easy to do as a researcher . companies would have a huge interest in trying to bribe researchers with grants and other gifts , and without a substantial check and balance on the power of this committee , the super computer in your example could essentially become a magic box that researchers plug values into that they know will give them the answer they want on any question they ask , resulting in them getting the legislation they want passed , even if this legislation is totally unethical or inefficient . unfortunately , this is also a sort of attack which would be impossible to diagnose without being super involved , because to a computer or a technician the computer would appear to be running properly . for example amazon 's hiring ai that did n't want to hire any women and the prison sentencing ai that was giving black people longer sentences . computers are not independent entities , they are extensions of the people who programmed them . the opinions of the people who code the ai will become the opinions of the ai . as things stand today , anyone can run for office and have a chance to be involved in the decisions made at any governmental level ."
9zr7l6,"putting everything out into the open will make people more honest this idea that putting everything out into the open will make people more honest is also known as “ radical transparency . ” i think that radical transparency is necessary in order to have a more open dialogue between differing parties . if everyone were to be more open , and in turn , more honest , there would be less government abuse , corporate abuse / manipulation , and cyberbullying / meanness . principal researcher at microsoft , danah boyd , quantifies these claims throughout her multiple reports . by putting everything into the open , people would be able to be more honest to their peers . while people value their privacy and anonymity online , they still have the opportunity to be transparent . in fact , it is easier to be transparent on the internet as you do not have to reveal your identity to do so . transparency has value when the powerless try to undermine the powerful .","you mentioned transparency having value , but journalists who expose things are often killed . i do n't think playing a game like poker that emphasizes bluffing makes people less honest in real life . i do n't think playing games that value honesty make people more honest in real life . in the same way , radical transparency is just a new form of office politics to negotiate around . so in a place where no one lies , you can gain an advantage by telling lies . in a place where many people lie , you can gain an advantage by being dishonest . in a place where there is radical transparency , you can gain an advantage by selectively telling the truth and using lies of omission . ultimately , we can redefine the rules of an office or world as much as we want . radical transparency changes the strategy of how people act , but it does n't change the underpinnings of office life . the thing with radical transparency ( in relationships ) is the constant awareness of each person that the other person may use your personal info to manipulate you emotionally . i 'm an incredibly direct person , and it definitely takes a certain kind of personality to handle such vulnerability . the government and many corporations know your every move , and will punish you if you step out of line . they just introduced a system that makes everything even more transparent ."
9zo24w,"in the case of the american missionary murdered by the sentinelese in the andaman islands , the fisherman who took him there are not culpable for anyone unfamiliar with the case i ’m referring to , here is a link to an article on india today north sentinel island , and the tribe who inhabit it , the sentinelese , are protected by the indian government as ‘ uncontacted ’ . it is illegal to travel within 3 miles of the island . the tribe themselves are not subject to indian law and can not be arrested . these restrictions are intended to protect both parties : outsiders due to the history of violence and attacks those entering the island have been subjected to , and the tribe themself due to the risk of outsiders spreading disease to this extremely isolated and therefore vulnerable population . this position is in itself an ethical grey area , with some making counter - arguments that these people could benefit from development . ( as an aside , i find myself conflicted about all of this - is it hegemonic and paternalistic to impose another way of living on them , or is it irresponsible to deny the possibility of positive , well-planned contact that could help ensure their longer term survival ? ) but to get back to this recent case , the american missionary allegedly paid some fisherman from a neighboring island $ 350 to take him to north sentinel island . he ’d researched the tribe thoroughly for years beforehand and evidence suggests he was well aware of the dangers , but he apparently had such a strong conviction about spreading the word of jesus to them that he was willing to take the risk . maybe because i ’m not religious and i struggle to justify evangelical behavior , but i find his position stupidly misguided and arrogant in the extreme : entirely indefensible on moral grounds given the risk his contact posed to the people he aimed to help ‘ save ’ . now to get to the point i want to debate , in the case of the fisherman who have now been arrested in connection with his murder , i do not agree that they are guilty of anything beyond illegally entering a restricted area . they apparently warned the man of the dangers but he said he wanted to go anyway . like a cab driver taking a naive tourist into a gangland , i do n’t believe they are culpable for the consequences . yes , they knew he risked death , and they likely also knew he could have wiped out the tribe by spreading disease , but to me , they were simply responding to market forces ; it ’s not their place to be the moral arbiters of their client ’s actions . and why should they face harsher punishment than those who actually perpetrated the murder ? i feel like i have this all wrong - cmv !","i think it would be more akin to taking someone covered in infectious material to a “ clean zone ” where people have no immunity or signs of infection and dropping them off . it is illegal under international and indian law to go to the island . i am not sure about india , but i do know that many countries including the us have laws that make someone involved in a crime where a death has occurred culpable for that death as well as the crime . so since they are guilty of entering the restricted area , and a murder occurred during that violation under many countries ' laws they are culpable for that murder ."
9zk4pl,"people trying to change their race are no different from people trying to change their gender why are "" transracial "" people treated with unabashed hate and claims of appropriation from the left , whereas mtf transgender people are given only love and acceptance from the left ? some background : i am a young , white male with a centre-left worldview in an urban area . i respect everyone regardless of their race or gender . i 'm lucky to be friends with many women , and even several transgender folk ( mtf , ftm , and nonbinary ) . but i do admit that just by virtue of growing up in and occupying almost entirely white spaces , i 've never been great friends with any black people . i would love to get some opinions from people who are not just on the outside looking in here . so , the problem is that , to me , a lot of parallels can be drawn between black people and women . both are groups that have been historically oppressed by society , and have had to fight for their rights -- the right to vote , for equal pay , against segregation , etc . of course , black people were literally slaves for hundreds of years , but the role of women in society has been marginalized for arguably longer in similar ways , as well . there are also many terrible names that both have been called i will not repeat here , and many of each have not been believed when they said injustices were being done to them . i would say that the world is , overall , becoming a more equal place every day , but the disadvantages of being either black or a woman in today 's world still remain . why then , is it acceptable for a man to decide he is a woman and to start changing his appearance to look like one , but it is unacceptable for a white person to decide they 're a black person and start to do the same ? why is n't the trans woman accused of "" appropriating female culture "" , or something ? of course , trans women will never feel the awkwardness or pain of menstruation , or of having to worry about getting pregnant . taking medication to transition will definitely be a process , but it is nowhere near the experience of changing too quickly or not quickly enough compared to your peers , and getting teased about it by a much more immature group . trans women are women , but they have n't lived the experiences of cisgender women . in a similar way , of course a white person who becomes black will not know blackness in the way a person who was black from birth does , but are n't they still free to be black people if they want to be ? to make it clear , i am not talking about people who put on blackface for a day and make fun of black people , in the same way when i say "" trans women "" , i 'm not talking about people who dress up as women for a day to make fun of them . i am referring to people like rachel dolazel , who has said in interviews that she has felt from a very young age like she was meant to be black , in much the same way trans people describe that they were meant to be born the other gender . i am also talking about the women in this twitter thread , who all at least seem to be more happy being black than the race they were born with . this one struck me the most , because this girl says a lot of things that many people say before they decide to transition . of course , you could argue that rachel dolazel and all these women are just doing it as a phase , and it 's appropriation because they could just drop being black very quickly and assimilate back into the white world , but is n't it not right to just assume that ? and really , any trans woman who does n't get bottom surgery and does n't take a lot of estrogen can easily transition to being a man again if they feel differently in the future , but you do n't see many doing that , right ? to end , i just want to say that "" transracial "" people do feel wrong to me in a way that transgender people do n't . thinking that i should respect them as their chosen race makes me feel icky . but logically , i know i originally felt this way about transgender people when i first heard about them , and the problem is that when i think about it , i can not logically find a "" thing "" that makes "" transracial "" people and transgender people two very different beasts , and part of me feels that if i do n't respect the former , i might as well be a terf because they really are so similar . reddit , please help me here , i 've felt conflicted about this for a very long time .","contrast that with african-americans who still retain some of their african ancestry , but would largely come across as foreign to african cultures . there is a long history of trans and gender nonconforming people going back centuries , with people engaging in social transition even in times when , for instance , being seen as a woman , would significantly make life harder . people were prepared to risk their lives to live as themselves . the phenomenon of "" being a black person in a white body "" only started happening when certain kinds of social capital in certain communities could be gained by presenting as a person of colour and voicing the struggles associated with it . transracial people are , at best , dealing with some other issue . dolezal came from a family where her parents had adopted several black children who may have been treated differently to her . transgender people typically display neurological patterns more like their actual/target gender ( before medical transition ) than their assigned gender , their brains literally are that way . as a term , transracial existed before dolezal and company and referred to adoption of a child from a different race , usually in the context of academic literature and support groups focused on the challenges that can arise from the dissonance of that experience . i 'm going to take a slightly different tack to other people here : why do you think you need to approve or not approve of how transgender or transracial people live their lives ? why is there this perception that what these people do with their lives is anyone else 's business but their own ? besides jungleworn ’s points , there is scientific evidence that suggests being transgender has a physical basis . the population of transgender people is very small , but the amount of people identifying as “ transracial ” is probably in the range of 0-10 , and likely not seriously . there is no evidence that being transracial has any sort of basis in genetics or biology . when a trans person wants to transition , it 's because they hold a sincerely held belief that they were born in the wrong body . trans people suffer extreme emotional pain from their dysphoria which can usually only be solved by transitioning . in addition to this , there 's a wealth of information and proof for the existance of trans people in the scientific community . by contrast -- and i say this while fully admitting that i have n't really had a chance to study this idea of being "" transracial before "" -- a quick google search shows no evidence of "" trasracial "" people existing . do n't get me wrong here , this is n't necessarily proof that transracial do n't exist , but i can see why this does n't bode will with liberals ( perhaps especially liberals who care about transgender issues ) when : it is so easy to draws parallels between people who claim to be transracial and black face . it is so easy to interpret this as fetishization of black culture ( in this case where a white person has essentially come in , claimed that they are a part of black culture because they make themselves look black with makeup , while they themselves do n't suffer the discrimination that black people do and are n't a member of this culture themselves ) . it is so easy to caricaturize and make fun of , potentially delegitimizing the gains that transgendered people have found tooth and nail for if researchers start to research transracial people and conclude that such a thing does not exist . even after liberals began accepting and fighting for gay rights , support for transgender rights took a long time to take hold . support for transgender people is a fairly new , very controversial piece of politics . i ca n't claim to know what a transgender person would want -- i 'm not transgender -- but i know that even as somebody who is fairly liberal i 'm hesitant to start accepting "" transracial "" people without some serious evidence that such a condition really exists . to drive the point home , if we start accepting every phenomenon under the category of "" liberalism "" , this could hurt the limited trust people have for transgender people ( who , by contrast , are very well documents in scientific literature [ for lack of better term ] ) . people can be born with a male or female brain , but people are n't born with a white or black brain . the problem is that we do n't know if being "" transracial "" is a real thing , while there are decades of documented cases of transgender people that demonstrate that enabling them to live as their identified gender ( including gender reassignment in many cases ) is beneficial to their mental health , well-being , and social functioning , as this alleviates the distress they feel from the mismatch between their sex and gender assigned at birth . these are the reasons why we broadly accept trans identities . just because one can make an analogy with transgender people , does n't mean that people like rachel dolezal , who claim to be transracial are having an equivalent experience with race instead of gender , or that letting transracial persons live as their preferred race ( and modify their bodies ) , is going to be just as beneficial to their mental health and well-being , as letting people live as their experienced gender . if there really is such a thing as being transracial , it will need to be researched separately , to see what kinds of distress ( if any ) are involved , and which treatment or approach best serves their needs . one ca n't just conclude that because living as the identified gender works in the case of trans persons , it is therefore necessarily a good approach for alleged transracial persons as well . for all we know , someone like dolezal might be way better served by psychological treatment to accept their "" birth race "" ( the equivalent of which has not been shown to work for transgender . ) and if transracial people do n't experience any comparable distress like a dysphoria or other harm from the alleged racial mismatch , i do n't see why society should accept or support their identified race in the first place . black foreigners from africa and white foreigners from eastern europe have more in common with each other and could be considered one race and black / white americans could be considered one race if you compared behaviors . so race isnt really much other than behaviors and feelings about the world ."

( i do n't want this to be a discussion on the necessity of the military -- it 's about us citizens ' attitudes towards the military . )","i think it ’s just something that is overall good for the morale of people serving . i ’ll start by saying i just finished serving and i am never the type of person to expect people to thank me , in fact i hate when people do it and find it i comfortable . however , when you ’re overseas away from your family it is nice to feel like you are at least being appreciated by the people back home . even if those people are n’t in imminent danger or deployed , you start going down a dark path when you disregard respect for military members because for a lot of them that pride is what keeps them going . if we just disregard them then the high standards we as civilians hold them to and the standard they hold themselves to will drop . if our culture takes away that sense of pride for joining the military , then there wo n’t be as much pride for the people who join and do good things , which is usually the biggest motivating factor . especially since our department was one that sent firemen from new jersey to new york to help with 9/11 so theres a lot of lingering respect for that . i respect that they experienced terrible things that those of us that have never been in a kill or be killed situation can even imagine the impact of . we also fairly negligent , as a nation , supporting the health of veterans after they leave service . us citizens are very appreciative of the life threatening service related profession 's . i 'll agree "" thank you for your service "" is definitely military veteran related but america loves it 's first responders . i just do n't see people in the us going up to firefighters or surgeons and be like , "" thank you for your service "" . with a volunteer force someone who thinks they got the stuff told the country "" send me , i 'm your huckleberry "" . when people thank a military member for serving its like saying "" thank you because now i 'm not forced to go "" you can be called into service for valid reasons or for political stunts at any time . the military is outrageously expensive , and is frequently deployed for suspect reasons . it 's True , although they are part of the same military so i wo n't count them separately here . the us is set up to fight multiple theaters of war at the same time ( e.g. , europe , asia , and the middle east ) . the us has a very ambitious foreign policy goal of defending its borders , upholding international order , and promoting american interests abroad . it 's at least partially the reason why you can buy coke or eat at mcdonalds in every country . tl ; dr : serving in the military represents the worst and most honorable kind of public service , the us military is insanely effective , and the military allows the us to push its interests abroad . as such , it makes perfect sense for us citizens who indirectly benefit from the military to revere it . it also makes sense for people from other countries to dislike it or think it 's stupid . yeah there are laws that place some restrictions on what they can do - but in any other job you have much greater freedom that is undeniably legally supported that 's why i respect people in the military - for knowingly and willingly putting themselves in a place where they have to make those sacrifices instead of just appreciating the sacrifice , many people decided to go all the way to revering the military and veterans . however , doing this often causes a similar harm because they still treat the veteran as separate and possibly broken . once again , props are often separated , given almost magical status , then mistrusted , resented , and ignored in the end . as a european i sort of understand us patriotism and i wish old continent was more like us in that regard especially that us soldiers were protecting the freedom of western europe just 25 years ago and are now deployed in the east to protect most of the continent now from "" green men "" culturally , the founding of america is very much dependent on having as many men defending their homes and our country as possible . "" thank you for your service "" and the reverence of people like firefighters most certainly exists . where i work all firefighters , police officers , paramedics , and soldiers get either free or heavily discounted food and drink as a sign of thanks and respect . have you considered that being from europe , your country spends a miniscule on military defense and relies on the us to protect your freedom and way of life ?"

9zh781,"trump is going to make some sort of deal announcement with china at the g20 next week i 've been reading tons of opinion pieces and watch interviews from all over ( fbn , cnbc , bloomberg , wsj , scmp ... the list is endless ) . i think trump is setting the stage for his biggest win yet ..... getting china to fall in line .

9zh4kt,"demographic trends ensure that misogynistic conservative values will persist and dominate civilization social groups that hold misogynistic conservative values have far higher fertility rates than groups that do not hold misogynistic views . consequently , it is the social groups with misogynistic values that will propagate the most and perpetuate their beliefs . a low number of births per woman ( i.e. a low fertility rate ) is pretty much the inevitable result of values that respect women and their education . as soon as a woman becomes educated and has the power to exert control over her own fertility she will bear fewer children than her mother . show me a woman who has birthed eight children and i 'll show you a woman who lives in a patriarchal family and has no say in her own life . these demographic trends , which favor misogynistic values , will ultimately doom attempts to liberate women .","even if conservative groups are having more children , if they ca n't keep them as adults their numbers will not increase . sorry , are you making the extraordinary misogynistic claim that only a weak , patriarchal controlled woman would ever have the desire to have multiple children ? from what i can tell the evidence you 're using ( higher birth rates among conservative demographics ) has been True for most of the past century . and yet , over the past century , we see a trend away from misogyny , a trend towards more permissive attitudes , and a trend towards more empowerment for women . what do you think accounts for that trend over the last century , and do you think those factors would no longer apply ? the fact that you assert in the title that conservative views and anyone who holds them are inherently misogynistic . i 'll be sure to tell every conservative female member of my family , most of whom work/worked jobs or attend school and yet still plan to have kids , that they 're all sexists . you implying that a woman who chooses to be a mother must be unintelligent and brainwashed by "" the patriarchy "" and blindly follows orders of the men in her family is extremely sexist . you 're also ignoring the trends that have been going on for the last 100 + years for women . quite a hypocrite you are , calling half the planet misygynistic but at the same time holding misogynistic views . in fact , from a demographic perspective that you are so fond of , those women are better than you . children are essential for a functioning society ( that 's a demographic constant ) and any women that has children and raises them lovingly is a hero . your belief requires that people are stuck with the political beliefs they 're born into . i ca n't tell you how many people i go to college with that grew up in very conservative families but have become disenchanted with their families ' views , especially young women . there is no demographic trend whatsoever about more people becoming more misoginistic . also if your theory was correct , how would we ever have liberal countries that support women 's rights to begin with ? if your theory was True , countries would keep becoming increasingly misogynistic and patriarchal . however we have consistently observed that countries are becoming more respectfully or women . children 's views tend to be shaped by their friend , not parents . the women '' who become educated and have the power to exert control over their own fertility '' go onto dominate the child care services and educational services . in your exemple of one submissive wife and eight kids , how long do you think the four potential girls will stay submissive ? also if the liberals outnumber the conservatives four to one , with an average of two kids per liberal , liberal probably wins cultural dominance as their girls are educated ."
9zggsa,"the kurdish people should be given independence . please leave the footnote below the following line , but remember to delete this sentence by replacing it with the body of your post .","for a territory controlled by a government to be effectively independent is basically a matter of being recognized as the legitimate government of that territory by some number of other recognized national governments . usually you need the immediately bordering nations to recognize the borders of the new nation . if a major global power like the us really wants to recognize you , many other nations might go along with it . it 's a complex thing depending on which nations want it and do n't want it , and how strongly they feel about that . i might agree that , in some cosmic justice sense , the kurdish people deserve their own nation , maybe even more than some other nations deserve it . such as , "" the usa should tell the kurds that it is open to recognizing a kurdish nation , subject to the specific borders proposed "" . you can make a case that this would be a positive thing , but i would argue that the history of western powers arbitrarily deciding what should and should not be a nation in the middle east is , uh , troublesome at best . for the us government to openly suggest this , without even a specific set of borders proposed , could cause major tension in diplomatic relationships with iraq , turkey , ( what 's left of ) syria , iran , saudi arabia , etc . whether or not the us would actually do this depends a lot more on what our relationship with these nations is like than what is ( in our opinions ) objectively fair for the kurdish people . for practical purposes , you would do better to have iraq , turkey , and syria suggest this , as these are the countries currently formally responsible for the land that a notional kurdistan might want to control . i 'm not at all an expert in the politics of these countries , but my amateur opinion as to the likelihood of that is , do n't hold your breath . from what i 've heard , given that turkey is actively fighting against any kurdish militias in syria because they are terrified of greater kurdish independence and what its effect would be on kurdish rebel groups in their own territory , it seems like the mere existence of such a nation , without even taking any of their territory , is a total non-starter . not too sure about how iraq , whose territory would presumably become a big chunk of kurdistan , feels , but it 's hard to see them formally giving up territory , even territory they only theoretically control , without some major quid-pro-quo . iran would presumably be an interested party in this as well , and it 's hard to see them being interested in it , given that the proposed nation would likely be a staunch us ally , especially if we 're at the forefront of getting their nation recognized . so , bottom line , in theory i can agree , but i ca n't think of any remotely practical thing to do along those lines that i would want to have anything to do with . more kurds live in turkey and iran than iraq , so iraq may not be the best state to split up . i agree with you in theory but the practical reality of the region is that arabs like having control over other people and even more political instability would ensue with another non-arab country in the region . think of it like this - to this day , israel is still experiencing state sponsored violence from arabs , 70 years after its founding as a jewish state . this little strip of land in the arab world , even with completely legitimate jewish heritage in the region , was so uncompromisingly important that arab leaders have gone to war and sponsored terrorism in israel for 70 years . prior to the modern state of israel , jews and arabs had a relatively peaceful relationship in the middle east , no better or worse than arab-kurdish relations . unless you can argue to me that jews and arabs are more predisposed to hating each other than kurds and arabs , then making arab iraq give up a third of its land for a kurdish state is asking for disaster . its why a country like iraq was formed , which has multiple ethnic groups that dislike each other . granting kurdistan a nation would embolden turkish kurd groups and possibly cause more violence there . it might also cause turkey to invade kurdistan , making the region even more unstable . it seems to be the case that only with lack of power of their adversaries will the kurds gain independence . for example , in iraq after saddam lost power and the arabs went at it , same in syria , it 's only when they lose power do the kurds get it , nobody ever gives it and if they actually did , they 'd have some hold over it . basically turkey and iran will eventually have issues and lose control . losing control means the control goes to the kurds of their own lands . i believe when they gain that control , in whatever context it will grow and eventually all parts of kurdistan will join up , whether these other countries like it or not ."
9zf6wn,"privacy is a fundamental human right and we should stop using the products of corporations that violate it . we should start questioning wether the business models of these huge data-gathering

nobodies , have nothing to hide , are n't doing anything wrong , etc . and they 're wrong because ; & #x200b ; a ) just because you have nothing to hide does n't mean that other people do n't either . b ) having something to hide is n't in accordance with doing something wrong . many people , especially minorities , that live in oppressive countries need to hide their identities from these corporations and subsequently from their government to be able to live . c ) you 're empowering these billion dollar companies to control and manipulate you in any way they like based on their knowledge of you . we know this is the case with personalised search results and feeds as well as insurers overcharging patients based on the data collected by their medical tracking device . d ) such a collection of companies no longer let us participate in democracy but rule over us in a corporatocracy . & #x200b ; as some might consider , opting out of all technology is not a possibility in this day and age . instead , we should start using ethical alternatives to these technologies if we want to live in a fair society . & #x200b ; \ \ firstly let me say that i posted here to actually have my mind changed because i was n't fully convinced about the issue and wanted to hear from what others had to say . secondly , a lot of you raised some good points and flaws with my argument which i appreciate and while i have n't fully given up my opinion , you did reshape my thinking . i guess in the end my argument would be , whether it 's a violation of privacy or not , to stop actually consenting to companies and ultimately governments owning and controlling our data in the first place because of the multiple dangers this brings to our civil liberties , which privacy is an important one of them in my opinion .","i have some assumptions about you based on how you argued your point . i dont like it when people csn google me , but you wont find anything about me , i checked . agree with this but also the guy who said governments need to regulate these companies . i hope you 're talking about companies that steal or hack or otherwise pry into your information without your knowledge and consent , otherwise this makes no sense . you are welcome to stop using companies that do n’t believe in your right to privacy , but it ’s a choice to give up that privacy to enjoy the things that you do . humans fought and died to establish the right to privacy , it did n't fall from the sky . it wo n't be long before we 're communicating directly with thought using technology and at that point in history there will be no such thing as the individual . you 'll have to remember that these companies are only able to provide you free service from advertisers , which require your digital footprint . but there is no way that you can expect them to provide you free service without violating privacy . private information and privacy in general are only seen as important because it 's not universally available and there is value in knowing things about people that they do n't know about you . but furthermore , you are n’t giving up your privacy for free either . it ’s not a one sided deal where the corporation is sucking your life force . if you prefer to keep your privacy , you will also have to give up the myriad of services that the companies provide . if you do n't like the way a company uses your data to profit , you 're more than welcome to start a competitor or leave the service . if you mean violate privacy like the company sold my info without my permission , that 's a bit different . the toa 's should be whittled down substantially to make them understandable to most people . i ’m on mobile so i ca n’t link it and write this comment , but it ’s called “ the year is 2030 and privacy is dead . ” even further , it constantly gives you an influx of information , essentially giving each of us more access to all of the internet and thus more information than ever before . but i know that i would gladly sacrifice my privacy if it made me the smartest man alive through connection to the internet . it 's a free market and no one is forced to use any services that they deem violates their own privacy . do n't you think that everyone should get to decide for themselves if the trade off between convenience these services provides and their own user 's persona data is worth it to themselves ? if you decide that for yourself , you rather have privacy then feel free to not use any of the big tech companies , are suggesting no one should make that decision for themselves ? these multi billion dollar companies are able to provide these services for public use because they can scrape private information for targeted advertising . if you 're not cool with that , that 's a respectable point of view , but your correct version if the world would involve all these services offered up behind paywalls that not all of us can afford , for the personal sense of privacy . if you are cool with that , consider the very real possibility these large corporations act in the behest of state actors , friendly or not , and you can have your information queued up for review , no matter how anonymised it is , it is associated with your ip which is identifying enough , and any government will be able to associate that with your identity and parse together an uncomfortably comprehensive picture of your political beliefs , personality thumbprint , etc . keep in mind there are deep learning scrapers that can and will learn your personality profile and associate all of your accounts together to figure out who you really are down to a full scale sentiment analysis . this will get buried , but as a person working in privacy , it seems like people are n't well educated in where there information will be used and for what purposes . we do have the ability to consent to corporation 's collection and use of our personal information , but i also do n't think the majority of the consent is necessarily informed or meaningful - especially when we do n't have a choice of opting out of giving our info to use a service , and privacy language is buried in a tos and written in legalese . i wonder what will happen when our data will be used to profile us to our detriment , for insurance perhaps , or when the data collection becomes too intrusive . i do n't know if it will ever become very obvious that our data profiles are being used to manipulate us , and thus there will be no outrage . and for services like 23andme , i imagine the companies buying and holding the most genomic data will have some kind of advantage in the future . should we be policing how much of that data stays in our own countries , that is to make sure our people are selling their pii to benefit themselves ? i would even put the right to access to information higher than the right to privacy . secondly , i want to note that vast majority of the uses of user data by the corporations are quite benign . new ai-based approaches to healthcare can make it much cheaper and more reliable , but they heavily rely on using a lot of patients data for learning . so , in my opinion , while the right to privacy should be recognized to some extent , some concessions should be made for the cases where a lot of utility can be gained from using big sets of user data . if i choose to use one that takes my privacy and i do n't care , why does that bother you so much ? privacy is a personal choice , if you wanted to you can get off social media ( like reddit ) and go live in a cabin in the woods you can ! if you choose to use a product that does n't give that kind of privacy , that 's on you not the company . privacy from corporations products is not a human right if you choose to use their products . if you do not like how they use your info you are free to use a different product or not use any product at all . if too many people do n’t like how their info is used by a company , that company will fall . corporatism comes into play when companies lobby to government to hurt their competitors or get handouts from the government , thus hurting consumers by skewing the market to favor certain companies that would have failed in a True free market . as for minorities oppressed in countries , generally this is because of oppressive governments not allowing free speech on social media or by forcing information off of data gathering companies , rather then the corporations ruining people ’s lives with their data . generally , most of this data is used to make their products better for the consumer . you already have a complete right to privacy ... just do n't use their service . what it sounds like you want is to use these companies products and services for free without needing to give them anything . that said , i work in demographic marketing and i can tell you that most databases contain erroneous data which has to be washed before it can be packages and resold . i ca n't tell you how many people have jenny 's phone number : 8 - 6 - 7 - 5 ... 309 . you agree to this "" abuse "" of your privacy when you sign the eula and sign up for their services . like it or not they 're an entrenched service that provides a lot of value to a lot of people , and they 're just one of dozens or hundreds of popular platforms that you 're suggesting we boycott . if you think convincing your friend circle to switch social media platforms is difficult , try pitching a boycott from : gmail , facebook , instagram , snapchat , twitter , amazon , apple osx , and windows 10 all at once . one of the big reasons data mining is legal is n't that these companies take your private information . but the companies you speak of do n't violate it any more than someone who goes through the trash you put on the curb is stealing from you . but the data-gathering corporations are not violating any kind of privacy most of the time because you are voluntarily giving that information and are voluntarily giving them permission to use that information as they see fit ( within some limitations ) via the terms of service . the problem you seem more focused on is how companies use our data . there is no way to move forward with a goal of a more connected world , without giving up some privacy . additionally many options exist to reduce data collection , and tracking . i doubt that having the government make the laws regarding data collection , and use , would be a good thing . most of the people who use technology to the extent that allows companies to do what their doing . trading privacy for private profit is fundamentally wrong and people are n't smart or economically powerful enough collectively to stop it . even though i agree with you about companies and governments spying on us being a bad thing , i think your case could be made stronger if : you decided upon a mechanism of changing the current situation ( consumer choice / legislation ) you better explained why privacy violations are are problem and how our society would benefit from stronger privacy rights ultimately , “ rights ” as we know them can only exist within a power structure that enforces them . if the existing power structure is complicit in violating people ’s privacy , it ’s very difficult to stop that . i do think people need to learn to understand that when you make use of some kind of "" free service "" it does n't mean you 're getting a product for free . i do n't disagree that giving away our privacy to enrich corporations is a horrible idea . either decline the opportunity reap the benefits of social media or make your own network that does n't sell people 's data . right now there is no market incentive to provide social media without being able to make money off the back end from advertisements or data collection . just because you own a certain type of company does n't mean there should be limits on how the company makes money due to the field its in . the concern is not that , but how the data is handled . to your points a ) and b ) i agree we should be aware of and value our privacy . to that point , we should be aware of what privacy we are trading for "" free "" services . personalized search results do n't directly manipulate you any more than advertising in general does . those search results create an information bubble which diminishes the likelihood of finding unwanted results see rise in anti-vax . this personalized search empowers you to manipulate yourself , but once you are aware of how the algorithm functions you can pull yourself out of the information bubble resulting in a normalized search experience . adjusting insurance rates based on usage data is a different thing , it is a directed use of your data , without your knowledge , without a way of altering the decisions being made . looking to the ethical and benefit of these info gathering services , let 's consider a gps , you willingly give your location , speed of travel , departure time , arrival time , destination , and point of origin . now we can ask how to turn a profit for the company . it is certainly ethical for them to sell this information to municipalities for the purpose of roadworks . it is likely ethical to sell this information to advertising companies for prime ad locations , ( road a has 100 travelers daily , road b has 1000 ) . it is likely unethical to change the recommended route to bring travelers near or away from target locations . if it was , we would n't have people who hound celebs like they do . it 's not a violation of my privacy that they know who i am , what i like , and often will start cooking it the moment i walk in the door before i 've even ordered . in the united states , the supreme court defines fundamental rights , based on readings of the constitution , and neither have asserted that privacy is a fundamental right . many people are happy to turn over their privacy instead of their money , and they retain the right to do so . it is illegal to stray from what is written there , yet , there is quite a lot of data they collect . just like you install a lock and curtains in your house , if you want privacy online , you got ta take extra steps . so long as individuals cant avoid violating other people 's privacy , dont expect corporations whos business model is to give you free service in exchange of your data to do so . just like i sell my freedom/time working to get $ , i would sell my privacy to get a functioning app that entertains me . the line should be drawn only when corporations forcibly invade people 's privacy without their consent , like how facebook has ghost profiles for non-users . it is rooted in the idea of having separate living spaces and secure forms of communication , things which simply have n't existed for most of human existence . i used to feel this way and having my privacy invaded has actually made my life easier . it has also been easy to get away from a lot of the invasions of privacy . my husband learned that his phone has been tracking a lot of his data and so he was able to show his doctor how much he walks each day because his phone was tracking it . his phone also tells him the local weather and traffic for his route to work , as well as the news he is probably interested in based on his browsing history . at one point he was getting a lot of porn ads and so we changed his ad suggestions and they disappeared immediately . we always have the option to limit the use of our data and we always have the option of limiting advertising as well . as for companies that misuse the information , limiting their access wo n’t make them behave properly . creating new legislature to inhibit unethical behavior is possible without just saying “ throw all of it in the garbage ! ” basically there is a dude sitting in a room watching screens for cameras all over the city . it is a total invasion of privacy for anyone living in those cities , but the amount of crime it prevents or responds to is astounding . nuclear fission can make bombs or it can produce enough energy to power a massive city . imagine a society without informational asymmetry and no expectation of privacy . you can know , with ease , what your political leaders make , every back room deal they make . it 's not clear to me that a system without privacy does not or can not work . the majority of people are incapable of understanding terms of service agreements , no person living actually has the time to read all of the ones they 're forced to agree to ( literally ) on just the popular platforms . if privacy is a fundamental right , it is not the responsibility of the individual to encyclopediacly know when where how and why their rights are being violated , and by whom , but it should be the action of a regulatory body , staffed with experts in all relevant fields , with the ability to levy meaningful sanctions on violators ( think gdpr but bigger fines ) we should use our collective power to democratically create a new regulatory body that ensures none of these corporations , nor any products , are legally permitted to violate our rights . because it is pretty damn silly to call something a right if massive corporations with as much power as many nation states are allowed to violate those rights without sanction privacy isnt quite the same thing as data protection ( at least in the common law of the uk ) , but just because a right is fundental does n't mean it ca n't be interfered with ( for law enforcement , national security , etc ) . when you boil it down , i think a good , contextual definition of privacy is as follows : ultimately the reason an individual wants privacy is because they fear judgment for what they are , or have done . however , there are practical downsides to completely eliminating privacy , and they are all over the collective consciousness . but while people laud privacy as some sort of solution without downsides , i really do n't see it that way . the underlying problem when a corrupt government is putting the wrong people in jail is n't the fact that people 's anonymity is lost . if you set up a system that relies on moral actions by corporations you are setting up a system that fails because immoral companies will always be more profitable and out-compete moral companies . the place for your rights to be protected , and corporation 's to be restrained in their conduct , is government . we need to demand our lawmakers step in to pass regulation that protects people 's privacy . frankly i think a big function of the cia and fbi should be in creating the basic pieces of the internet so that we have our foundational lego blocks be secure and that way hundreds of millions of people ca n't be hacked because of some ubiquitous software/hardware issue . people who live in hunter gatherer communities have virtually no privacy , so it 's not like it 's something natural . when you quickly accept the 20 page users agreement and privacy policies you are willfully giving that company your information . people who use these goods agree to exchange their private information for the right to use these goods . it blows my mind when people download facebook on their iphone and agree to give facebook access to their camera , microphone , contacts list , photos , and other information and then turn around and say that facebook is spying on them . in just seconds i can contact anyone i choose , get gps guidance to any location in the world that i want , or look up any information i choose to learn . i will allow a company to know my location , what kind of porn i watch , and my shopping patterns in exchange for an infinite well of knowledge . tldr : your privacy is still there , you choose to give it up in exchange for goods . giving up some privacy in exchange for an infinite pool of knowledge is worth it . gathering and selling your data is now worthless , and the companies that made a living by doing so are now obsolete . also , while i agree that privacy is a right , you seem to extend this right to a lot more than i believe is necessary , if you are in a public space , you do n't have the right to have people not look at you , similarly if you are voluntarily using a firms website , you need to do more than cry "" i have the right to privacy "" to argue that that firm should n't be allowed to record what you do in their website . now , this does n't mean i 'm not against laws that protect your privacy on the internet , for example in the cases where people do n't realise that their data is being collected . ps : i really dislike the debate over privacy , because people tend to want a black or white answer , and either claim that companies are selling your data to the devil or that they are harmless little lambs . in fact i many companies respect the gdpr for non-eu customers , but it wouldnt be much to ask that they be required to do so . people can give up privacy or lose privacy and still be within natural boundaries . you have a choice to put your information on many services , so they are respecting your right to privacy . no matter the site , you ’re getting tracked by a third party company . so i do n't think privacy should be a human right at all , especially considering the vast number of situations in which removal of privacy is necessary to help people . if you get big enough to where millions of people are buying your millions of products it 's going to involve some sort of privacy issues . why should n't companies be able to use information you provided , assuming you did not sign anything that said otherwise ? c ) they are ' manipulating you ' but i do n't see how that 's a bad thing . if they make more money by charging some people more they will invest in other areas . also i know that some companies , especially apple , have made a big fuss about privacy lately . but i think that the reason why many companies ( most notable google ) have become so successful is because they use your data to create a better product . you just have to opt out from free services ( like google , gmail , facebook , reddit or any social media platform ) and start paying for those services . we ca n't even stop selling arms to a country that murders people in cold blood and you expect people to not use products based on privacy . not really trying to change your view , but i think privacy is more of a duty than a right for most people . we as a society have to protect anonymity and allow for people to pursue non-threatening flows of information . what i mean by that is that we , as citizens , not only have the right to privacy , but we have a duty to make sure privacy exists so that our institutions may encounter anonymous dissonance , such as journalists criticising government or whatever else big scary power truth is corporations dont care about being moral or ethical , their job is just to keep stakeholders happy and return their investment . there are benefits to corporations having more data about their customers . a company that makes pacemakers can study heart patterns that occur before a heart attack to warn users ahead of time . that also incentivized people to work out , since it will reduce their costs . more insurance data means less uncertainty in pricing customer risk , and less uncertainty means lower prices ."
9ze4o5,"the u.s. prison system is n’t great but it ’s good enough and should n’t be compared to nordic countries . i ’m not talking about the entire justice system and wrongful or unjust sentences . i ’m saying that with the amount of prisoners we have , the prisons do a decent job of providing inmates with food , water , shelter , security , medical care and rehabilitation options . i hear a lot of arguments on how u.s. prisons should be more like norwegian prisons . there ’s a couple of flaws that i see when trying to compare our prisons . the first is the prison population . the second is our criminal culture . to be able to accommodate the amount of us prisoners , the same way as norway does would cost an enormous amount of money that i think few are willing to pay . also , our prisons are filled with gang criminals . many people say that gangs run the prisons . they control the drugs , the weapons , the contraband . they ’re responsible for the politics of the jail . i could be wrong but i do n’t hunk prisons in norway are so heavily structured by gangs . could it be better ? yes absolutely it could . could it be a lot better ? without a doubt it could be . to make our prisons a lot better than they are now , we would have to ask the taxpayers to divulge a lot more money . i am not willing to do that . i think we , as a society in the u.s. should put more resources towards keeping people from committing crimes in the first place and reducing sentences for non-violent crimes . basically , i want you to convince me that we should change our prisons so they mirror nordic ones .","the budget deficit has increased by 17 % in 2018 thanks to tax cuts and increased military spending by the party of supposed fiscal responsibility . why is it that when it comes to services which would actually boost our economy and improve the lives of citizens the cost is always too high but when it comes to military spending we can just print money and forget about it ? you might spend a little more money now to make prisons better , but if that lowers the recidivism rate , you actually end up saving money because fewer people actually return to jail . i think a key thing that is left out of your argument is that almost assuredly , criminal justice reform would go along with prison reform . i find it highly unlikely we would get prison reform without criminal justice reform . what this means is that fewer people overall would be sent to prison because our criminal justice system will have been reformed out of the dark ages . so if you couple the benefits of criminal justice reform with the benefit of lower recidivism , you would likely end up saving money because a ) there are n't as many people draining money by sitting in prison , and b ) more people will be more productive citizens helping their communities . paying a little more to give prisoners better treatment ( and more importantly , hooking them up with opportunities to redeem themselves when they get out ) = long term savings from reduced recidivism . of course prison treatment is only part of the problem - another obstacle is convincing society at large to accept convicted criminals and give them a second chance , but i do n't think it 's impossible to overcome . unfortunately when it comes to taxpayer funded projects , short term gain almost always wins out : ( so others have already described how the nordic model may be better at providing substantive rehabilitation , and thus reducing recidivism , so i wo n't focus as much there . instead , i want to talk specifically about gangs , and about how making prisons less restrictive might actually limit gang control . one of the big problems with many american prisons right now is that the way they 're set up actually helps to feed into the strength of gangs . without frequent opportunities to intermingle aside from during meals or on the yard , inmates are able to self-segregate in a way that promotes the growth of gang culture . this is made all the worse by many prisons forcing inmates to racially classify themselves upon arrival , after which point they either turn a blind eye to , or even sometimes promote , racial segregation within the facility . once inmates are forced into a situation where they feel they need to stick with their "" group "" in order to feel safe , and when they have limited chances to spend time with inmates outside of their group , racial gangs in particular are able to thrive . secondly , when contraband and drugs are a valuable market inside prisons in large part because of how restrictive american prisons are . without good and widely available drug rehabilitation programs , users who come in with substance abuse problems are going to sustain demand for a stream of drugs . additionally , the boredom , limited human interaction , and lack of meaningful activity in most american prisons are all known to be triggers for worsening substance abuse issues . without changing our system to promote treatment and a healthy environment the drug market will remain lucrative , strengthening gang presence in turn . similarly , contraband is valuable in prison in large part because inmates are n't given other means for contact with the outside world and to fill up their time . to try to sum this up , the point i 'm trying to make is that prison gang culture is a symptom of the dysfunction caused by how american prisons currently operate . while they certainly pose a barrier to change , pushing nordic-style reforms would likely undercut the hold gangs currently have on the prison system , ultimately helping to lessen this issue . your reoffending rates are relatively high which makes your prison population bigger and perpetuates the cycle of criminal culture . the high cost of this big prison population means you ca n't afford to change system . but the nordic system is one that reduces reoffending rates and rehabilitates people so they wo n't perpetuate criminal culture . it 's a cycle that you 'll probably have to fork out some money to break eventually . i think a lot of people have different ideas of what the nordic systems look like . from a corrections standpoint , i think the nordic focus on rehabilitation and reconnecting with society is the key factor to be implemented here in the us . that ’s True , black and latino communities sometimes have as high as one out of every three people involved in the justice system at some point in their lives . if kids are growing up in a culture where it ’s expected , on some level , that they will go to jail or prison in their lifetime and that they will often they will be penalized for not actually committing a crime or that their sentence will be much higher than a wealthy person ‘ s , then we start to see what ’s happening in the us . it becomes a cyclical and ever-deepening problem where prisoners are not rehabilitated in jails and prisons . when they get out , they are no longer eligible for many jobs due to prejudice against criminals . often , this means that one of their best options for providing for their family and themselves is to return to crime , forcing them into more situations where they are more likely return to the justice system . from what i ’ve seen in tedtalks and talking to industry experts , the thought leaders in the corrections industry are moving towards more rehabilitation efforts . there will always be a percentage of the convicted population for which penalization is the only option until they decide to change them selves , but for most prisoners , rehabilitating them , giving them new skills around personal discipline and emotional control as well as new job skills drastically reduces recidivism and give them opportunities to change their whole family legacy . i do n’t think anyone is saying that the nordic prison system and jails are perfect , but what people do admire is the fact that their recidivism rate is extremely low and they are able to avoid things like gangs for the most part . there ’s a documentary on youtube called “ red onion state prison , ” i think it ’s by the virginiacorrections channel . in recent years , they ’ve moved to a step-down model where prisoners gain freedoms and opportunities through good behavior and participating in programs like the thinking for a change program created by the national institute of corrections . this is the current trend we ’re seeing across the country , after seeing results like red onion state prison , many facilities or taking similar approaches for their populations , in seeing really good results . i do n't think that anyone would propose to change "" only "" the prisons in the us to the nordic system . most would choose to change the whole justice vision , and prison system to be part of it . but for example , if you legalize drugs , then a huge part of the prisoners would disappear as well as a lot of gangs , as drug being illegal but still having high demand is the main reason of existence of a lot of them . and if you divide by 20 the number of prisoners you got in a few dozen years , then you can provide better prison experience , with higher reinsertion rates . prison rape ( among other forms of violence ) is such a common occurence that it manages to slip casually into jokes all the time . watch any sitcom ever , there is going to be a prison rape joke . let it be noted that against male inmates sexual assault was actually more likely to involve a member of the prison staff , too . it 's obvious , it reduces cost by nether housing them , or allowing them to reintegrate into society . the purpose of prison is punishment , in this option you are providing no skills for the prisoners to improve themselves and find a place in society . this is more expensive with the concept being you are lowering the cost in the long run cause they wo n't reoffend . 2 and 3 exist on a sliding scale , with various prison around the world , spending more time on 2 or 3 depending on what they want to long term . countries with a lot of violence especially around criminal will choose 2 , cause the person is likely to die in or after prison . the usa is interesting because the prison are often privately run , this means that the prison makes money by housing prisoners . this makes option 3 less finically viable for them , as they make less money when people do n't go back to prison and do n't make more money when they do . you can remove the gang presence considerably , if there was a financial incentive to , as well as reducing the amount of drugs in the prison . part of norway 's move to treat people humanly is so that prisoner rat out other prisoner to the authorities making every easier . in an american prison doing that is ineffective cause it wo n't solve the gang problem in prison and will put the criminal in danger . lastly there are many low level prison , in financially wealth areas , that handle white collar crime in the usa , collectively known as club feds . what about the prison in brazil that puts all inmates in a regular prison at first and they are very , very strict . there is none of this behavior we see in american prisons where the guards essentially just let the inmates do whatever they want . these brazilian prisoners are not allowed to speak , must turn their backs when others walk down the halls , are escorted in small groups everywhere , and it 's silent all the time . after a time , they select prisoners and send them to another prison . the inmates self regulate with zero gang violence ( its not permitted as agreed upon by the group ) . they keep their cells clean and use group meetings frequently to work out any issues . they spend their time learning and getting an education , the group has agreed that everyone treats everyone else with respect . their families are allowed to visit every week with no bars or glass between them , conjugal visits are permitted with married couples . they have no gang violence , no escapes , no drugs ( you 're required to withdraw as soon as you arrive and are supported by other prisoners ) . there is very strict discipline and you have to go through a long and tedious class on how to behave before being put in the population - part of that is learning hand signals and japanese . every prisoner is in their own room , but has a comfortable bed , desk/chair , writing utensils and a window to the outside . the jog march everywhere and are silent all day , except for meal time which is 15 minutes each time . they bathe every day and are expected to have good hygiene and their rooms have to be kept in a specific order . they are given useful jobs within the prison and are n't allowed to speak while they work . in fact , the only time they can speak is briefly at meal time ."
9ze3ze,"i do not think incest is inherently wrong i posit that there nothing inherently immoral with incest ( even if one looks past arguments for moral nihilism and just speaks about our subjective morals etc. ) . now , this obviously needs to be further qualified and explained . relations between a parent and child are in most circumstances going to be immoral ( although i have no data to support this – it ’s just my suspicion ) , but not always ; on one side of the extreme you have child grooming which is truly horrific and on the other side you have oedipus – i do not think he nor his mother did anything wrong , even if they had continued their relations after realizing the truth of their consanguinity . the potential issues are even unrelated to whether it concerns adoptive or biological parents . relations between siblings offer fewer potential issues ( siblings of similar ages especially ) , but there are still many reasons , specific to their circumstances , that might make their relations immoral . the point i am making is that it is not incest itself that causes an incestual act to be immoral , although i believe incestual relations are much more likely to be immoral compared to other sexual relations . for example , i believe non-consensual incest is wrong by virtue of being non-consensual , not by being incestuous – incest is not wrong inherently . there is another , perhaps more important aspect that i ’ve so far ignored and that is related to procreation . while i do not have any inherent issues with incest , i do have strong issues with having offspring born of incest . i have antinatalistic sympathies as it stands already and having children with a higher likelihood of disorders as well as supporting inbreeding depression , i see as clearly immoral . today , we live in times where birth control ( and abortion ) can near ensure that no child is born , however , and homosexual relations do not suffer this possibility . so i believe that just like non-consent makes incest wrong , breeding also makes incest wrong , but neither rape nor reproduction is inherent to incest . now , i am solely speaking of ethics – of subjective right and wrong – not what i think should be made into law ( i have little to no interest in law either way ) . there are higher likelihoods of incest being immoral , so would this justify its illegality ? should homosexual incest see more leniency ? i do n’t know , and so i have no opinion on it . in either case , i do not think incest is inherently wrong .","incest is something which betrays the relationship most families have because it places more value on the pleasure the experience gives rather than the fact that they ’re family . it ’s objectifying and alienating from greater society , the majority of which can never be swayed to believe incest is not wrong . sex with your direct relations is taboo in most cultures and i think that ’s because family serves an important purpose in culture and that purpose diminishes when your direct family are viable sexual partners . obviously “ direct relations ” is up for interpretation but everyone has what they ’d consider a family unit wether that includes cousins and grandparents or just your mother . when you argue the case for incest on a personal level , of course it comes down to that couple using protection and figuring out how their relationship works best . i would say that regardless of whether their relationship is one of incest or not , every relationship needs to figure out good boundaries and good relationship management with the wider world . and in the future , at some point , there will most likely be genetic screening options where parents may get the opportunity to genetically choose the traits they want their baby to a have and avoid any genetic defects . there are a number of good posts on reddit from children of incest and they talk about a number of interesting problems . it is a biological hazard on your offspring 's health , and if society started participating in incest , we would have a society prevalent of genetic disease . "" not inherently wrong "" arguments are always tricky , because most people 's positions do n't just look at inherentness . even though it 's perhaps not inherently wrong , would you agree that the general prohibition of incest could still be a good policy ? if society were to broadly allow incest with only some exceptions , this would likely boost its general acceptance within society and thus also increase the prevalence of the kind of incest cases that are wrong . i.e. the effect would be that a removal of the incest taboo would also increase the number of cases that are based on power imbalances and those that can result in birth defects caused by incestuous procreation . so even if it 's not inherently wrong , it 's still better to maintain the general taboo ."
9zd31x,"presidents should n't exist , people should vote for leaders in their given positions , such as who runs the military , economy , environment , etc having a president makes no sense to me . why give one person the power to select who gets to govern in every position of power in society ? who not have the people select who runs the military , economy ( i know i 'm simplifying by not listing the actual titles ) . this would help with having a less ideological government . we could have a leftward economic policy , but a rightward foreign policy at the same time . in the present system , that 's impossible . it 's all or nothing . it also will lead to less fighting . instead of everyone going crazy over choosing one person every four years , we would all talk about who we like for each position , giving us more to agree on , and having less focus on the identity of the candidates . giving one person this much power has always been insane to me , and really most of what they do is defer power to others . it 's crazy that the person making decisions of war , the commander chief , usually has little military experience , or when they make choices on environment , they have little understanding of the environment . why not have different people compete for who gets to run the epa ? it makes no sense to give all this power to one person","without a single leader we 'd lose a sense of direction the president pushes all kinds of major initiatives that just would n't have the same power for radical change if they were pushed for by a cabinet member or congressmen . or president trump 's push for opioid reform or border security . and liberals may not like the tradeoffs being made to achieve that ( such as costs and humanitarian concerns ) , but i think people of every political background can agree that illegal border crossing are bad and getting them down is good . being a liberal myself , i think there should be good options for immigration and asylum and i do n't think building a wall is worthwhile especially when a huge percent of the problem is overstaying visas , but that does n't mean i want illegal immigrants or want people to be able to get past the border without going through security which allows people to carry drugs over the border . the cabinet consists of the vice president , chief of staff , secretary of agriculture , commerce , secretary of defense , education , energy , health , homeland security , housing , transportation , labor , central intelligence , veterans affairs , trade , and i ’m sure i ’m missing some . the president is n’t really an all of nothing position . it ’s not like he just says it and it happens ... he has to pass it through the proper channels in order to make something happen . anything he passes can get a veto when passed through the proper channels and vice versa with congress . the president is necessary to give all the elements of the government a unified direction with regards to policy . imagine if the secretary of defense wanted to have a war , but the other cabinet members did n’t want to put the economy on a wartime footing . the commander of the military could decide that they want to train a large aircraft carrier fleet , but the minister in charge of the economy wo n't give it any funding . now we 're at a deadlock - the commander wo n't use the existing funds for anything other than a carrier fleet , but they 're insufficient to support one . to solve this , someone has to preside over the meeting where these two discuss their concerns and make the final decision , so that the money and personnel are not idling in a deadlock . that president , seeing that they get to make the final decision anyway , might as well directly appoint all of those ministers so that they only discuss things the president has a chance to approve of in the first place . people vote for finance minister who runs on platform of "" no taxes for anyone "" . they also vote for infrastructure minister who runs on platform of "" rebuilding the nation by fixing all the terrible infrastructure "" , and also health minister who runs on platform to increase nurse 's salaries . you need entire cabinet to have any plausible proposal to vote on , since each part of government ca n't stand on its own . by having one head we can avoid a lot of the inconsistency and infighting . imagine if trump won head of the economy and hillary won head of foreign relations . imagine the head of the economy placing sanctions on a nation that according to the head of the military was a crucial ally and the foreign office was in the middle of sensitive negotiations with . a leftward economic policy and a rightward foreign policy can not coexist unless you somehow render economy independent of foreign policy . for example , suppose your people in charge of the environment create plans for expanding investments into renewables . we could just as easily go crazy over the military guy , or the environment guy , or the economic guy . things like the "" decisions of war "" that you refer to are n't unilateral choices made solely by the president . the epa head is n't picked by him either , he is merely nominated and has to be approved by the senate . so , in your de-centralized system , what happens when the environment-head says that the economy-head 's plans should be scrapped because they will hurt the environment ? think of the president as a guiding hand for the country he 'll lead the country to water but we 'll have to drink . the people pick the leaders and well the workings of government is too complicated for anyone to understand so the people basically do have power in government they pick the people , but for cabinet that 's the president 's job and the people can vote on laws and such we have the right amount of power in government . the president was never meant to do all he does today . he is the boss of the executive branch , which is only supposed to enforce laws and policies of the legislature , the house and senate . the president appoints , but the elected representatives of the people have to approve his choice . in general , the people often barely have a clue who they ’re voting for now , and they ’ll rarely know who they ’re voting for with these positions . you really want the person running the military to be the result of a nationwide popularity contest , often chosen by who has the bigger advertising budget and party support ? i mean , there are checks and balances already in place . the president technically does n't get to put whoever he wants into office , especially for important federal positions , he needs congressional approval ( specifically the senate , if i 'm not mistaken ) . you assume that voting for the head of each department would also be less ideologically inclined . there 's nothing different from people who would otherwise have voted all republican or democrat to vote based on policy preferences and ideology , which would likely be more closer to party lines than ever before according to recent studies on political polarization . just curious why you think for certain that this would be the case ( that people would be motivated to vote for an politically even government ) . most of the government branches overlap in terms of interest ( e.g. foreign policy often involves trade , aid and economic components that also would need cooperation with head of the economy ) , so your idea of an ' ideal ' government in practice would actually be more likely to have conflictual interests . you also give too much credit to the heads of each department . there 's a lot of federal bureaucratic pushback to policy ideas that are ' inept ' , as well as state and local-level pushback to policy that they deem inappropriate for the interest of their constituents . and department leaders are also known for butting heads to preserve the interest of their own department ( e.g. funding ) , and you need an arbitrator who would be willing to push forward the interest of the people - that mandate would really only lie with someone who is elected to represent the entire state/government , the president ."
9z9vqs,"if i host a couchsurfing.com guest and they start coming on to me , it is unethical to sleep with them . even in a casual arrangement such as that made through couchsurfing.com , there is a power imbalance . the surfer 's acommodation is dependent on the goodwill of the host . therefore , any actions made by the surfer that might be interpreted as a sexual invitation can not be assumed to come from a position free of duress . it is possible that the surfer might well be making the offer from a completely comfortable position , however the motivation behind the actions of the surfer can not be truly known by the host . therefore the only ethical position is to not engage in sexual activity . to take the scenario to an extremum , if the surfer and the host were to discuss rationally an offer of sex and the surfer was able to persuade the host the the offer was made of their own free will , independent of any economic imballance inherent in the situation , then an arguement could be made that it is ethical to accept an offer of sex . however in reality i 'm referring to the non-explicit ' come on ' , in which there is an informational inequality . i also accept that in reality life is a series of ethical decisions made with incomplete information , often to do with some kind of sexual contract . if one takes the view put forth in the title literally and behave ethically , then sex would be a rare thing ( which would be a tragedy ) .","the chance is simply far more likely that if a surfer makes such a come on out of their own volition that they are interested in sex and by refusing them if you want it too you are basically depriving them of the sex they want in that case . it 's a 99.9 % chance of depriving someone versus a 0.1 % chance that they weirdly believe thy need to make such a come on even if they do n't ; if you live your life by those odds you might as well refuse every sexual come on you 're intrested in ever because something like tht could be at play . your scenario seems based on the idea that the "" surfer "" is such a pathetic person they would be weasled into having sex because they fear they 'd be kicked out . the main problem with that is the vast majority of people are n't that pathetic , so we probably should not be making ethical judgements generalized on the basis of the most pathetic in society . i do n't see anything immoral to accept such an offer , as long as there 's no reason for you to assume that the surfer does n't really want it ( like a "" hey , i lost all my money ... but maybe sex ?! "" ) i assume that the surfer is an adult person and is able to make their own decisions . i agree that it would be strange for a host to initiate such a thing , but so long as they are n't actively trying to leverage their home , it is fairly harmless . if the host feels like their guest is assuming that they wo n't be able to stay if they decline , then you can always follow up by being more direct . when it comes to more intimate relationships , there is n't going to be perfect communication between the two parties , but as long as both sides try to explain where they stand everything ends up mostly fine . the power imbalance you speak of assumes that the couch surfing guest has no money or other viable options for a place to stay , and is entirely reliant on you . i ’d say that it might be unethical to make the first move and pressure someone who ’s staying in your house into sex , but if they ’re taking the initiative and you have n’t grossly misinterpreted their intentions , there ’s no harm in it . if you maintain that there is still an inherent power differential between the two , even when the guest has the option to leave at will , then i ’d ask you to show me any two people that do n’t have a power differential of some kind . if we were to use a moral framework ( e.g. a deontological one ) that only looks at intentions , and ignores the consequences of the specific action , then the host could be considered consistently ethical , as long as they do n't mean any harm . or they could even adhere to a principle like ethical egoism , i.e. the view that actions whose consequences will benefit the doer can be considered ethical . broke people like sex too and maybe a broke person thinks you ’re attractive and wants to have sex . if they appear to be a healthy and mentally stable adult that is not in clear desperation , then stop trying to nanny the world and let such adults make adult choices ( assuming you want to have sex with them ) ."

9z8mqz,"tolerating people ’s beliefs no matter how bad you think they are is the right thing to do . beliefs are a subject not thought about in depth ( by many people ) too often . many people do n’t understand that all beliefs are genuine ; more specifically when the beliefs are in opposition to their own . what i mean by this , is that someone could believe ( as a genuine 100 % fact ) that 1 +1 = 3 , and most people would think this is ludicrous . of course , the majority of us know that 1 +1 = 2 . this is an easy example because there is a fine line , but what happens when we get into a more grey area ? atheists and theists do n’t always know how to treat each other in regards to religion . instead of tolerating each other ’s beliefs ; some of these people will radically impose their belief on the other , while completely disrespecting the counter belief in the process . instead , as humans , we should tolerate the belief by trying to oppose it more respectfully or just leaving it alone . with a more controversial topic : racists beliefs should also be tolerated . if someone believes a certain race is inferior to theirs , we should tolerate this as well . again their belief is genuine and it is n’t something you can change with intolerance . if you disagree with racism , you must try to convince the person of the alternative , not impose yourself onto them by calling them wrong . this is what i mean by tolerating someone ’s beliefs . before anyone jumps to an assumption , i am not saying racism is good , i am saying that people have their own sets of beliefs that can be good or bad and they should be tolerated . now what you do n’t tolerate is this : someone acting on a universally bad belief . using the example above , if a racist try ’s to kill someone based of their skin or ethnicity , it starts to go beyond a belief . at this point there should be no tolerance what ’s so ever . it is one thing to believe something , and another to act on it . there are several racists who are nice even to those who they dislike , and this is because they do n’t let their beliefs get in the way of being a good human . i ’m sure that i did n’t quite convey my point as well as i would have liked , but i am super passionate about this . please give me feed back if there is a better way i could have said something .","but if you are talking about equally respecting all opinions , or then it is exactly this kind of bias for good , is what we are losing . if racists and anti-racists are supposed to respect each other , then you are n't just creating a fair playing field , but expecting society to make an active consensus that a truth , and it 's hateful , oppressive , and intolerant counter-belief are equally valid things to argue in public , while at the same time , chastising anti-racists who are too disrespectful to racists , for breaking your rules of engagement . "" respect for every opinion "" will never be a categorical , universal principle , because some beliefs are explicitly disrespectful of each other . you can protect each of their legal rights to exist , but once you are defending one as needing to be respected , you are really just picking a side , putting yourself against the belief that it needs to be disrespected . the problem is that beliefs are n’t just a thing that exists in a bubble , they ’re the mindset that dictates our actions . take your example of the man who believes black people are inferior and uses this excuse as justification for trying to kill them . the mindset here seems to be “ you should tolerate people ’s bad believes as long as they do n’t act on them ” , but if someone ’s belief is so non-influential in them that it does n’t affect any of their behavior , i ’d argue they do n’t really even believe it in the first place . one thing i would like to bring up is that as soon as a society tolerates certain beliefs , like racism , people will misconsTrue that tolerance as acceptance , which ( i believe ) is not a message society wants to be sending because it moves hate crimes motivated by racism closer to "" tolerated "" area than it would be if racism were 100 % not ok . in contrast , all otherwise benign beliefs such as religion , philosophy , political leaning , etc. should be respected as long as it originates from the same respect which is extended to it . you only describe how we should act , but you never explain why we should tolerate all beliefs . i do n't really see how otherwise it would be possible to impose one 's beliefs on another adult . we do n't extend same consideration to any other viewpoint - if i say earth is supported by five elephants and genuinely believe it , are people entitled to roll their eye and think i 'm an idiot to be ignored , or even say it out loud ? are people entitled to tell their friends that i 'm an idiot who thinks earth is balanced atop five elephants ? 10 years into our close friendship i turn to you and say : and if you have a friend or family that starts to get into a sects , you risk slowly losing them . they may slowly stop all contact with non-member pf the sect , spend all their money in the sect , and get trapped forever , or at least for a good part of their life . if you have a friend that get involved in a sect , you should n't think "" whatever , it 's his belief "" , you should contact an association , and see what if the best way to not lose this person . i 'm not vegan myself , know why i 'm not vegan , and do n't appreciate vegans telling me to stop eating meat . it sounds like you need to be introduced to the paradox of tolerance : any society that is tolerant of intolerance will inevitably be seized by the intolerant ; therefore , we must not tolerate any form of intolerance ( except for this one ) . there are two things not to tolerate in my opinion : if people wo n’t agree you are a person worth of a rational , good faith discussion , it makes no sense to give them the same person . so if my belief is that you should be property i can own , i ’m not treating you like a person . i should n’t have to debate you that burning down my house is wrong . i feel totally justified in straight up calling that belief wrong if you are splashing gasoline on my house . for my part , i prefer to judge ideas on their merits and dangers , rather than assuming a neutral stance towards every idea . it is right to be intolerant of racist views because when those ideas become too powerful , they are used to harm innocents . it is good to be tolerant of religion and atheism to an extent - "" it 's cool that you want to wear an unusual hat for religious reasons "" . this stops when people are in danger - fundamentalist religions and persecution of religious groups ought not to be tolerated . in short - i do n't agree that all ideas are neutral , it is better to extend tolerance based on how much harm an opinion will cause . a person believes that all people less than 5 ' 5 "" tall should be executed immediately ( doing a weird belief in order to avoid thoughts about existing groups as much as possible ) . if they are voicing that opinion , my primary goal is n't to change their mind . my primary goal is to ( a ) make sure that nobody enacts that idea , and ( b ) let people under 5 ' 5 "" know that we absolutely will not stand for people calling for their extermination . in other words , it 's much better to draw a line somewhere , even when the boundaries can be blurry ."
9z72og,"if men have no business telling women how to handle their reproductive health , women have no business telling men how to handle their mental health . over the past couple of years , with a republic president , republic senate , and a ( formerly ) republic house , rhetoric and policy seem to be threatening women ’s right to get an abortion . in the same time period , i ’ve heard many arguments in defense of abortion citing the claim that ( to paraphrase ) “ old white men in washington have no right to dictate what women do with their bodies . ” essentially , one argument seems to be that , if you are not a woman , you are incapable of understanding the hardship of being a woman and by extension of childbirth/abortions , and therefore are incapable of setting policy to regulate it . i do n’t want to get into the legitimacy of that argument , but i want to take that premise as an assumption and extend it to a different issue . — - two weeks ago , a 28-year-old veteran shot and killed 13 individuals , including himself , at a bar in thousand oaks , california . in this coverage by npr , the gunman is described as “ having issues ” , and possibly having shown signs of ptsd . in late october , a 46-year-old hateful anti-semite murdered 11 individuals in a hate crime targeting a pittsburgh synagogue . this last february , a 19-year-old with “ behavioral issues ” murdered 17 of his classmates in the deadliest high school shooting since the columbine shooting in 1999 . america seems to have a clear problem with mass shootings by mentally disturbed men , one that seems to set it apart from the rest of the developed world . but i ’m also not here to debate the severity of america ’s homicide issue or the causes for it . in the wake of wednesday ’s tragedy ( an event that impacted several acquaintances ) , i heard one particular outcry that placed the onus for these tragedies on the mental state of the average american man . specifically , it claimed that men are in crisis and ultimately killing themselves and others because of “ toxic masculinity ” , or the way our society does not permit them to be vulnerable with their emotions . men must always be tough , men must always be the protector , and this constant pressure is driving them crazy . now , i ’m no psychologist . neither do i have a large body of research to back up my opinions . i ca n’t debunk this argument with clinical evidence that there are no ill effects to displaying what some claim to be an inadequate level of emotional vulnerability . i likewise ca n’t provide a representative study that shows “ unemotional ” men are just as happy as “ emotional ” ones . what i can do however , is reference the aforementioned arguments about women ’s right to determine their own reproductive health , and the concept of one gender having no right to dictate policy or to lecture toward issues that exclusively affect the other . in a nutshell : some people claim that men have no right to take part in discussions or policies that impact women ’s reproductive rights , because those issues exclusively apply to women . the mental health issue in america , if there is one , specifically pertaining to the adverse mental health that leads to violence toward oneself and others , seems to be an issue that exclusively or overwhelmingly applies to men . thus , by the same logic as before , women as a whole have no right to dictate the appropriate level of emotional vulnerability that men should show , and have no business decrying a stoic , invulnerable , “ always ready to protect ” man as toxic , unhealthy or unstable . — - tl ; dr there were two claims introduced here : 1 . men have no right to dictate how women deal with their reproductive health 2 . women have no right to dictate how men deal with their mental health ultimately , i guess my real argument here is that one claim can not be valid without the other . i.e. either both claims are valid , or neither is . change my view .","sure mental health has worse outcomes for men most of the time , but women do have mental health issues as well . my objection to the view itself is in the association of issues not relevant to each other - women 's "" reproductive rights "" vs men 's right to mental health autonomy . i think you decided to draw this association after seeing the "" toxic masculinity "" appeal , and are currently trying to expose the hypocrisy in that individual 's view , which may or may not be held by others . that is , this person ( s ) feels as if you can totally have people do violence against a demographic 's autonomy , "" as long as it 's not mine . "" but i think the only way we can guarantee the implication ( of one being valid only if the other is valid ) is by first establishing the absolute claim that one gender has no business having an opinion on any aspect of the other gender 's autonomy . here is a female having business in telling a male how to handle their sexual autonomy , which is unique to the gender . and just the same , we have women mental health experts , and male ob/gyns . i could field an argument for # 1 based on bodily autonomy , yet at the same time field an argument for # 2 based on academically researched and clinically practiced definitions of mental disorders , without becoming a hypocrite . if , in a hypothetical world , all psychologists were female , then that would result in a systematic "" female opinion "" of how men should handle their mental health ( i 'm implying that the gender of a scientist is a non-variable in the efficacy of their work ) . i think it 's generally unfair to identify an issue as strictly male , and exact influence over it , while complaining about the same attitude from men . nobody is trying to prevent men from obtaining mental heath care , as a contrast to women that are being barred from obtaining abortions . women are more likely to act on their violent impulses with children and usually in less direct methods ( instead of beating or shooting kids , they poison them , suffocate them , or harm them in far more subtle ways ) . people have no right to dictate to other people how to deal with their reproductive health . people have no right to dictate to other people how to deal with their mental health . just as men have no right to dictate how women approach their physical reproductive health , women have no right to dictate to men how they approach their physical reproductive health . i suppose the difference is in the fact that men want to restrict women to do something only they can experience . and mental health is n't solemnly for men , or women . there are differences i suppose in the way they manifest , but not as prominent as with women 's reproductive health . and the fact that men limit women 's ability by law , and women do n't limit the men 's ability lawfully . the only way they do now , as to my knowledge , is by a social standard upheld by both women and men . your logic does n't follow because of a simple reason : pregnancy is experienced solely by women . mental health issues are experienced by both men and women . if we use the logic that men should not legislate women 's health issues because they do not know the experience of it , that logic does not hold for mental health . both men and women experience mental health issues and therefor neither would be unqualified to discuss/legislate on mental health issues , per your reasoning . reproductive health / rights and mental health are two very large topics . abortion and mass shootings are two very large topics with a lot of moving parts , too . to me , at least , the logical comparison to make would be between men and women ’s reproductive rights / health - are women trying to dictate men ’s reproductive rights , and , if so , how ? women and men can be violent and it does n’t necessarily stem from mental health issues . plenty of men suffer from mental health , but do n’t cause a mass shooting . i guess the foundation of the comparisons here ( reproductive v mental ) are too far removed for me to see a meaningful intersection on the examples you use to demonstrate your point . but men are n’t the only ones who can cause a mass shooting , nor are they the only ones who suffer from mental health issues . there was another cmv today advocating mandatory counseling for all ( not something needed , imo , but an interesting thought ) . if women were saying all men ( and only men ) should get mandatory mental health treatment , this would be like men saying women ( and only women ) should get mandatory birth control . i do n't see much similarity between the two positions unless you expand it : many women are anti-abortion and anti-birth control , not just men . many men also think some men need mental health ... some women need it too . now we 've gotten rid of the gender issue - we just have : some people want to restrict reproductive health . one is taking away and the other is giving ( forcing is bad , unless we 've got a violent situation ) but providing mental health to all seems fine . just to be clear , if men deal with their mental health issues by killing people ( including women ) , should women have no right to dictate anything on that ? but that women are n’t trying to control how men deal with their mental health , except to try and not die ."
9z5mjb,"making the minimum wage a “ living wage ” is an impractical goal various movements , including the “ fight for 15 ” fast-food workers , have argued for raising the minimum wage . the arguments are usually that minimum wage income ca n’t cover basic living expenses , and that workers deserve a better compensation for their labor , given such high corporate profits . while i think the goal is noble , i ’m not sold on how these movements plan to try and implement a “ living wage . ” - the most obvious question is , “ what counts as a necessary wage ? ” how are we to quantify what amount of money is necessary for a person to live ? people are different with different needs ; a person who only buys organic food or needs medication will argue she has a different “ living wage ” than a person who does n’t . - living expenses vary widely across the country . it would be very difficult to make a comprehensive , federal ruling on what living expenses are , because living expenses are going to be drastically different in cities , towns , and rural areas . once again , how can we set a fair “ living wage ” if such a wage is $ 20/hour in new york but $ 8/hour in oklahoma ? - as with any other government intervention in the market , there ’s always inefficiency created by regulation . artificially setting the minimum wage too high will have negative effects on the economy . what is the metric we can use to determine how low is too low or how high is too high ? i recognize the free market has failures , but i ’m skeptical of the methods we can use to figure out what the minimum wage should be . - a business that makes more profits because productivity goes up at constant costs is not going to willingly distribute those profits out to workers . long term , labor costs will rise due to inflation , but just by nature of the market system , businesses exist to make money . this is just businesses acting in their self-interest , not evil corporations scheming to ruin people ’s lives . once again , government regulations can be dicey here because of unintended consequences ; likely , any sort of regulation on profit sharing could well make a few people better off but make the economy as a whole worse off as businesses change their behavior . until we can address these problems , i do n’t think trying to set the minimum wage at a “ living wage ” level is a great idea , because there is n’t a quantitative measure of living expenses that applies universally across the country . this is kind of a criticism of the concept of minimum wage in general — a good idea , but one that does n’t quite work perfectly . cmv","so we dont know exactly what is necessary , but working 40 hours a week at $ 15 an hour is certainly a "" livable wage for most people "" i would n't really worry about the person buying organic , because the answer is what are they doing now ? other people have mentioned that minimum wage should be tied to area cost of living and i would probably disagree with that . i think it would be a good way to stimulate the economy in some of the lower growth areas of the country to have a set minimum countrywide . it would encourage people to maybe leave the bigger cities where 15 barely gets you by and move ti smaller towns and rural areas where 15 gets you a comfortable life . i forget the exact numbers but if the minimum wage had kept growing with inflation since the 80s it would be around 15 $ now . we 've seen booms and recessions many times since then and i 've never seen anyone try to argue minimum wage is the reason for the downturn . different states have higher minimums now and i do n't know of any correlations between minimum wage and economic growth sure there is - we have cola for federal workers , the irs publishes a per-diem for each location , and davis-bacon already provides minimum wages for each construction job in each state . it is very easy to say a worker in your area needs to make x per week to get by so pay them x/40 per hour . if you work part time you make less , with ot you make more . many states have set a minimum wage that is more than the federal minimum wage , so this may not be needed at a federal level . the hotel workers have been striking in waikiki for a couple months now , and they want to be paid enough so that one income can support a family . i do n't think this is realistic . not that they do n't work hard or do n't deserve it , it 's just that the economy can not support it . having a low min wage in one area ( ok in your example ) and a high min wage in another ( ny in your example ) would stimulate production in low min wage area and sales in the high min wage area - eventually making discrepancies between areas less and less . companies are in business to make profits - that is profit after all labor is paid as a cost of business should go to shareholders . what 's crazy is that shareholders are fine with the executives giving themselves huge bonuses at the cost of profits . unemployment is very low and most companies are offering more than min wage to attract more/better employees . you say , "" a business that makes more profits because productivity goes up at constant costs is not going to willingly distribute those profits out to workers . but as workers skill increases and the productivity and quality goes up , so should their pay ( faster than inflation ) . a company that does not reward their workers for increased production will lose those workers , bring in new , and lose that increased production ( unless the increased production was purely systemic and not due to skill of workers ) . while i am not for the minimum wage in general , we could fairly easily overcome the second of your objections by tying local minimum wage to the local cost of living . it does n't address the other concerns you have , but that particular concern could be fairly easily overcome if the desire were there . the market setting the price for labor is the only rational viewpoint . i have seen proposals that are designed to attach minimum wage to census tracks and bureau of labor statistics median wage . we know , for a fact , that we do n't lose employment to a damaging degree as long as the minimum wage is somewhere between half and two thirds of the median wage . as the median wage shifts upwards and downwards then so too will the minimum wage in an organic manner . this corresponds much more strongly to housing costs and other costs of living as well . as housing prices rise then people with the power to negotiate with their employers for raises will do so , this will shift up the median and thus make the wage somewhat responsive to the real costs that people will face . if something bad happens and companies need to cut costs , then the drop in median wage ( and therefore minimum ) mitigates the need to fire as many employees . but , we wo n't need to create any new sort of backend or gather information that we do n't already , all we have to do is make sure that the changes in wages lag sufficiently so that companies can plan for changes in wages but not so far that people can end up priced out of their homes . so having it lag by about a year should cover that system , that 's the timeframe for existing changes to the minimum wage and should ensure that changes happen fast enough that not everyone 's leases run out before they can show increased income . figure out how much it costs to provide a person with these things in individual areas , and base the minimum wage off that , in those areas . so , just pulling numbers out of my ass , perhaps the minimum wage is $ 20 an hour in new york or san francisco , and $ 7 an hour in some small town , where cost of living is drastically cheaper . as you say , i do n't think we need to set it on a national level , and doing so is probably doing people in large cities a great disservice . for instance , we can declare that a person working a full-time job should be able to pay rent in a reasonably sized home/apartment , pay their utilities ( electricity , water , heating , internet etc. ) , buy food and go on vacation for 1-2 weeks once a year . “ living wage ” means what it takes to be above the poverty line . the current us poverty line for a single household is $ 12000 a year . full time work at minimum wage is about $ 15,000 a year , after taxes it ’s $ 11,000 . but maybe you could afford them when they were born , but you lost your job and blew through all your savings before you got another one , at minimum wage . the reason 38 states have a minimum wage above the federal is because if they did n’t , the essential low wage workers that are the basis of the economy could n’t afford to live there . the dishwashers , the grocery store cashiers , the warehouse workers , the janitors , etc . no one could do those jobs because they would n’t be able to afford to live close enough to them . it ’s worth noting that the 13 states that have the federal minimum wage also have the highest poverty rates and lowest median incomes . federal minimum wage is not for state likes new york or california where the cost of living is significantly higher ( and minimum wage is already higher ) , but for states that do not have their own minimum wages higher than the federal wage , such as pennsylvania or texas . federal minimum wage is not for workers is large metropolitan areas with high cost of living . it is for the bottom wage workers in rural/suburban areas , often with weak state and local governments . i agree we should be cautious when changing the minimum wage , but having a minimum wage that updates yearly based on cpi brings only marginal changes to the minimum wages every year reducing stress on businesses . by ignoring minimum wage , we are only making the problems companies will face when the wage is updated worse , not better . a business acting in self-interest is not mutually exclusive from an evil corporation . many businesses exist and operate solely on the principle of getting someone addicted to something and then exploiting the addiction . this is not virtuous , and we as people need to realize we do n't have to let companies control us , we can fight back in ways that benefit the interests of the people . business and the government in the us do n't have to be opposing forces , in sweden minimum wage is not set by legislators , but by dozens of cooperative agreements between companies and unions/guilds . this allows for minimum wage based on the job duties/type , properly tailored to what people need and what companies can pay . you may have noticed , but i have said nothing about a living wage . this is because a ' living wage ' is not a milestone we are x years from reaching , it is an ideal , like democracy . it should be tied to the cost of living index and adjusted yearly based on that . businesses would rather a 15 $ across the board because inflation will eventually make it meaningless , the minimum wage will become an issue again and they can use it as a negotiating point to gain leverage for other things they want . but if you do n’t increase the minimum wage , people are n’t able to buy goods and services and the economy slows down . politicians are only pushing for a higher minimum wage now because corporations are backing them — they know it ’s necessary , but they do n’t want to raise their own wages if other people do n’t have to as well , because then the competition can undercut them with lower prices . "" living wage "" is just a general argument about the minimum wage being too low for some people to live on . the policy to raise minimum wage does not have to actually account for different situations to make sure every person can live on that wage . increasing the minimum wage any small amount would get more people into the "" living wage "" category , which is the goal of this movement . that 's not to say it ca n't account for some of these things and create a more dynamic federal minimum wage . proper regulations can increase efficiency in the market as a whole over time . yes , setting minimum wage too high would have negative effects . the general concensus is that minimum wage is too low currently ( it has not increased in pace with inflation and the economy as a whole ) . minimum wage exists to protect employees from being underpaid in an environment where they are so desperate for an income that they are willing to accept a lower wage than they deserve just so they can survive . the employer always has an unfair advantage at the negotiating table , because they know the employee needs a job to survive . if it has gotten to the point where someone working full-time on minimum wage can not afford a cheap appartment , food , utilities , transportation , and communication , then minimum wage needs to rise ( or a more effective solution like ubi needs to replace it ) . we can certainly index it to some cost of living calculation for given metro areas , states , etc . i agree that businesses do what they can to minimize costs and increase profits . this can put the goal of the business in contention with the goals of other stakeholders , such as employees or government . they act in their self-interest , which is part of the reason we have a minimum wage in the first place . i do n't think the seniors of walmart want thousands of their employees to live in poverty and qualify for government assistance , but their desire to protect and deliver profits to shareholders results in the situation . yeah , in reading this post it seemed like most of your arguments also applied to minimum wage in general . or , if you support a minimum wage , could you expand on why you support the concept of one but not a "" living wage "" minimum wage ? but more importantly , the phrase "" living wage "" is intended as advertising for the concept of higher minimum wages -- they do n't actually mean that the minimum wage needs to be high enough to live on everywhere ( e.g. manhattan ) . with that in mind , would n't you say that using the phrase "" living wage "" is actually a good way to advertise the concept ? and if so , i think you 'll agree that it actually makes the goal and the concept itself more practical , rather than less . the original minimum wage in america was made with the goal of it being a living wage . you can read fdr ’s own writing stating that when he signed it in . assuming living wage is already calcualted yearly , which is done for social services , etc . right now , in situations where a person earns below the livable wage in most places , they are entitled to support from the government to make up the difference . most of these programs require the person being supported to be looking for or having found a job . without this support , i believe many of these jobs would go unfilled as one could n't survive while working them , and workers would look for somewhere they could actually live on instead of settling with a below livable position . the end result of this is the business refusing to pay out a livable wage results in our government having to effectively subsidize those companies by paying the difference in their pay to a livable wage . i would much rather see the business bear the burden of paying a livable wage to their employees then our tax dollars bearing the burden of making up the difference ."
9z3qjh,"if it comes to climate-induced migration , the nations with the highest emissions have a moral obligation to admit their share of refugees . not doing so would be morally reprehensible . in 2017 the guardian wrote : & #x200b ; > climate change ' will create world 's biggest refugee crisis ' . > > tens of millions of people will be forced from their homes by climate change in the next decade , creating the biggest refugee crisis the world has ever seen , according to a new report . > > “ if europe thinks they have a problem with migration today … wait 20 years , ” said retired us military corps brigadier general stephen cheney . “ see what happens when climate change drives people out of africa – the sahel \ [ sub-saharan area \ ] especially – and we ’re talking now not just one or two million , but 10 or 20 \ [ million \ ] . they are not going to south africa , they are going across the mediterranean . ” & #x200b ; full article : [ -- url -- ) & #x200b ; if global warming reaches the stage where some coastal areas become uninhabitable , or if draughts with an unprecedented intensity plague a country , people will likely flee . the majority of countries affected will be developing countries that have contributed comparatively little to global warming , yet suffer the consequences the worst . usa , europe , china , brazil ( and possibly others ; consider this an incomplete list ) have an obligation to help these people and offer them easy access to their countries , that does n't involve potentially drowing in the mediterranean sea . & #x200b ; complaining about their ( refugees ' ) crime potential , given how their standards of education and social progress are likely "" behind "" ( to use a normative term ) wealthier countires , and using that as a weapon to bar refugees from entering the country would have to be considered agitation . there 's no judge who 'll persecute you for making vast areas uninhabitable in other areas of the world , and few crimes compare to having your turf ripped away from you through no fault of your own , and solely because wealthier societies would n't dial back their harmful conduct . & #x200b ; taking in climate refugees is ( or will be ) humane and moral and if ressources allow for it , a country should take in as many as possible . & #x200b ; & #x200b ; & #x200b ;","it 's not entirely clear which countries are most culpable for climate change . on one hand , it 's tempting to blame the u.s. and europe for profiting from centuries of industrialization and technological advancement . on the other , you could lay blame at the feet of india , china , and the rest of south asia for aggressively consuming fossil fuels to meet global demand for manufactured goods . you could even point a finger at russia , nigeria , and the middle east for providing the crude oil that has laid the foundation for carbon emissions . in reality , the entire global economy is responsible for global warming . perhaps certain parties have enjoyed a disproportionately large profit from the past two centuries of industrialization , but the rising tide has ultimately lifted all ships . an essential quality of national sovereignty is having control over one 's borders , which includes a nation 's right to decide who it will allow to enter or exit . in the specific case of democracies ( which overwhelmingly represent the places to which refugees want to emigrate ) , the only moral mandate to admit a greater number of immigrants comes from the people themselves . this means that the decision to admit or deny ultimately falls to individual voters . even if we assume that countries are indeed burdened with a moral obligation to admit the displaced immigrants , individual voters still have to weigh that obligation to the world against their obligations to their country , community , family , and themselves , and at this level such considerations of criminality and social compatibility are relevant . if i have reason to believe that admitting economic refugees will have a perceptible impact on my country 's safety or moral values , then those considerations may outweigh the moral obligations borne from carbon emissions . nations can not have moral obligations , they are not moral actors . one of the biggest flaws within the fascist states , one that is the root cause of their issues is fascists believe the state is a moral actor . you can argue the people within a state have the moral responsibility to support certain goals , but this is a vastly different starting point than believing it is the state which should have the ability to act out morality . if you have a nation that pollutes more due to geographic/economic/cultural factors , all other things equal , then by moving people into that nation you are increasing pollution more than you would otherwise . if there is already a feedback loop to pollution , then it 's possible that by increasing the share of refugees to the ' worst ' nations you are simply creating more global warming and therefore more refugees . would n't the more rational choice be to limit additional emissions to prevent making the situation worse rather than seeking to ' punish ' high-pollution nations in a way that also screws over the whole planet ? your claim is that "" the majority of countries affected will be developing countries that have contributed comparatively little to global warming , yet suffer the consequences the worst "" in fact , the majority of countries ( areas ) affected will be the over-dense and/or over-populated ones . and global warming has nothing to with making them such . for example , bangladesh has 162 million people jammed into a country the size of illinois ( for reference , illinois has 1/12th the number of residents ) . niger - one of those sub-saharan countries located within the sahel - has a population growth rate 3.5 times higher than the world average , and 19 times higher than the oecd . females have 7.1 children a piece , and the country has grown from 1.7 million in 1960 to 20 million today . if many millions of people come pouring into europe and north america , how many can they take before they ca n't be supported and integrated ? if the worst fears of climate change come to pass , mass migration will drain some nations of people , leaving wastelands , while overwhelming other nations , and spiraling them into civil disorder and violence ( not saying immigrants are violent , just unfed hungry people are ) . that 's over 100,000,000 people who will be displaced from rising sea levels . that is a lot of people , many will lose just about everything if the government does n't step in in some way . these people will be forced into other communities , and will require housing , jobs , public services that wo n't be there . then there will be the migrants from south america , which likely will be another hundred million if not much more . will millions die in the violence ? this is just the us , imagine china and india , hundreds of millions displaced easily . so we need to do all we can now to prevent this from happening , because if we let it get to the point where caravans of millions are pouring into developed nations , we will see violence on a scale never before seen in history . the ethical thing to do at that point would be to take as many as can be supported , and keep the rest out or we may collapse our remaining societies with our good intentions . it 's almost always better to help people where they are , not moving them . and if you move people , you almost always benefit the place they move to more than the place they left . i understand the moral idea that countries who are most responsible for pollution should bear the brunt , but keep in mind that more people in these countries means more consumption of fuel and resources yet again , creating a loop . if western nations take in more people then that will push co2 emissions even higher which makes the problem worse for the 97 % the west ca n't take in ."
9z3ngx,"the usa is screwed as a nation and is not worth liking at all the usa , with its economic and cultural might and superpower status , has traditionally been seen as a nation of immigrants , hope and opportunity around the world . however , that viewpoint has been increasingly challenged , due to the following reasons : the usa has elected donald trump as president , sparking fears that he may destabilize the country due to his harsh anti-immigration stance , lack of political experience , alleged discrimination against minorities and aggressive rhetoric towards allies such as canada and western europe . him and his administration have also been accused of colluding with foreign entities such as russia in influencing the election results . trump has also been accused of nepotism with his family , lied frequently and being slammed for frequently attacking the media outlets for "" fake news "" the american society and way of life is seen as dysfunctional . for instance , lgbt individuals , non christians or even immigrants are still heavily looked down upon , particularly in rural areas or republican dominated states . minority discrimination exists , such as asians being subjected to a "" model minority "" stereotype , increased police brutality against african americans or favouritism for whites during job applications . native americans were killed by early white settlers and till today , still live in poverty . inner city violence is ignored and it is common for racial slurs such as the n word to still be thrown around . meanwhile , the us has been criticized for its extremely high gini coefficient and lack of adequate social safety nets , resulting in large numbers of homeless and extremely poor individuals who struggle to make ends meet . public transport is almost nonexistent except for certain large cities , due to high private vehicle usage . infrastructure such as roads and bridges are considered in extremely poor condition . healthcare , despite its top-notch quality , is seen as an absolute joke due to lack of universal coverage resulting in high prices and poor accessibility , especially for poorer americans . the us is the only developed nation not have universal healthcare coverage . the education system , particularly elementary , middle and high school , has been chided for not teaching kids proper skills to survive in the working world , instead focusing on standardized tests , causing the us to perform poorly in the pisa rankings . it is not common for students in college to accumulate extremely high debt . bearing arms is seen as an important right to many americans , and no gun control has been implemented so far . even when moving overseas , the us still requires citizens to pay taxes , and could become the only country that still does so . american work culture is notorious for individualism , long hours and a "" make-it-or-break-it "" attitude instead of a "" learn from your mistakes "" attitude displayed in other countries like denmark or norway . a growing number of americans have thus started to emigrate to other countries , due to factors such as better work-life balance , higher emphasis on family , actual healthcare and good public transport . the government has been accused of gerrymandering , corruption and not handling the interests of citizens . meanwhile , increased polarity and political divides among americans has resulted in violent protests nationwide , causing widespread damage to property and affecting the regular lives of americans . both the democrats and republicans can not come to a consensus on bills to be passed . the us military has been accused of warmongering and imperialism , particularly in middle eastern conflicts like the iraq war , while agencies like the cia and nsa have been alleged to spy on citizens and engage in historic coups to overthrow world leaders hostile towards the us , such as in south america . there are also accusations of the usa trying to spread influence in the local news and politics of other countries . the usa consequently receives mixed or negative views from other nations . among reputable news sources like the new york times , cnn or washington post , coverage of america has almost been universally negative , focusing on its major problems , while positive coverage is mostly relegated to "" fake news "" outlets such as breitbart , fox news or infowars , with little to no credibility . due to the aforementioned reasons , the usa has traditionally been seen as a failure and laughing stock , despite its major scientific and technological innovations , military might , cultural diversity , and major culture exports . how can this viewpoint be challenged properly ?","also , the us is not the only country to have problems that you 've outlined , so i do n't see why anyone should specifically point to the us as an unlikable state based on those reasons alone . american citizens enjoy more freedoms and inalienable rights than any other country . i read through your post and i am unsure what viewpoint you want to change . all it measures is income inequality for a given population , it 's a terrible metric for measuring the quality of life between different populations . no , private vehicle usage is n't the reason for lack of public transportation . the lack of public transportation is entirely due to lower population density of the us . the us is huge , and we have a fairly large population in absolute terms compared to some smaller countries , but that population is sparsely distributed aside from major cities , where public transportation can and does work . most of the countries you 're thinking of with good public transportation tend to be in the top 50 to top 100 . you would also see a positive correlation in the us if you analyzed population density by region and the access to public transportation . people have cars because if there was a bus service that can offer the type of regular and reliable schedule to people outside of major cities , it would likely cost as much as owning a car to use . the cost of a ride on our hypothetical bus would be closer to that than what you see in a major city . you pay taxes to your host country , and if that amount is less than what you would pay in us taxes , you pay us taxes on the difference . if the amount you pay in taxes is greater in the host country than what your us taxes would be , you do n't have to pay anything . we have to assign quotas to each country to make the process more fair , and the recent migrant trains are just a way to bypass the legal immigration process ( i.e. its unfair to legal immigrants ) . thus , i 'd argue europe has a much harsher immigration stance than the us , and the fact that europeans criticize us for that is laughable . young people in america have a lot of potential when it comes to going to college and then going into a career after that . also the american people tend to be nice , there may be a few rude people here and there , but they should n’t be a huge issue . the cities tend to be good as well , pretty well maintained and kept together , and many good places to go spend time to hang out at . clinton actually got about 3 million more votes than trump in 2016 , but some states carry more weight than others . i recall a lot of americans being ashamed of bush ( i am thinking of w. , though h.w. puking on the japanese pm was a bit cringe-worthy ) but now he seems , in comparison , to have been fairly competent . the us has some problems with discrimination , but i live in a conservative area , and i do n't think it is as bad as you might think , but it is worse than what many people here think . i think you should also add that schools are predominately funded by local property taxes , so schools in poorer areas of the country are often very underfunded . if you look at the population density of the us , public transport is simply not practical in many areas . the levels of corruption at the low levels of bureaucracy are incredibly low . there are 2 kinds of "" aggressive "" rhetoric -- the kind that says "" we want to attack you , "" and the kind that says "" we want to put our own interests first . "" however , there are verifiable cases of left-wing media outlets deliberately and knowingly reporting fake news in attempts to influence the outcome of elections . so calling them "" fake news , "" while it may not apply to every story , certainly applies to at least some . and in other areas , christians and white people are looked down upon . for you to blame the us and donald trump for them is not only historically illiterate , it 's actually objectively False . for instance , even though black males ( who make up 6 % of the us population ) commit over 50 % of all violent crime ( including assault , homicide , and gang-related crimes ) , you are less likely to be shot by the police if you are an unarmed white man than if you are an unarmed black man . black people are not killed at a rate higher than any other racial group in america . furthermore , there is actually a huge amount of discrimination against the asian community from the black community . black students routinely see their college admissions test scores bumped up solely because of their race -- on the mcat in particular , black students who scored lower than asian & white students were accepted at a much higher rate . this is clear racial discrimination , but it 's in favor of black people . you can not argue that the "" white man "" is holding back native americans when the government of a predominantly white country gives them free land and money ."
9z3cs8,"i believe in a greater german state i originally posted this in r/unpopularopinion , but i thought maybe i should put it here too : original text is as follows : despite the fact that i 'm not even german , and the fact that this idea has been discredited due to nazi connotations , i 've been an advocate for the modern annexation of various territories into germany to create one unified greater german state . such territories include : austria liechtenstein german parts and cantons of switzerland german-speaking community of belgium south tyrol the original idea of germany was the unification of all ethnic germans into one state , and i believe that that will only be complete when these states become part of germany .","germany already has open borders with all these countries due to the schengen agreement . so in effect , there already is a greater german state due to complete freedom of movement . i see what you mean but i think if people there actually wanted this it would have happens but i do recognize your original point about how the nazis ruined the whole idea which is True for a lot of things any way so long . threw out all of those the catholic german areas of switzerland and austria did not have the same national sprite to join the new german nation , its also worth mentioning that the confederation of the rhine was forced upon the germans there . austrians and the swiss which are bother ethnicity and german speaking had different government especially in switzerland . a few hundred years ago a month an german state may have been possible but now to much has happened religiously , politically and culturally to separate them . and right now , the overwhelming majority of them do not want to integrate into a greater germany . sputh tyrol for example what about the italians should we have expell them to continue ' the point of the german state ' which then kind of is anto humanitarian essentially creating refugees . these countries all have their own cultures and laws that are distinct from germany 's . the dutch are religiously and historically not aligned with germany , in fact a large part of the dutch identity is that they are n’t german not to mention there language is different although is a dialect of german . and bavaria is very close to austria in a lot of ways but even they are not completely in broad with being part of germany . so i imagine austria would be the same but connie with a history of dominating the rest of germany and would likely be unhappy with becoming a minority . but why ? yes those people speak "" german , "" ( although that 's debatable for the swiss , i 've been speaking german for 8 years and still ca n't understand swiss german ) but why does that mean they should be all in one country ? but , it 's important to note that even as the idea was at its zenith in the 1830 's -1850 's no one really agreed on what "" ethnic germans "" meant . many decided that a good rule of thumb was the old holy roman empire . only , the lands of bohemia were an integral part of holy roman empire up to and including providing an emperor or two when the hapsburgs were off their game . but , here 's the thing , the czech were n't really fans of being recast as "" german "" . they were a thing long before the holy roman empire rolled into town , and they always had more in common with the poles and sorbs than the germans . so , they backed off and just went with "" german speaking people who actually want to be part of germany "" . you know , people having some degree of self-determination and not forcing people ( probably at gunpoint as that tends to be what happens in annexation ) to arbitrarily move from one box to another . if austrians want to unify with germany then they should . if they do n't then forcing them wo n't actually make germany greater , instead it will create internal pressures that can rip it apart , like we saw in the modern era with yugoslavia . but , once the government was incapable of supporting that concept nationalistic and regional pressures ripped them apart completely . the same thing could happen to germany , there 's already a fair bit of tension and cultural disunity between the east and west , exacerbating that by mixing in the swiss and walloons and austrians seems like a very bad idea in the immediate future . frankly speaking , putting all ethnic germans into one state requires moving significant populations in the americas into one geographic location . ultimately , you have to draw arbitrary lines in the sand when it comes to these attempts because there will never be a clearly delineated geographic boundary between ethnic germans and non-germans as long as freedom of movement and inexpensive emigration are things that exist ."
9z31jm,"celebrities/people with no political experience should not be allowed to run for president . first of all let me start this post by clarifying that i am not american , so i would be grateful if you could define any terms in your comment that might be unclear to a non-american . i 've been seeing a lot of comments/posts lately saying that "" xx person should run for president "" and there are tons of celebrities who have already announced their intention to run for the american presidency in 2020 ( like the rock iirc ) . this post was actually prompted by this comment section where someone said "" keanu 2020 "" and someone who pointed out that since he was a celebrity he should n't be running for president got downvoted like crazy . this makes absolutely no sense to me . celebrities running for president only serves to cheapen the presidency and make the entire election seem like a big joke where anyone can become the president of the usa ( which is a huge responsibility that will have lasting repercussions on a global scale ) . a common argument these days is that since donald trump is already the president , then "" anyone else "" would be an upgrade/the presidency is already a joke . i do n't get how this is a valid argument at all . yes , trump 's rise to presidency was unexpected and ridiculous , but rather than using this as an argument to show that anyone can and should be president , should n't the example of trump be used precisely to argue against the idea that anyone can be president ? clearly his lack of political experience is leading him to make all of these inhumane decisions . i do n't see how a celebrity would be any better than trump , even if they 're a "" good person "" . i 'd like to think that i 'm a good person too , but i would be a terrible politician . instead of proposing that anybody with a good character should be president , we should be putting forth good candidates who are already in politics , because they will be more likely to make wise decisions while simultaneously not being racist/sexist/whatever . i expect people might say that all of these comments are just jokes/harmless fun , but i believe that comments like these cheapen the value of the presidency and i fully believe that with how much people are joking about it there will actually be someone who reads all these jokes and thinks "" haha yeah , the presidency is such a joke , i 'll just randomly vote for anyone "" or worse , not vote at all . also , celebrities running for president will inevitably take away votes from legitimate candidates , and with margins running so close these days , this might actually cause a proper candidate to lose . lastly , i have also seen comments that say that "" anyone nice "" can be president because they will be surrounded by sound advisers who they will follow . how are we to know that they will follow these advisers ? why take the chance at letting some random celebrity be president and hope that they will take the right advice instead of actually electing someone with political experience ? also , i 'm sure that a president receives tons of conflicting advice , so how would someone with no political experience know which path is the best path to choose ? there are so many different things that a president needs to weigh than an ordinary citizen/celebrity would never have to think about ( e.g. budget , impact on different groups , international opinion , etc ) that simply saying that "" oh , he 'll have good advisers "" is in no way a good argument .","unless you can argue a successful path to changing the constitution your argument is invalid . that sort of rule would have prohibited nelson mandela from running for office in south africa . if you require political experience , that limits the presidency to people who 've bought into the system . campains and rallies are a natural fit for celebrity candidates . personality , charm and charisma are measures of fitness by many americans as to whether someone is fit for the presidency . it should not be required that the candidate be an ivy league law graduate to be fit as president and this does not always guarantee success on that stage . our problem is n't that our constitution does n't protect us from electing someone with absolutely no public policy experience . our problem is that the american public does n't value public policy experience enough to elect someone else . president macron of france had never held elected office , but had strong relevant experience related to public policy . in 2 years , he will have had 4 years of experience as the chief executive of the united states of america . granted , trump does n't have these characteristics ... but someone can have political experience and also not have those characteristics , too . eisenhower had zero political experience , and by all accounts was a decent president . i think ultimately anyone should be able to run for president that meets the base standard ( age/nationality ) . i 'll admit there is a certain level of scrutiny the public should have with any persons running and i would love to see us have more actual hard interviews and debates to understand how these candidates think . political experience also is n't necessarily a good thing though ."
9yzxa5,"the voting age should be raised to 27 for civilians the human brain becomes fully developed around the age of 26-28 , so i would round this out to 27 . in addition to making sure that developed minds are the ones making the decisions that affect people on a national level , it would also make sure the same decisions are made by people who have real-world experience in the workforce or raising a family . an exception could be made , however , for armed service members , who could vote as soon as they are in the forces ( meaning 18 at earliest ) . it 's laughable to me that anyone believes it should be lowered to 16 , when there is very good reason to instead raise it by nine years to make sure the voter base is more capable and mature overall .","at the same time , they are n't children and can make ( and are expected to make in all other aspects of society ) rational , informed decisions . as for being a constituency , laws regarding college , employment , and the environment , to name a few , impact this group in very different and sometimes more significant ways than they effect others . one could argue they should have a say in the rules society makes that effect them the most . finally , maybe they are n't fully developed but there are plenty of 27 + year olds that do n't use rationality when voting either explain to me why a 22 year old engineer designing bridges , trains , or other technology should n't get to vote when they have more technical expertise than most of congress . explain to me why a 23 year old climate scientist should n't get to vote . explain to me why a 26 year old phd student should n't have the right to vote , or why a 25 year old tradesman ( who , by this point , might have been in the workforce for around 9 years ) should n't get to vote . explain to me why a 27 year old who stopped developing their brain at 26 should have to wait an extra year to vote just because their peers have n't stopped developing . by your argument , we should probably not allow the following people to vote as well : those with mental disorders , those who have lower iq or educational background , and those who are over 45 since the brain starts deteriorating then . so what you ’re saying is that 27 is the age you actually become an adult , since anytime before you are n’t fully developed , and thus a child . laws would have to change so that anyone below 27 would have the same child labor laws as anyone under 18 now . democracy is n't just a means to an end ( selecting a wise and mature leadership ) , but an end in itself . voting rights were never just graciously "" given "" by the authorities , they were demanded and fought for by the people who thought that they deserve equal agency over their livest to everyone else . democratic governments do happen to produce relatively stable systems , but that 's not because the voters are so wise , it 's largely a consequence of these systems being based on a compromise where everyone who would have a motive to overthrow someone else 's rule , shares the power equally , which minimizes oppression and strife . no matter how erudite and competent your remaining class of voters would be , if their rule would be based on the back of a non-voting subjugated class , that would just lead to gross injustice and eventual revolution . because politics is not about making objectively smart choices , it 's about there being conflicting interests , and people naturally trying to influence choices that favor them . even 18 is an arbitrary number , with various ages of consent , 16 to drive , 21 to drink , gamble , or smoke , etc. but we 've been using it for a long time now . we 've extended adolescence into the early-20s ( college for some , military for some , still an odd semi-supported life ) we hear all the time about boys as young as 14 or 15 lying about their age to go fight in wwi or wwii and now we worry that they are too young to play certain video games . we used to have laws that only white , property-owning men could vote , "" making sure that developed minds are the ones making the decisions that affect people on a national level . "" being old enough to vote or be in the military and not being able to drink , gamble , or smoke is ridiculous , but that 's another topic . the average 16 year old who is in the thick of everything is way more politically informed than the average 60 year old looking at the past and newspapers . also , after the age of 27 , people 's minds get worse over time . thirdly , lowering the voting age incentivises political education ( this is why i choose 10 specifically . it guarantees a vote while in education . ) this means people can be taught to not fall for populism or fake news , making more informed children and adults . finally , the age of criminal responsibility ( here in the uk , at least ) is 10 . i like the idea but i believe in the long run it will put people in the military that do n’t want to be there , and lead to a military similar to china . if there is no selection , what kind of cap would you put on the amount of people able to join the military ? it 's not like boot camp makes your brain develop faster , or ensure a well-rounded , developed mind . while it makes for a small voting bloc ( two million people in total , and you have to consider voter turnout usually being around 50 % of the population ) it 's yet another perk of joining the us military , and another reason to sign up that 's unrelated to actually wanting to be a service member . especially given the possibility of a draft , i think 18 year olds have a vested interest in voting on policies that may or may not require them to become drafted in the first place . the majority of jobs in the u.s. armed forces are non-combat positions , many of which are comparable to civilian jobs . explain to me why a musician in the marine corps deserves the vote while a professionally gigging/teaching civilian musician does n't deserve the vote . but how do these duties alone justify being granted a vote when the job itself is fundamentally similar ? ) with no exceptions . this give people real world experience whether it be work , college , military trade school , ect . it ’s just stupid to make someone wait that long when they can have a fully independent political view at age 18"
9yysmj,"the usa is weak let ’s start off by saying this , the strength of a country is not solely or even remotely determined by its standing military power anymore and when push comes to shove , even some bamboo wielding vietcongs or some few taliban insurgents with decades-old-soviet-made-kalashnikovs can push back the well-equipped american army . so put away your macho "" we-got-the-biggest-military "" attitude . now going forward . & #x200b ; yesterday trump openly defied all credible agencies including america ’s own central intelligence agency over the saudi regime state sanctioned murder and continues to make peace with the saudi regime despite knowing of their crimes . he cites that if the saudis were n’t allowed to purchase the weaponries from the us , they would purchase it from the russians and chinese , that this was an easy equation for him . that if the saudis could n’t buy from usa they would from russia and the us ca n’t let that happen . & #x200b ; this tells me a lot of things , it tells me that the usa can not afford to lose more money , that despite having the largest economy in the world and spending trillions of dollars last year in government spending , for some reason a contract deal worth hundreds of millions should affect them this much . & #x200b ; but more importantly , that the usa can not afford to lose another ally . 10-20 years ago , the us had allies everywhere , they had allies where you would never think ! slowly that number has dwindled . even canada , a country that has similar values as its southern neighbor and related key strategic interests , they are n’t afraid of shedding the saudi arabians . they are able to uphold their morals and say no , this is not us , despite having a comparatively weaker economy and much smaller military . they are stronger than the us . & #x200b ; this america first movement to me , is a sign that usa has gotten weak . so weak that it needs , not wants but needs to put its interest first now , no matter the cost . & #x200b ; if the usa was a superhero , growing up i would ’ve said the us was superman ! the most iconic american superhero , a superhero that was so strong that he would put the interests of others first not only because he wanted to but because he physically could as well . usa ca n’t , they can not afford to put the interests of the weak first because they themselves are weak .","your argument about vietnam is kinda wierd ... the rise of guerilla warfare in the 20th century with firearms hurt every nation in wars like that . i think the fact the us did n't drop more bombs or god forbid the big one , is sign of moral strength . while the country has a large number of serious issues , which will need to be addressed in the coming years , it 's also fundamentally extremely strong . although i think non-military forms of power are becoming increasingly important , i do n't think we can fairly downplay just how much sway the american military gives us on the world stage . as it stands currently , we have more than enough military might to take on any other major global power , and that 's without a draft or major changes to the economy . this raw might has helped stabilize geopolitics even after the fall of the soviet union , as every major power knows they ca n't behave too aggressively , or support regimes that behave too aggressively , without the risk of being demolished in combat . now this solution is n't perfect , as smaller and civil wars obviously continue in this system , but it 's managed to maintain relatively widespread peace , avoiding disastrous wars between major powers as was common in the past . the problem in these cases was n't so much that the us was weak , or that the military was incapable of taking on insurgent forces , as much as that the blow-back from scoring a "" victory "" would exceed the gains . however , the massive civilian casualties and human rights violations doing so would require simply outweigh the relatively mild advantages posed by a "" victory "" in either of these conflicts . while armies are some of the only state controlled entities with the legal and logistical ability to establish themselves on foreign territory , they tend to have neither the tools nor the inclination to engage in the complex task of constructing a functional society from the ground up . as a result , when it comes to nation building in these two conflicts , the us has been left in the unenviable position of trying to fold origami with a hammer . however , despite how morally icky it is , the american alliance with the saudis is actually a major source of strength for us . by maintaining a good relationship , we gain access to huge quantities of oil , and have an ally in the region who provides bases needed for the us to potentially project military power . additionally , by supporting saudi arabia as an evenly matched rival against iran , we create dynamic in the middle east where no one country can gain too much power , and where war between nations is disincentivized . now again , this does n't excuse the deplorable actions of the saudi government , and i hope the next american administration does more to keep them in check , but at the same time our efforts in the area are a show of strength , not weakness . while trump was discussing the financial side of the saudi alliance , possibly because he has the political comprehension of a sleep 7 year old , that money is n't the reason we 've stayed in our uncomfortable relationship with the saudis . although we do make money off arms deals to the saudi government , this is a drop in the bucket , and would n't significantly impact the american economy if sales stopped . importantly , while foreign leaders have been talking out against trump 's bizarre lies and provocations ( justifiably so ! ) to the contrary , they 've done their best to deal with the current bizarre american political situation , and seemingly show every inclination to resume more productive cooperation once we have a president who does n't seem intent on causing diplomatic rows at every turn . a weaker or less important nation would not see its allies preserve through this kind of turmoil and dysfunction , but our allies have because they know that the us has the resources to make a positive international relationship beneficial to them . that having been said , i do n't think it 's a sign of weakness . those who subscribe to this policy are n't advocating isolationism because they think the us is on the verge of collapse , but instead because they think that america has the power to go it alone on the global stage . these folks feel that with our military strength , massive economy , and advantageous geographical position we do n't need to diplomatically appease allies , who they see as a drain on american , not a boon . although this is just not well founded on pretty much any level , it 's a political viewpoint based off of america 's massive strengths , not it 's weaknesses . like someone else said , name the allies america has lost , name them . the us may be morally week now but it will likely change then change back for the forceable feature but the us is still by far the most powerful country in earth and is n’t in need of ally ’s as country ’s in the past . i 'm going to disagree here , because our military is a huge part of our power . i ca n't think of a war we lost , and when we invaded we pretty much moved forward at will . using occupations , where we are n't trying to destroy and instead occupy , is n't a good measure of absolute power . the rest of your post makes it sound like you 're talking about morals more than sheer power . canada is very much still a us ally , and benefits massively from their geographic location . though the vietnamese were eventually successful , they won at a terrible cost : around 900,000 combat dead or missing with another 600,000 + injured . most are no fan of trump , but they are n't allied to trump . they may not support some of the military adventurism that the us has engaged in but if the usa was ever attacked you 'd find most of the world in your corner . in regards to the different responses to saudi arabia between the usa and canada . though canada showed the character and conviction to stand up to the saudi 's they do not have the strength to effect significant change . also i would n't describe "" america first "" views as another sign of weakness . at the same time the usa currently donates the most of any country to foreign aid and spends more than the rest of the world combined on its military . i would prefer to "" lose "" a war the way the us does with 0 civilian deaths than to have won a war the way developing countries do . just because there are still insurgents left that we did n't wipe out and it gets labeled as a us lose does n't make them stronger than us . and those wars are fought side-by-side with our allies , so not especially good evidence that the us is weaker than other countries , many of which were "" losing "" those same wars right next to us . that is n't a demonstration that america is weak , just a demonstration that trump is weak . both the taliban and the vc lost every single battle worthy of the name they fought with us forces . that 's like arguing that you 're poor , because even though you can live without it , you did n't light a perfectly good 100 dollar bill on fire . no , they can afford to morally posture because they do n't have to be strong when they 're allied with the us ."
9yygpa,"comfort and security are the greatest threats to comfort and security . the premise of this argument is that the better off a person is , the less comfortable that person will be when facing hardship . the less struggle a person has to go through , the less strength that person will develop . the less danger a person faces , the less equipped they are to face danger . when this becomes expanded to the population level and ingrained into the economy , government , education and general social interaction , society as a whole becomes characterized by weakness . this weakness is noncompetitive and detrimental to individuals . long-term , this presents significant danger not just from international adversaries , but from environmental realities . we live in the safest era in human history , yet focus more on safety than at any point in human history . these focuses seem to be psychological safety ( tolerance , inclusivity , acceptance ) , physical safety ( no weapons , masculine = bad , diplomacy at all costs ) , or financial safety ( ubi , social welfare , redistribution . ) from the psychological safety perspective , this is creating a weak minded society . there is an abundance of techniques being employed to make life “ safer ” and “ more enjoyable ” for the average person . this begins at very early age where children are taught to get an adult to solve all of their problems . children are never allowed to be alone because something bad might happen . this pattern progresses throughout childhood into the beginning stages of adulthood . colleges now have powerful organizations created to protect individuals from all sorts of perceived dangers . these policies do n’t stop there , and continue into the workplace in the form of powerful hr and company policies . people raised in this system are ill-equipped to handle inevitable difficulties in life such as death or illness , and are possibly developing psychological issues at rates greater than any point in history . mental illness in english speaking , western nations is more prevalent than many developing nations including those in asia and africa . rates of suicide are certainly increasing . this appears to negatively correlate with the “ progress ” in society . physical safety is being threatened not necessarily at the national level , but at the international level . china and russia specifically have been involved with the “ acquisition ” of new territory that did not explicitly belong to them . they are using force and power to take what desire , and weakness in opposition will only expedite those endeavors . losing the stomach to fight for what you love or want will cost you those things . financial safety is apparent in the growing desire to redistribute wealth . increased state welfare and ideas such as universal basic income are more commonly advocated . free college education ( arguably social engineering in some disciplines ) non-specific to any trade is being promoted as a right . raising the minimum wage to a level that would improve wealth in the lower classes at the time of implementation , but potentially cost jobs that would make this change effectively counterproductive . to be clear , i am not advocating undue suffering , or necessarily that those currently suffering are n't experiencing too much . however , if in a utopian future where suffering is an anomaly , i would argue that it would not feel like less suffering , but more . in my experience , in a spectrum of comfort , going from pain to comfort is a more powerful experience than going from comfort to pleasure . it is better to bounce back and forth from moderately uncomfortable to moderately pleasurable , than to exist continuously on the pleasurable side of comfortable . cmv : there is an ideal level of struggle and difficulty that is most suitable for human beings happiness , and the prosperity of the societies they make up . the pursuit of utopian levels of psychological , physical and financial comfort/security for all is not a net positive beyond a certain point . promoting “ progress ” to the detriment to power in first-world nations is not exportable .","what do you propose exactly to counter this trend ? this line of thought seems dangerously close to the unabomber manifesto to me . russia likely thought some nato nations or the us was behind the coup . this sort of thing was n't uncommon on either side during the cold war . russia has long felt a need to exert a sphere of influence around it for security . a rational understanding of russia 's interests is far more useful than a narrow view of russia as an exploitative enemy . if one views their enemies as evil personified , one ca n't understand how to deescalate , when gains strategic gains can be made by allowing the enemy to save face . viewing the world in black and white is a visual impairment , not a sign of strength . comfort and security can also give space for growth and develop which then provides more comfort and security . if you look at the nominalized gdp per country , most countries with the highest gdp are ones with high standard level of living and security ."
9yww7k,"the differences in economic outcomes between jewish and puerto rican americans prove immigrant economic success is more dependent on factors other than minority discrimination . this is relevant information for today 's immigration debate . first , these groups have many similarities : 1 . both represent about 2 % of the us population today . 2 . both started immigrate to america in the late 19th century and continued doing so in large numbers during the 20th century . 3 . both faced discrimination in america based on their ethnicity . 4 . both immigrated primarily to the nyc metro area . 5 . both groups had a general foundation in western culture ( as opposed to for example vietnam or somalia ) they have very different economic outcomes : 1 . puerto rican household income is 36,000 . jewish is 150,000 , much higher than the us average . 2 . jewish people have founded several succesful american companies such as google , facebook , oracle , salesforce and essentially founded the media/entertainment industry . puerto ricans have founded far fewer . what does this mean : it means that we can not expect every group of immigrants to eventually contribute the same economically . it means that being an immigrant or a minority is not the driving factor of a groups economic achievement . given that america is becoming more and more a welfare state it means we need be able to predict a peoples likely economic contribution . it is a fair judgement to assume that latin american immigrants will contribute econmically in a way similar to puerto ricans . given the nature of americans debt burden , crumbling infrastructure , underfunded court system , and underpaid teachers , it is important that any group that comes to america be able to contribute econmically at a similar rate or better than the current population .","you name a lot of similarities between jewish and puerto ricans , but miss some key differences . puerto ricans , being americans , tended to come and go between nyc and puerto rico . they kept their language and accent for many generations while many jewish families adopted american dress and english within a generation . the jewish immigrants were often fleeing and in a do-or-die situation . many puerto ricans were more like mexico 's migrant workers , looking for a better job but always able to go back home . many jewish could blend in and "" pass "" as american , in the same way that italian and irish immigrants could . religious discrimination also applied to catholics for a while , so while the jewish were seen as "" other "" the puerto ricans were even more so ( skin color , language , clothing , etc. ) puerto ricans are also a recently established group base in a small location with a long history of colonial rule . i do n't think annual income is a measure of success or overcoming minority discrimination , particularly with such a small population in both groups and some very wealthy individuals that can skew the numbers a lot . jewish people also tend to marry jewish people while puerto ricans are more multi-cultural and may not identify as puerto rican . if you want to "" prove immigrant economic success is more dependent on factors other than minority discrimination "" you might want to compare multiple groups and not just "" model minorities "" and see if you can pinpoint what those factors are . puerto ricans are not immigrants because they 're automatically americans at birth . an immigrant is by definition someone who was n't born holding citizenship in the country they ultimately settle in . another thing to note is that while poor immigrants may end up in low paying jobs , they grit their teeth and fight hard to provide opportunities for their children , which is one of the most noble things one can do . and often , those children end up being much more successful thanks to growing up with an american education . asian americans are a prominent example - many successful asian americans grew up with parents who were laundromat owners , restaurant workers , etc . in that way , the immigrants actually end up with a net positive economic contribution . one huge problem with this comparison is that being jewish does n't have a set definition . for example , there are multiple definitions , and as a result , different population numbers : \ > in 2016 , the american jewish population project at brandeis university estimated the u.s. jewish population at 7.2 million . and dellapergola at the hebrew university of jerusalem estimated the core u.s. jewish population at a lower 5.7 million — but when he included all the other definitions of being jewish his count of american jews reached 12 million . the cost of being jewish was sending your kids , who could be farming , to synagogue to become literate in an almost universally illiterate world . people who did n't want to deal with any of that basically stopped being jewish . for example , there are periods where the jewish population dropped significantly due in part to these pressures and factors . so when you are looking at the jewish population , you are looking at a self-selecting group chosen for traits that allow for greater success today , namely devotion to education , etc . the comparison you 've made is even more skewed based on the fact that most jews resemble the dominant racial group , making overt discrimination less of an issue for many individuals . so in short , your comparison is like asking why puerto ricans are n't as successful as harvard graduates . it 's in large part because judaism is a fuzzy group that largely excludes anyone who does n't fit . jews have been living in america for longer than the 19th century , and in places other than ny area ( old congregations and whatnot if you care ) . what is worth pointing out though , is that a preexisting support structure for many jews was present , which allows for immigrants a starting point from which to grow , something which i do n't know if the immigrating puerto-ricans had or not , not being familiar with that immigration myself . where in the constitution or any document does it say rich people matter more or are you making that claim ? when we talk about jewish immigrants , we 're generally talking about people from europe or israel who had to pass our immigration standards . i think the biggest factor is that puerto ricans are a visually obvious minority group whereas jews are generally white . puerto ricans are victim to the same inequality that many hispanics and latinos of various origins around the us are subject to . you ’re contending that an immigrant becomes a causal individual the moment they become an immigrant , as though they exist in a vacuum . compare economic per capita between puerto rico and general europe and stratify for general puerto rican and jewish european income disparity . many jewish immigrants come from a long line of established european wealth in central/eastern europe ."
9yvrn2,"psychiatric drugs are a danger to society based on the specific evidence and arguments provided by chuck ruby 's white paper , psychiatric drugs and violence , which concludes : "" even though the drugs do not cause violence in all situations and for all people taking them , and the actual risk ratio may be relatively small , the practical meaning of subsequent violent behavior is too serious to ignore and of such a consequential level to question their continued use as the first line of treatment for emotional and behavioral problems . "" tldr : even if the increase of violence attributed to psychiatric drugs is very small ( like 0.1 % of users ) , the fact that so many people are on them ( 20 % of our population , and increasing ) , the consequence is a large number of people who could commit violent acts as a result of the drugs .","so i have a question for you . for those that absolutely require medication to treat their condition such as those with bipolar for instance would n't it be better to risk the low rate of incidence of violence with the medication vs the much higher rate of incidence of violence for unmedicated persons ? psychiatric drugs are n't the danger , giving them too easily is the problem . first , psychiatric drugs are not like based on pseudo-science like homeopathy . and theses drugs are used on people with real pathologies , that ca n't work or be part of the society without medication . i have n't read the article ( sorry for that ) but are n't most of those 20 % of the population taking stuff against depression which i assume is n't involved in the violences caused by i assume stronger medication ? if someone takes the drug and just trips out in their room you should n't care . if someone trips out in their room and claws their face off you should not care . say 0.1 % of users ( 20 % of the population ) increase in violence such that they commit violent acts that they would not have done had they not taken the drugs ( noting that in all likelihood you do n't have a controlled sample - mentally ill people tending to violence will have a higher rate of taking psych drugs than nonviolent mentally sound people ) . if not taking drugs means the other 99.9 % of users are less likely to commit violent acts ( in particular , suicide and self harm ) then the net effect of the drugs is beneficial for society . in essence , to justify ceasing the use of the drugs it is not enough to show that some people get more violent on the drugs - you need to show that the population as a whole is more at risk with people on the drugs than the population is without those people on the drugs . psychiatric drugs are also the reason i 'm not a self-destructive maniac , ruining the life of myself and my family ."
9yvk9k,"bartenders should be able to refuse liqour service to pregnant women . bartenders in canada have the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason , except for protected classes . for absolutely every other instance i believe that pregnant women should be a protected class . where i come into conflict is that i could not in good conscience serve someone a drink if that drink is proven to be likely to cause harm to another . the law even states that i am responsible for patrons who become intoxicated and hurt someone or them selves . i would feel personally responsible if i somehow found out i served a pregnant woman some tequila and her baby was born with birth defects or a miscarriage . an important note is that i do not think it should be illegal to serve them . this would mean that if a pregnant woman wants to get drunk , there are litteraly hundreds of bars and chances are someone does n't care enough to lose out on a few bucks . what wo n't change my view is the whole "" my body my choice "" angle , because you can get a drink without making me responsible . such as lying and saying "" i am not pregnant "" , because i would have plausible deniability . or the idea that this would result in non-pregnant women being refused service , because of the sheer number of bars and the nature of competition .","bartenders can refuse to serve liquor to anyone they feel not deemed fit to drink . but many bartenders would not serve you if you seem too drunk , if you are behaving on a un unproper manner ... the problem with your suggestion is that women have body autonomy , but the thing on your side is that the consumption of substances while being pregnant is one of the most frowned upon things ever . so most of the consumption of this substances by carrying women is done in the dark . but , if that were a law — if bartenders can refuse service due to perceived pregnancy — if a bartender accidentally does serve a pregnant person , said bar ( tender ) would be likely ( more ) legally responsible for consequences that could be claimed due to the bartender ’s lack of “ restraint . ” if the first sentence is True , and i am only a us lawyer , not a canadian lawyer , then you do not want pregnant women to be a protected class . if the first sentence is True , then the law already allows for a bartender to refuse to serve someone they believe to be pregnant . if being pregnant was a protected class , then the bartender could not refuse service to someone solely based on that class . i 'm guessing canada is similar to the us which recognizes protected classes as age , race , gender , and national origin . so a bartender in the us can not refuse service to a black man because he is black because race is a protected class . first off - i agree with you that pregnant women should abstain . though i personally know very health-conscious people who believe the occasional drink is not harmful . i think that we would agree with each other even more if we were to say that pregnant women should not smoke . now if my pregnant wife wants to stop and get a bottle of whiskey for a birthday gift for me ... she would get refused service . there are already posters telling pregnant women not to drink . ca n’t the bartender just say that they felt she was inebriated and her pregnant state contributes to a low tolerance and that ’s why they cut her off ? if so , you definitely ca n't be sure that you , as bartender , that a pregnant woman will be hurting an yet unborn child . and related question , if you are worker at a parking lot should you be able to refuse to give a drunk protected class his/car keys ? i think should be illegal to refuse the service and even more to actively try to prevent the service of hapenning . there 's a major problem with this in that it 's often not crystal-clear who is pregnant and who is not until very late in pregnancy , and at that point a drink is far less likely to affect the fetal brain . what if a woman is refused service because the bartender claims she 's pregnant , but she insists she is n't ? should she have to take a pregnancy test in the bar to prove she is n't pregnant ? this ends up being bartenders being able to discriminate against women , period . and we know from looking at pre-civil rights act stuff in the us that market forces do not make people serve demographics they want to discriminate against ."
9yvetj,the united states would be better off without the senate the united states ’ senate is anti-democratic : it ’s composition does not represent the political views of it ’s constituency - the people of the united states . the way i think of it is that the senate is the most gerrymandered election ever with districts being drawn on state lines to directly benefit small & low population states at the expense of the people ’s actual decisions ! gerrymandering only increases ideological polarization because it makes races non competitive and the senate is no exception . but wait ! this would remove protection for minority groups ! i have a solution : if i were to redo the senate i would make it a country wide multi member district with parties nominate candidates . this would allow for many more viable parties as they would only need a proportion of the populous equal to to the proportion of one representative in the senate . in addition because there would not be one monolithic party coalitions would need to be formed and it would encourage bipartisanship .,"the reason we only have two primary parties ( and 25 + minor ones ) is that we have what is called "" first past the post , winner take all "" voting system . this kind of system will always result in two primary parties , the one in charge and its major challenger . these parties can and do switch positions and the can even die and be replaced ( what happened when the republicans replaced the whigs ) but there will only ever be two at a given time . if you actually want to promote additional parties you need a single transferable vote system where you submit a ranked list of who you would wish to vote for . not having coalitions is the result of the us requiring a majority ( 51 % ) or a super majority ( 66 % ) to make things pass . simply having a plurality is not possible in our system without completely rewriting it and this is True for all levels of government not just the senate . all that your idea would do is strip smaller states of power giving it to the larger states that already have most of the power , strips states of sovereignty and agency , removes internal checks and balances from the legislative branch making it more prone to corruption , and move us farther away from the concept of a federation ( each member unit getting equal representation ) and the form of federal government many still thing is the preferable form and the entire reason there was a compromise that split the congress into two chambers . with that in mind , it 's possible there would be no united states , as far as we know it , if without that compromise . at its founding , the us more resembled a collection of nations rather than a unified country . in fact it was common to refer to the us as "" these united states "" to indicate that the members were plural and distinct . the bicameral legislature exists as a compromise in that case with the senate tending to favor low population states and the house tending to favor high population states . if you 're looking to improve the process , i like your idea , but the boogeyman you might want to target is "" winner take all , first past the post "" voting which always results in two huge political parties running largely unopposed , especially if those same parties are consulted when drawing districts . the design of the senate was to accompany the house , as a check and balance . the house represents what you believe to be more ideal , population based representation , but the senate gives a voice to smaller states , and laws ca n't pass without some oversight from one body or the other . the senate does n't meet the definition of gerrymandering at all , because the system is functioning the same as at inception of this nation . the only potential split was california , which would have resulted in democratic "" gerrymandering "" as the states proposed would result in 3 blue-states , with a high likelihood of a net gain of senators . i think it also might be persuasive as a reminder of what "" state "" means in united states . we were originally set up more like the european union than how we think of states . we do n't colloquially equate a state to a nation , even though that 's the definition of the word , and the intent . states should be able to be radically different in law , within the bounds of the constitution . if we start imposing viewpoints based on population , we start really affecting small states , who have no recourse . the house/senate relationship already considers population and gives a voice to small states in a more harmonious way than if it was all population based . i understand the point you 're trying to make but calling the senate ' gerrymandered ' is disingenuous in my opinion . you also state it makes races non-competitive but there are a number of states whose senators change parties rather frequently . so you think that california , texas and florida should decide all the laws for the entire country regardless of all the other states and the people who live there . you have cities that are very dense and everyone has very similar views . democracy would sound a lot more like tyranny if they ignored the views of the rest of the country for the views of a few cities . let ’s create a scenario which evaluates the usefulness of the senate and non-even distribution of representation in general . now suppose california centers all of its population in major cities , along the coast line in the warmer areas of climate . by vote those 51 % can establish policies which completely ignore anyone on the east coast , anyone with cold climates , anyone who lives in rural areas . but without non-even distribution of representation their needs could be completely ignored . rules could be made which benefit imports to western ports , which require visiting sacramento to receive certain government contracts . "" gerrymandering "" is the practice of redrawing political boundaries to favor a certain party . having a chamber of government that uses state boundaries as its method of representation literally can not possibly be gerrymandering , because there is no way to tell which party that will favor . in order for this claim to be valid , you would have to show that the senate in particular has a history of passing legislation that is biased in favor of small states . actually , the senate is an exception , because the senate literally can not possibly be gerrymandered because its districts can never be redrawn . without the senate , the needs of the ten or so smaller states would n't matter . we already have the house to do that , and we have the senate to balance that out . question : did you form this opinion when the democrats ran the senate , or only now that the republicans run it ? if the senate were to be disbanded , the smaller states would have legitimate grounds for seceding from the union . each state entered the united states with certain guarantees and conditions , one of those being representation in the senate equal to the other states . without that representation there is no moral highground to resist states from leaving the us officially . where the independant or newly banded together states have to close borders , negotiate trade deals , mutual defense treaties , disposition of military bases and other federal holdings within state borders , and a whole host of other issues that i ca n't think of . if you vote for a party , and not a candidate , how do you ensure that the individual person taking office is someone you agree with ? a republican candidate won governor ( by a 4 % margin ) , but a democrat candidate won us senate ( by a 5 % margin ) . that means about 5 % of voters picked a democrat for one thing , and a republican for another thing ... we vote for people ... not parties . when we vote for individuals , we can simply change our vote to the other side for that one particular election , to stop that one person from taking office . but , if we just always vote along party lines , the party decides who is actually sitting in congress , and that opens the door for someone to take office who never would have won an individual election , due to whatever reason . the constituency of the senate is not the people of the united states , but the states themselves . removing the senate disenfranchises idaho , rhode island and other low population states . a hard thing with the united states is that we are a huge country with very distinct cultures and views , and that we try to fit all this under one government . every region has different needs , and every region needs to get the government to work for them . its why a small state like maine gets only 2 votes , while a bigger state like texas get 36 . by having a senate set up like we do , we ensure that the needs of small states dont just get ignored . ive lived in states of a variety of sizes , and i know its not an ideal set up , but its the best we can do while keeping states as being semi-autonomous entities , which is very much an ingrained part of american life . the founders were wary of pure democracy and put many safe-guards in place to make it difficult for people to completely take the government over . the senate 's purpose is to provide representation to the states , not the people . the people 's representation comes in the form of the house , which is one of the reasons why spending bills originate there . by eliminating the senate you would disenfranchise basically everybody that does not live in a state with a major city . the senate is only there because the states haggled for their voting power ; it 's disproportionate representation because of history , not because its composition is goid for governance . the whole point of a senate with each state having equal say is to , "" directly benefit small & low population states at the expense of the people ’s actual decisions ! "" the fact that the senate and house actually get very little done is a sign that they are well-balanced across parties and against each other . i think you are saying we should have one nation-wide election where we vote for candidates nominated by each party . what 's to keep some states from being completely out of the running for years and years ( taxation without representation and all that ) ? it 's purpose is to balance the needs of the majority , the needs of the minority , and the needs of the states . representatives would naturally gravitate to the needs of their own state , which they should since they represent those constituents . since they would have more representatives , this would give them disproportionate power not just in values but in budgeting . dismantling the federal government and allowing the people in each state to live as they like is far preferable to the tyrannical alternative of house-only ."
9yuxf2,"if a person believes healthcare is a right , and should therefore be "" free "" , then they should also believe the government should provide a gun to anyone who wants one i only hear proponents of universal healthcare make the statement that healthcare should be a right , so i assume they make this statement on the premise that healthcare should be "" free "" because it should be a right . so what they believe then , is that the government is obligated to provide people with the ability to practice their rights . as opposed to reality , that the government is only obligated to not interfere with your ability to practice your rights . so if a person believes healthcare should be a right and it should be provided by the government on that basis , they should also believe that anyone should be able to request a gun and get one for "" free "" .","there is no equivalence in reasoning between providing affordable healthcare through consolidation of our healthcare system and giving out guns for free . your argument is invalid , so you view is irrelevant ; therefore , changing it is moot . the government should grant the right for people to help themselves be as best able to get a job as they can . this involves providing/subsidizing education and making sure people are healthy enough to be at work or in school . there is a direct causation between people who experience financially straining medical emergencies and an inability to properly get better , leading to having a hard time working or going to school . guns are not necessities for making money like an education and access to affordable healthcare . the government certainly does not need to provide things that do n't directly affect the average person making money . there are two kinds of rights : positive rights and negative rights . a positive a right is a just claim to something that somebody owes you . a negative rights is a just claim to something that nobody can justly keep from you . when people say that healthcare is a right , they mean it 's a positive right . when people say gun ownership is a right , they mean it 's a negative rights . so there is no inconsistency in believing that healthcare is a right that entails the government provide something to you and saying , at the same time , that gun ownership is a right that does not entail the government provide something to you . i do n't think that people who believe that universal health care should be a right necessarily believe that a gun should be a right . i 'm not sure why believing in health care rights necessarily means believing in gun rights . i 'll grant that some people save their own life or that of others with a gun in self-defense . but there are many more people who own guns as a pastime . for these reasons , i believe that the government should make an effort to provide healthcare , but not free guns for everyone . one can believe everyone deserves access to healthcare without agreeing that it should be provided to everyone by the government . it does not necessarily follow that those who believe healthcare is a right also believe healthcare should be "" free . "" what about in a european country , where guns are limited and the use of one is not a right given to people by their government ? the thing is , if the government gave a gun to everyone who wanted one , and the number of accidents also went up as a result of careless discharges then it the amount every person is taxed would increase in order to cover the increased number of patients being treated . the second amendment , for instance , is specifically about not infringing on the right rather than pro-actively enabling it to be practiced . does it mean something codified into law under the bill of rights , or does it mean something more general , just about what things the government should or should not ensure for citizens ? that the government is only obligated to not stand between you and a right . the second amendment is not a worldwide universal , and a lot of people in the united states disagree with it as it stands and do not believe it should be a right . if some people ca n't afford to pay for it , someone has to pay for it . another way of looking at it is a person could go their whole life without needing/wanting a gun , the same could not be said for healthcare . there are plenty of rights that government is obligated to provide - right to legal representation requires government provide lawyers to people who ca n't afford it in criminal cases , right to education requires government have some mechanism for children to access education . right to a jury trial requires members of public to serve in a jury , right to safe workplace requires employers take active action to create a safe workplace , disabled rights requires employers or people running ' public accommodation ' ( rentals , stores , taxis etc ) take reasonable measures to be compliant with accessibility guidelines . similarly there are rights that do not impose such requirement on government or third parties - right to free speech does not require anyone to take any proactive step for example . question is ' given circumstances of a society , should everyone within it be able to access x , and if so how important is x ' ."
9yu34t,"the most important thing in a society the greater good a society should be based upon the well-being of everyone , and having a higher average level of well-being is more important than having everyone somewhat well-off . yes , this system might screw over some individuals , but overall most people will be much happier . there should be no obligation for a government to make sure every single person gets above a certain point of life if the alternative is giving an overall higher average level of life to ( potentially fewer ) people . even if that means that some people might not get what they would have gotten with certainty in "" the alternative "" , do the benefits of the way this system works not outweigh it 's cons ?","look up studies on how happiness increases relative to salary . basically they are very closely related until you reach a point where all the necessities in life are taken care off and you 're not actively worrying about things like rent or food . if you want the highest average good then you need to set a floor to get everyone above because that 's where the lowest hanging fruit is from a utility standpoint . until you get everyone above that line you are going to see a lower return on energy spent versus good achieved . tl ; dr giving 5 units of good to someones who 's really struggling does a lot more for them then 5 units of good to someone who 's much better off therefore we should definitely be focusing on the worst off if we are trying to achieve the greatest good . so we should be able to kill off anyone who does not meet a minimum living requirement . this would raise the overall well-being of the society because the people at the bottom are not dragging them down anymore . in other words some might argue to double down on welfare and some may argue that welfare causes dependency and can lead to the destruction of a population . and in the worst intentions , the guise of the "" greater good "" can be used to create nightmarish situations where a population basically loses all of its dignity and are sort of beholden to just a few people who are in power and claim to know "" what 's best "" for everyone else . can you give an example of society having to choose between raising the average quality of life , and trying to raise everyone 's quality of life ? i get what you 're saying , but it seems like trying to take care of every single person has the effect of raising the average , so in practical terms you are n't really suggesting anything new here . no matter how much someone says they care about other people , if you boil down all their bullshit , they are ultimately lying ."
9ytybj,"if abortion is legal , then "" unborn victims "" laws should be repealed . the federal government passed the unborn victims of violence act in 2004 . in addition , some 38 states have laws on the books regarding unborn victims . this seems incongruent with abortion being legal . if someone can be charged with murder in the death of an unborn child , it would seem to me that the unborn child is considered a human under that law . if that is True then abortion is essentially murder . to be clear , i am not opposed to abortion in principle , but i find these two sets of law incompatible . also , i do n't think you can liken this to the death penalty . in abortion cases , a single individual makes the ultimate decision to abort an unborn child whereas in death penalty cases there are a unique set of laws and rules that govern charges , trials , and sentencing . unborn children do n't have a chance to appeal their death sentence . to change my view you must provide a reasonable argument why the killing of an unborn child is considered homicide in one instance , but not the other .","this is where the choice argument comes into play with abortion . if the mother chooses to bring that baby to term , then she is choosing for it to become a life . if anyone who is not the mother prevents that from happening , then they are committing a murder . the real reason for seemingly incongruous laws on this subject is that laws are the result of the political process and the political process does not require internal consistency . if a woman chooses to have an abortion , that choice is respected and she is n't charged with a crime . if a woman chooses to carry a child , that choice is respected and a crime against the fetus is criminally punishable as a protection of the would-be mother . for instance , i can say , "" since the unborn victims of violence act punishes individuals for terminating the life of a fetus , abortion should also be illegal and punishable by law . "" the reality is , the unborn victims of violence act is purposely vague in order to protect certain fetuses children but not outlaw abortion . unborn victims are victims of intentional violence on an expecting mother . that law is for cases where the assaulter hurts a pregnant woman causing her to lose her baby or murders a pregnant woman and the fetus also dies . it 's because we find violence against pregnant women to be so particularly heinous that we can charge the perp on more counts . the unborn victims act does n't require that the fetus be considered a life , but rather that in the context of violence it 's advantageous in a justice perspective to consider the fetus alive because of how bad the crime is . on the opposite side , abortion laws do n't necessarily need to consider the fetus not alive , only that it 's still ethical to prioritize the mother 's actual life versus the fetus 's possible life . the unborn victims act is about violence on pregnant women while abortion laws only apply to unwanted or dangerous pregnancies . neither makes any claim that the fetus is alive , rather that pregnant women have extra rights to their body . many times these laws are expected to undermine abortion laws . the aclu talks about this , “ anti-choice organizations have long promoted fetal protection legislation as one prong of their campaign to eliminate the right to choose . passage of fetal protection laws gives anti-choice forces a propaganda coup and a launching pad for arguments to restrict abortion . in a 1984 presidential election debate , ronald reagan cited a california "" feticide "" law as support for regarding abortion as murder , asking , "" is n't it strange that that same woman could have taken the life of her unborn child and it was abortion , not murder , but if somebody else does it , that 's murder ? "" so you ’ve noticed and rightfully pointed out contradiction of these laws but this is by design . abortion gives a woman the right to end her pregnancy . the unborn victims law makes it illegal for anyone else to end that pregnancy without the consent of the pregnant woman . if you take a needle and poke me without my consent , it 's a crime . conratulations — you found an exampe that clearly shows the law is not consistent and the reasoning the lawmaker has behind the law is largely maid-up nonsense . child support is "" for the child "" because a child has a right to two parents ' financial backing but single-parent adoption and sperm banks are legal ? laws are not consistent nor meant to be consistent ; laws are made up ad hoc on emotion and then sold as consistent under the pretence of higher rationality that does n't exist ; that is the lawmaker works ; that is how the courts work ; abortion is hardly special enough to warrant its own cmv . for example a company is a legal person but you will never meet a company . it 's legal to end a legal person ie a company but not legal to kill another kind of person : bc the word "" person "" does n't mean the same in common language and in legal language . the incompatibility you see is just an incompatibily in common language not in legal language . laws are n't meant to enshrine a moral philosophy into society , they exist to define and exact justice and order . in particular : losing a child is a devastating loss to a family that was looking forward to having one , that 's a serious damage against the plaintiff that should be considered in sentencing . furthermore , if laws exist to discourage bad behavior , it makes good sense to protect pregnant women , who are particularly vulnerable , from violence with harsh punishments . regardless of the government 's stance on abortion , pregnant women ( and similarly vulnerable people ) may need and deserve some extra protection under law . you could just as easily frame the argument as "" if unborn victims laws are a thing , then abortion should be repealed . "" you 're right that these laws are somewhat ( but not completely ) incongruous . but they are the outcome of two sides with completely different views reaching a shaky compromise . there are going to battles consistently , but the location of the fight changes . in fact , it 's the ideal outcome in a democracy . each side feels like they have some legal basis that backs up their personal opinion . they can vilify the other side and put their beliefs into non-violent political action instead of resorting to violence . you are not legally required to donate lifesaving blood or organs , even after you die . this means that , legally , your right to bodily autonomy ( you do n't have to donate your body for someone else ) beats everyone else 's right to life . whether or not this idea is moral is a can of worms i do n't want to open ... this means that , in the case of abortion , the pregnant woman 's right to bodily autonomy beats the fetus 's right to life . however , killing the fetus without the mother 's consent is not upholding her bodily autonomy , so the fetus 's right to life is the most powerful legal obligation present , so killing the fetus is illegal . this is logically consistent if you consider bodily autonomy to be more important than saving a life . the national act does n't give full rights , it "" recognizes an embryo or fetus in utero as a legal victim , if they are injured or killed during the commission of any of over 60 listed federal crimes "" so there is some condition under which you think women should have access to abortion . given this , do you want to make it legal to hit pregnant women with a bat and kill the babies ? theoretically , you could make that no crime beyond the assault on the woman . if you still want to make it black and white , do you want to completely ban abortion , or make violence against unborn victims not a crime ? with abortion , the goal is to end the pregnancy , while the death of the child is a secondary consequence . i believe that if there is ever a way to end the pregnancy/remove the fetus without killing it , then we would probably have an obligation to preserve its life with artificial gestation . in other words ; the mother 's right ( her bodily integrity ) is not about killing the fetus , but about ending the unwanted continued use of her body ."
9ytjit,"tax incentives offered to companies are unethical and pit cities against each other . they should be outlawed across the country and businesses should compete based on the free market . we see cities lure businesses away from other cities all the time using tax incentive programs . i understand why cities/states would do this , but in the long run they end up hurting everyone ( except the business ) . if no one gave incentives the businesses would still grow and/or move based on market needs and not external factors like incentives . & #x200b ; no one should give tax incentives and let the market decide where businesses will locate . & #x200b ; what will not change my view is something along the lines of , "" if they did n't move here we would n't get any additional tax revenue . "" that may be so , but tax incentives should not be used as loss-leaders for a community . if no one offered incentives the business would still need to exist and give 100 % of their taxes to the government , thus putting everyone in a better position .","given the difficulty of creating a bright line where the behavior becomes illegal , such a law would create an wide opening for a politicized department of justice to selectively enforce the law against jurisdictions run by the opposing political party . local tax incentives almost always turn out well when the companies involved are sustainable , growing , and planning to establish permanent influence in a city . people make more money , there are people moving into the city , new restaurants/entertainment , etc . all of this inevitably adds long term tax revenue as the companies run out of time to write off local taxes . that 's way different than say , and instance like flint , mi where there was no lowering of local taxes and the car manufacturing business in the us was shrinking . gm simply got up and closed a few plants , leaving flint poor and vulnerable to population loss . this did n't require any other american city luring them , only that the free market suggested that mexican and suburban plants were more profitable . the amount that was offered was crazy and set an unreasonable market standard for businesses of that caliber , essentially making sure that only the biggest cities could attract major companies . your view seems to be that government subsidies offered to companies or businesses for one reason or another interfere with the free market , and are ultimately bad for local markets . i actually completely agree with you that government interference in a marketplace is inherently disruptive , but i disagree with your assertion that tax incentives offered to companies are inherently unethical ; i think there are some cases where they can do some good : in many cases , the government has to offer tax incentives in order to fix their own problems . obviously , old businesses in these previously populated areas are noncompetitive , because nobody 's going to drive 15 minutes across town to get a hamburger when they could pull off right next to the highway . by offering tax incentives to local businesses , it allows an ease of access for local businesses to move across town in order to stay competitive , because otherwise these areas right next to the highway would only be available to large corporations that can afford to pay for the new real estate there out of pocket ( mcdonald 's , bk , etc. ) . in cases like this , tax exemptions for businesses can smooth out the otherwise bumpy transition for local startups in the transference of location . although i concede it is disruptive to the free market , the government already disrupted the free market by building the highway in an undesirable location for local businesses . the blame is n't to be placed on the tax exemptions per se , but the prior government interference in the market that merited it . in situations where the government is righting its own wrongs caused by its excessive subsidization , i think that tax exemptions can be a helpful tool to correct this mismanagement . the practice should be disavowed and disallowed at the state and local level , i agree , but the federal government has proven itself very effective at saving economies in certain areas by essentially dictating and controlling the flow of business for different areas . it would n't be a new practice to make sure people in other areas have work . but to say that not tax incentives for companies is the only way is misguided . norway has gone full speed into renewable energy and electric vehicles to the point that if you walk around oslo , you 'll likely see the most amount of tesla cars you 'll ever see for quite some time . and that 's just tesla - it does n't even count other vehicles . they got to that point by offering people incentives to buy from these companies which is essentially a boon to companies that offered electric cars . what exactly are you considering a tax incentive , does it have to be targeted at a specific business , or industry , or would just generally low taxes count ? if a city receives an income tax so that is a net positive for the city is it still a bad thing . what if a city had no property taxes at all and every company moved there it is not an incentive to move there , but they are not making exceptions for specific companies ? amazon is receiving about $ 1.2 b in tax incentives from ny . if these incentives do not offset all of amazon 's tax liability in perpetuity , how does this hurt ny if the alternative was amazon not coming ? instead , ny gets a major employer , the high-paying jobs amazon brings , the tax revenue from payroll taxes from those jobs , and the eventual future corporate taxes once the tax credits are used/expire . as i demonstrated , these are not inherently putting ny at a disadvantage . the business would probably still exist , this is True , but ny itself would be worse off as amazon would have likely picked a city with baseline regulation/taxes that are more palatable . this argument is predicated on the idea that everyone is better off when the government collects more tax revenue . every city , county , and state has the right to levy taxes . it is not possible to make giving tax incentives illegal without completely removing the ability of these entities collecting their own taxes because all a tax incentive is , is offering to not charge a tax they normally charge . that does n't include any city taxes , or the income taxes that employees will pay . if a minnesota feels that they will make more money off other taxes than they are paying in incentives , should n't they try to keep a company on the mn/sd border in minnesota ? but it wont work in the world we created where politics and bribes go hand in hand . cities already have disparate tax rates , and the market chooses accordingly . you mention that in the long run tax incentives hurt everyone . but offering those tax incentives is the free market at work . in fact it is the most democratic type of free market there is . the people elected the officials who are creating those tax incentives . if we allow for different cities and states ( and nations ! ) to set their own tax rates then it only makes sense that , that , in and of itself will drive businesses to different cities , states and nations based on tax rates ( amongst other reasons ) . tax incentives are only part of the equation and it makes sense that a government that was looking to the best interests of its people to attract businesses to it . how is it not in the best interest for a city to attract a large business to it which will bring more high-skilled workers which will support other businesses in the area ? there are potentially win-win situations for cities and companies that would be eliminated if your view was law . imagine a region like the rust-belt with manufacturing or appalachia with textiles where whole industries have left and created vacuums . salaries provide income that can be used to buy goods and services in the local economy . all of these can also be taxed , thereby helping the local economy . as someone from connecticut , lets look at what happened when governor malloy refused to make a deal on taxes in the state . first general electric left , then alexion , then several other large companies followed . utc , the state 's biggest employer , has threatened to move thousands of jobs to other states like north carolina . over malloy 's term , connecticut became one of the worst performing economies in the us and also had the highest rate of people leaving the state ( only state to do worse after the 2007 recession ) . all because he refused to lower taxes on businesses , which lead to massive job losses . why would a major corporation want to pay higher taxes to be headquartered in a state like connecticut when they could get a tax cut and move to a major city like new york or boston ? like it or not , a lot of smaller states rely on tax cuts in order to draw business to their state . this supplies the region with jobs , which sparks the local economy . for decades connecticut had a very healthy business economy with many major public companies . many have left over the past decade , leading to job loss and people moving out of state . all of this is because of high taxes on businesses . some cities have low employment and having a company build a factory , for example , would greatly benefit the local economy . making that city more attractive to companoes improves the odds that a company will set up shop in that city ."
9ysz3x,"joseph stalin should be reviled at least as much as adolf hitler so i came across a story about a russian city putting up a statue in “ tribute ” to stalin . i ’m an american , but as a person who reads history , i ’m sickened by the idea that stalin deserves a “ tribute . ” in my view , putting up a statue of stalin is no different than putting up a statue of hitler ( an action which would be pretty much universally condemned with outrage ) . there ’s a massive amount of evidence that stalin was , if not worse , at least as much of a totalitarian mass murderer as hitler . stalin : - starved ~ 7 million ukrainians to death with forced collectivization . this is called the holodomor . - enacted a brutal great purge of the communist party and red army , leading to almost 1 million deaths . this led to military disaster in 1941 , resulting in million of soviet deaths . - executed 22,000 polish officers in the katyn forest massacre of 1940 and let the nazis exterminate the poles rather than liberating them in 1944 - sent german pows to gulags and systemically raped and forcefully expelled millions german civilians - deported ethnic groups suspected of “ disloyalty , ” leading to at least 1 million deaths of ethnic minorities - arrested thousands of intellectuals and jews , sending them to labor camps much of this stalin “ accomplished ” before hitler even began the holocaust . the ussr also showed itself to be a brutal , totalitarian state which annexed or attacked its neutral neighbors ( finland , the baltics , romania ) and forced soviet-style communist dictatorships in eastern europe , swapping the nazi tyranny for soviets tyranny . the reason we ignore the soviet ’s behavior is that they ended up being our allies , even though at the time , the world considered the ussr to be a firm friend of the axis . i recognize three factors that might be driving this : 1 . stalin ’s atrocities are not as well-known in the west , partially due to soviet secrecy , partially due to the fact that the ussr flight with the allies in wwii . 2 . stalin killed along lines of “ disloyalty ” ; it was not explicitly a genocide like the holocaust , even though class and ethnic groups were clearly targeted . the killings were also not systematic annihilation like gas chambers — stalin killed in more conventional ways like starvation , forced resettlement , gulags , and outright execution . 3 . stalin did effect massive industrialization and lead the ussr to victory in wwii . True as these things may be , these factors are no excuse for glorifying stalin . any results stalin achieved do n’t justify the ruthlessness and terror he used to accomplish those results . in fact , most of the time , stalin ’s atrocities hindered , rather than helped economic development and wartime effectiveness . the soviets being our allies in the war does n’t change this either — that was an alliance of convenience against the nazis , and even before the war ended , tensions began between the soviet union and the west . ignorance is also no excuse , because information about the purges , labor camps , and forced resettlement is readily available nowadays . as a result , stalin and the ussr in general should really be treated the same as hitler and nazi germany : totalitarian states that murdered millions that are the ultimate expression of ideological evil . it should not be ok to wave the soviet flag , just like it ’s not ok to wave a nazi flag . why this is not the case in the west today is i think a failing of our education or perceptions or both . cmv","all i can say on the subject is that stalin 's motivations were n't based in the same kind of hatred and evil that hitler 's were . i 'll always despise hitler more because of that , but i do n't think you 're wrong to hate stalin more just based on the sheer number of people he killed . adolf hitler was the single worst person in human history . to say that anyone should be as reviled at least as much as him would mean they are equally bad or worse . even one thing that makes them slightly better means that they should n't be equally reviled . you listed several factors that make stalin slightly better than hitler . the simplest one is that stalin conducted an implicit genocide , not an explicit one . as for whether either of them should be praised , it has a lot more do with the eye of the beholder than the individual in question . your political leanings determine whether you think stalin was absolutely horrible or just someone who had the right idea but the wrong execution . adolf hitler was a racist . specifically , he was a racist against most people on earth , so it makes sense that most people on earth would revile him . it makes sense that capitalists would hate him and communists would accept , it not outright praise him . stalin used to be reviled for decades in the us , but now many younger people are in favor of socialism/communism , which means mass opinion of stalin has become more positive . if you saw someone erecting a statue for stalin in the west that would indeed be pretty outrageous for the reasons that you mention . it would be even worse in ukraine , the baltic states and most of east europe . there he is seen as a saviour of the motherland ( at least by some ) . yes , he killed a lot of people , but he was the leader of the country that defeated the nazi germany that had plans to wipe out the entire russia . furthermore , during his time russia became a True world power rivalling the united states . even if we ignore all the holocaust stuff he lead germany to the biggest catastrophe in modern times . show me a case of someone erecting a statue of stalin to glorify him somewhere in the west without getting any outcry . and the western education does little in russia , where putin controls what the people are told and what not . a lot of the time , the soviet flag is used less to represent the soviets , but the represent communism or revolutionary socialism . which was kind of the point , radical left-wingers like communists and revolutionary socialists do n't really buy the idea of countries and nationalism , and preach worldwide unity instead . regardless of whether you like those ideologies or not , they 're not explicitly hateful like fascism and naziism , and the awful things stalin did are not representative of these ideologies . they do n't preach or want the more totalitarian things stalin did , or his antisemitism . additionally , the soviets disowned stalin pretty much immediately after he died , and lenin was n't a huge fan of stalin before stalin came to power . stalin is n't really that representative of the soviets themselves . maybe stalin should n't be as reviled as hitler , as the people you 've given deltas to have pointed out , but he should ( and already is ) remembered as someone with a lot of negatives . but the soviet flag is n't really comparable to the nazi flag . not really , most people in the west agree that stalin was a horrible person . as you note , the big difference is the lack of explicit genocide , attempting to extinguish an entire race of people , which is what elevates hitler above other horrifyingly bad autocrats throughout modern history ( including mao or pol pot ) . while i agree that the ussr was very bad and totalitarian , i think it 's a stretch to say the not-stalin times were as bad as nazi germany . hitler is hated for his beliefs , ultimately , not just his actions . hitler had a way of motivating his followers to achieve extraordinary as well as horrific things ; that power is truly terrifying . stalin and communist russia basically had to imprison the entire population for them to follow orders , and even when they did , russia has basically never been an offensive geopolitical force anyways . i mean , stalin had crazy moments and made bad decisions , but hitler was crazy . i think the main reason he isnt comes down to the ussr being the major american ally in ww2 and the fact the soviet records were opaque and unknowable for so long . for example , we 've only just recently been able to prove the soviets were responsible for the katyn massacre . nazi atrocities have been known and studied ( and "" studyable "" ) for much longer . stalin killed people who opposed or threaten his regime in some way . to avoid being killed by stalin , you had to support him . to avoid being killed by hitler you had to not be a jew ( and support him ) . stalin at least ostensibly , also support a policy of equality . the reason that stalin and mao are less reviled in the west is because the mass deaths they inflicted were mostly isolated to their own countrys ' populations , and because letting your people die of starvation rings more of a banality of evil than it does of an explicit targeted genocide . nazi germany started a global war that resulted in hundreds of millions dying all over the world . more americans , europeans , etc. died fighting nazi germany than stalin 's regime ever killed . we as a society are going to feel more strongly against atrocities that have impacted us directly in some way . the entire world felt the impact of nazi germany 's crimes , where as stalin 's impact was kept mostly within the confines of russia ."
9ysyv9,"if republicans do not support abortion or birth control , then they should be supporting social programs to help families raise children . i know that the topics of abortion and birth control are very sensitive topics for people to discuss ( especially here on this subreddit ) . but the main issue i see with these topics is what should be allowed for women to do if they can not care for a child that may come about from having intercourse with someone . in politics , as the issues have come up , republicans have seemed to come to the conclusion that both birth control and abortion are either immoral or a form of murder ( i 'm stating both because these are the most common arguments i see ) . by themselves , i can understand these arguments , i mean i understand wanting to give babies a chance at life , but they also contradict with the fact that conservatives also generally do not support social welfare programs in general but that opposition also includes not supporting initiatives to help families care for children . there are many different programs different countries have done , such as maternity leave , healthcare reforms centered around birth care , subsidies to assist with childrearing cost , etc. . . these are usually government forms of assistance , but there is also intense opposition to private attempts to help families with these issues ( planned parenthood is the first thing that comes to mind , but there are probably other good examples ) . so tl : dr , what am i saying . i 've noticed that conservatives do not support birth control or abortion , but also refuse to help cover the costs of the children that result from the lack of access to these , even when families can not afford the children they are essentially forced to have . i 'd like to see some justification for this , or just some sort of explanation for why they should keep up this mess of contradictions in us politics .","i have literally never spoken to someone who does not support birth control the issue is that dumb people think they can just pull out then a child has to die because of then while sickening , i think the republicans would rather pay people to get voluntarily sterilized than pay them to raise their kids . while i do n't agree with a viewpoint like that , it is a counter to your argument . they do n't want abortion , they just do n't want poor people having children at all . while i agree with the premise , i disagree with people not trying to understand others views or simply looking at those that think differently under your ideology . they want everyone to have a chance at life under the individuals control . a non profit group on the other hand relies on continued support . a bod can choose a ceo to run the non profit whereas relying on elected officials means the best suited person may not get the job as they also have to be electable . ( not saying all non-profit leaders are better than elected officials but it gets back to the required/volunteered aspect of funding ) . my opinion on this , is that we need to turn the us into a pro adoption ( care for children ) country . i mean currently there are ~ 500,000 children in foster care in the us and only ~ 120,000 children are adopted each year . out of those you have to consider the children who are adopted by a step parent or who are adopted from a different country . in my opinion , correct me if i 'm wrong , that sure some people who get abortions just do n't want a baby , but more so are scared , or worried they wo n't be able to support a baby either . they do n't have a support system of any kind . so , i believe that if we give them that support system , the need to get an abortion will be lowered . i think in this argument everyone gets so caught up in whether or not our country should allow abortions , they do n't bother addressing the reason women get them . imagine if we lived in a country that had good medical care that wo n't leave you in 6,000 + in medical bills just by giving birth and gave every baby born an equal chance at life , and told pregnant women that there 's a support system for them if they decide to keep that baby , while improving our foster care system so if they do n't they have another option besides abortion . as / u/kevinwester pointed out , saving someone 's life does not oblige you to sustain that life going forward . most hardcore pro-lifers believe that having an abortion is the moral equivalent of murdering a full-grown adult . however , someone starving or otherwise struggling due to poverty is not , to them , an extreme situation . it does n't , in their own internal scale , meet the threshold for justifying interfering in someone else 's life ( in this case , that would be taxing someone to provide for charity ) . if you ask your typical pro-life republican christian , your average woman seeking an abortion was someone who was in a normal , non-abusive relationship and is going through a regular pregnancy with no medical complications , and just did n't take enough care to avoid a pregnancy . their answer to "" what if i ca n't afford effective birth control ? "" if we tell someone to do something , we are responsible for helping them do it . to them , that responsibility is negated by the fact that they are acting in the interest of the unborn infant , not the mother that is considering "" murdering "" it . to hardcore pro-life republicans , abortion is an issue primarily of personal responsibility , and they feel that providing for mothers who have children will only encourage women to become even more lax in preventing unwanted pregnancies and create "" more welfare parasites "" and more babies raised by mothers who did not want them . therefore , to them , providing for the mother and the new child is not an option , and nor is abortion because it 's murder . if you hold those values , then , the only reasonable option is abstinence unless and until you can afford and use a sufficiently effective birth control , and being willing to accept responsibility and provide for any accidents that slip through . im probally not gon na change your view , but im a republican and i think abortion is a necisity , if the woman was raped , the mother will die during childbirth , or the child will be living an absolute life of hell ( severe brith defects ) . if you want to have recreational sex with no protection what so ever , you made a mistake and should pay the price . i understand a lot of people have struggles , and if i know someone who wants to keep the child even though the mother could die , she was raped , or the child will go through all hell , then i personally will try to help the best i can . i like when pro life people ’s mistresses have abortions that ’s my favorite if people ca n't afford to raise children , they should n't be having children . no one is saying you are n't allowed to use birth control . they are saying you need to provide your own birth control . you go spend 15 bucks a month on birth control at wal-mart . if you want to have care free sex , that is your right . no , i did n't , so why am i responsible for paying for your child . no one owes you anything just because you were too stupid or lazy to go put on a condom and / or go get the birth control at walmart for 15 bucks . that changed when i saw someone get charged with a double homicide for killing a pregnant woman . i 've never known any republican who does n't support birth control except christian fundamentalists and even then it 's their personal lifestyle choice . thinking the government should n't be able to force religious people to buy birth control for their employees is n't the same as "" not supporting birth control . "" i ca n't change your views when they 're so fundamentally flawed i ca n't even address your question . i dont think poor people should have kids if they cant support them , period . i want to allow a person to live but i do n't want to pay for their life forever . i am conservative and am all for birth control but think abortion is immoral . sex is n't a necessity and birth control is n't exclusively a woman 's responsibility . i also am not in support of social programs that helps pay for peoples mistakes and failures . if you ca n't afford to take care of a child or simply do n't want one then do n't have unprotected sex . stealing money from people to give to other people is not liberty or justice . just do n't point a gun at my head and throw me in jail if i cant afford to or do n't feel like it one week . generally speaking , being politically conservative is n't about specific religious beliefs -- it 's about \ personal responsibility \ . as others have pointed out , conceiving a child is almost always a consequence of entirely consensual , personal decisions . whether or not you 're financially prepared to care for a child is not the taxpayer 's problem . thus , there is no internal logic within the conservative "" philosophy "" that drives a mandate for either government-provided birth control or child support . abortion is another issue entirely , considering that it 's largely a debate about the rights of a developing human being . birth control and social welfare are about resources and responsibility . as such , a conservative 's stance on abortion is not truly relevant to the debate about society 's obligations to the raising of children . furthermore , it 's intellectually dishonest to frame the abortion debate as a matter of the political right attempting to unfairly exert control over a woman 's body . the heart of the disagreement hinges upon whether abortion is murder or not , and the government does indeed have the authority to violate an individual 's personal sovereignty in order to stop a murder . my point is this : while you may justifiably believe that conservatives should be willing to contribute more resources to the end of stabilizing society with birth control and social welfare , they are not betraying their own beliefs by deciding to not support such measures . safety nets cost money , and it is perfectly reasonable for someone to decide that they do n't want to pay more their own money to fund them -- even if they would make the country a better place overall . you assume that anti-abortion crowd care about life while what they really care about is punishing the mother whom they consider to be a sinner for having sex for fun . proof of them not caring about life lies in their support for all wars . almost no republicans think birth control is immoral or should be outlawed . republicans are for limited government , meaning they do n't support any social programs ( in theory , i know some of them do ) . it is not the government 's responsibility to take care of you or provide for your children . i wo n't argue about abortion because that would be a long argument and you likely wo n't change your mind . there is a very slim window during a month that a woman can become pregnant and even if you plan it exactly right , you still stand a chance that you wo n’t get pregnant . i support people being responsible and me not having to pay for their proclivities . if someone wants to use birth control fine , they should pay for it and not depend on tax dollars or companies to include it on a plan . i think tax dollars should go toward families who need help raising children . every conservative i know , myself included , support the ability of a person to purchase and use birth control . religious fundamentalists oppose birth control because they believe that sex is supposed to strengthen the marriage and produce children . that is why they are also opposed to non-procreative sex acts and premarital sex . not all republicans are religious fundamentalists , and very few are so extreme they oppose the use of condoms even in the confines of a marriage . as for abortion , the reason republicans oppose it is simple : an abortion is the termination of the life of a human child . a human child must be eliminated - in some cases what we both would agree is killing a baby - in order for an abortion to be completed . conservatives do n't support social welfare programs for two reasons . it is your responsibility to feed and clothe yourself and make sure your children are cared for . by logical extension it is also wrong to force someone to pay money towards a social program . the point you 're missing , though , is that the opposition to pp is due to the fact they perform abortions . they are , in fact , the nation 's number one single provider of abortions . if they did not perform abortions then there would not be opposition to them by any but the most fringe groups . they were also partly subsidized by the government , which goes back to my earlier point about taking money from others . i do not oppose pp being able to privately perform abortions . you have the option of birth control , adoption , abstinence , parenthood or abortion . because the republican position is that aborting a baby is not a choice you are making solely for yourself ; it 's also an act of murder . it would be the equivalent of saying that a person should have a right to murder their spouse to end an unwanted marriage and because you the right to do what you want with your life . the republican position is that you do not have a right to murder your spouse . if you do not want to carry a child to term then use protection or abstain from sex . a key point some people forget when making this argument is that republicans are n’t against supporting social programs , they just do n’t believe that they should be funded by taxes . the idea being in theory that these government programs can be wasteful and ineffective ( can be True depending on what you are talking about ) and they could be funded voluntarily by the community ( plenty of food pantries get supported by local communities and businesses ) i think very few republicans think that birth control itself is a bad thing . again a nonprofit could work to provide bc to improvished communities ( pretty sure organizations like this exist ) without the government having to do it . the logical conclusion of the republican agenda is that only rich people are allowed to have sex , there should be an income requirement to have a libido . you have to understand that most republicans are against abortion not because they want to deny rights to women . therefore , abortion is murder . they 're not saying you must protect children in every way ( including government programs ) . how about we just let people do what they want with their bodies and we also stop supporting anyone . i do n't want a major part of my income going towards people who ca n't figure out life on their own or compete in the most opportunity filled nation on the planet . i 've lived in in two red states and i 've never met someone who 's against birth control lol the argument on the pro-life side is basically you keep the child and if you really have no means to care for it or do n't want it , put it up for adoption . social programs according to the right are considered an enabler , if someone gets government money without having to work , and they get even more for having kids , wheres the incentive to work ? the way alot of replublicans see it is it 's not there fault someone wo n't keep there legs shut it 's easy to not have a kid do n't have sex if they do and a baby ends up coming that 's there own fault no one held a gun to there head and yelled creampie it 's a personal responsibility matter if ur going to have sex u should n't be aloud to say pay for me or i 'll kill it just wait to have sex if u ca n't handle supporting them a male should have one option on this topic : if you care so much , watch where you plant your seed firstly , the great majority of conservatives have no problem with birth control . i have no problem with abortion , but you are responsible for your own actions . i understand that the resulting child had no say in this , and that 's why i 'm personally not opposed to safety nets ( nor are most conservatives , btw ) . i just want them managed better and with strict requirements on how they 're utilized . with those in mind , hopefully you can see that the idea here is not punishment or something . this goes counter to their economic policy . now , they do have some social programs , traditionally religious in nature , but the fact that they oppose planned parenthood is n't evidence of hypocrisy , since pp does support abortion . but getting back to the economic part , mere opposition to something does not mean that someone logically must fund an alternative to it . most republicans are of the mindset that social programs destroyed the family to begin with . their argument is that once you provided welfare to families , they were no longer reliant on a father figure , or bread winner in the household , so the family unit deteriorated . the mothers are incentivized to have more children and receive more benefits , the father is no longer required for the family to survive . this , they claim , has lead to a lack of male authority figures in the household , and thus a larger proliferation of gangs and crime due to youths trying to fill that gap . anytime the government subsidizes anything , it encourages the behavior and produces more of it . i 'm not going to debate right now on where that line is ... that would get a little off topic . but i 'm using this to point out that pro-lifers are n't against abortion because they want to interfere . try to understand that perspective ... abortion is murder ... then you will see there is no contradiction . and just because i am against government run social welfare programs , does not mean i want children to starve . but i do n't believe it is the government 's job to raise a child . and if the parents are truly unable to support a child , then we have charity , churches , and family . but it 's not my fault you or your girlfriend got pregnant , so i should not be forced to help pay for that child . nor should the government force me to pay ... if i see that you need help raising that child , then i might give freely to help you . but today the government actually rewards people for irresponsible behavior , by giving them free money to raise as many children as they can have . however , you seem to be generalizing the majority of republicans with the minority of die hard catholics who feel that contraceptives are a sin . when talking to others ( mostly republicans , some democrats ) , we all can agree that there are at least four choices besides abortion , being contraception , abstinence , motherhood , and adoption . if the to-be mother , is unfit for childbirth such as the child being born is deadly to her and abortion is necessary to save her life the go ahead , life > potential life . now , if she knew that she was unfit for childbirth in the way of not being able to care for the child they have the option of adoption , and should have considered more types of contraceptives or abstinence . tl ; dr most republicans agree with contraception , abstinence , motherhood , adoption . the minority of catholic republicans who feel contraception are a sin the only ones that the op is viewing , and not the majority of republicans who feel that you need to be practicing safe sex . firstly i do n't think many republicans outside of fringe wingnuts are against birth control . opposing abortion from a pro-life perspective is opposing what they believe to be murder . you can oppose murder whilst also opposing government welfare and forcing people to financially support others . does n't however mean someone can force you to provide for said homeless man for the rest of his life . if by "" support "" you mean free i absolutly do not believe tax payers should be paying for birth control . if by "" support "" you mean supporting the use and availability of birth control sure ; sell it in vending machines , sell it in drug stores , sell it door to door with girl scout cookies i could care less . its a tiny minority of puritans who think putting birth control behind the pharmacy counter with the playboys will somehow stop people from having sex . i 'm anti-abortion , though not anti-birth control , and it kills me that so many republicans are so inconsistent about this issue . i think many republicans like myself -- those of us who still care about federalism -- believe that the government should provide aid where necessary but that this responsibility should be devolved onto state and especially municipal governments , which can more effectively apply the necessary quantity of resources . we also are for more careful application of childcare and support , to make sure that only those who need it get it . we also acknowledge that some wellfare programs incentivise staying unemployed , which is something we 're concerned with fixing . i think it 's fair to say that a lot of republicans are pro-life , but i want to note that most rational people support birth control . well , i think pro-life people truly believe that killing a baby when it 's inside a womb is no different than murdering a person on the street . and although i 'm more pro-choice , i can understand how someone might feel a moral obligation to prevent this from occurring ... just as someone might step in to prevent a husband from stabbing his wife ( etc ) . and say you bravely prevent that wife from being stabbed/killed as an act of moral duty ; are you now on the hook to make sure the wife has a comfortable life because you saved her from dying ? again , i think that 's how pro-life people approach this whole thing . they are simply stepping in to prevent a murder from occurring because they believe it 's their duty to protect those who ca n't protect themselves . i mean i do n’t know about “ republicans ” but go to any pro life organization and you can learn all about all the programs they employ to help disadvantaged children . in other words , "" it should be illegal to kill "" does not require "" everyone should have x provided for them . "" "" pro-life "" is really about a belief that the unborn are living people with rights ( alive ) , and that aborting your unborn child because it would make your life too difficult is morally identical to burying a pair of scissors in your newborn because it makes your life too difficult . as for birth control , i again think you fail to understand our position . we just do n't want our tax dollars paying for you to go out and have sex on our dime when we think sex outside of committed relationships/marriage is stupid , destructive , or wrong . you can oppose active harm to another and oppose massive welfare programs at the same time . for an example , i think it 's wrong and should be illegal to steal a tv . i also would oppose a tax-subsidized program that gives free tvs to people on food stamps . i also would oppose a tax-subsidized program where prostitutes give free sex to incels . i think it 's wrong and should be illegal to kill someone . i also would oppose welfare programs that pay for all of their needs cradle to grave . my question for you is if you think a parent has the right to kill their child up until they are legally adults . if you think they do n't , do you think it 's inconsistent to also think that you do n't bear the responsibility of caring for the kid ? at what point , in your mind , do the beliefs that murder should be illegal and that welfare should provide become seperate ? wherever you draw that line , i bet money that i can quibble over the details and make you out to be an inconsistent monster that does n't really care about kids . not republican , but i think people just do n't want to pay for someone else birth control or abortion . ( if they 're given out for free/subsidized ) therefore , they probably would not want to pay for someone else 's kids . by all means go use birth control , just pay for it yourself . maybe they just support being a responsible adult and living with the consequences of your actions . in fact , republicans are more charitable than democrats both in terms of how many of them give and in terms of what percent of their income they give . republicans do believe in things like supporting families , they just do n't believe that it 's the government 's role . the point of conception is when the child is life . as for child services yes they need to be better , but the excess of children up for adoption is not an excise to kill a baby . conservatives buy the religion-based argument that abortion is either akin to killing a living being or preventing a living being from being created ( thereby working against god 's will ) . i 'm not arguing for or against this opinion , just laying out what the predominant conservative arguments are against abortion . the argument of this demographic on abortion , as best as i can tell , is that a child you have is your responsibility . since you conceive it ( and remember , we 've taken the immorality of abortion as a given here ) you ought to face the consequences . i want to reiterate that this is not my perspective -- i 'm divided about the issue but would lean pro-choice in urgent circumstances like threats to the life of the mother , etc . this is just how i understand conservatives rationalize their arguments . in addition , i do think that at the end of the day this match between pro-life policy and anti-subsidy policy is the product of the political maneuverings of a defensive republican party in the mid to late twentieth century , seeking more votes from different demographics . there is n't really a logical inconsistency in those beliefs , and as a result , there is n't a need for them to push for social programs under their worldview . i think in the vast majority of cases republicans support birth control , hey just do n’t want their taxes going toward providing it for people , they ’d rather those people just practice self control . they only care about life when it ’s in the womb , as soon as you ’re born they believe you should already be paying taxes and fending for yourself or die . i have a simple question that i hope would change your mind . i feel if you cant answer this , you should change your mind : theres a ton of reasons , social , community , heck even national security wise to promote eduction and medicine , but in the end why should i have to support anything for anyone else past what the basic functions of governments should be ? if i “ was ” to take the postion that it was reprehensible to “ murder babies ” , or interfere with the divine spark of conception - that sex was for procreation only ... ( and to be clear i do not ) nothing philosophical , doctrinal , moral or ethical requires me to have to support you for you choices , actions , or even consequences of someone elses actions . i remember that to a various degrees that used to be discussed in the early 2000s , maybe even late 90s , before it became too partisan and therefore too controversial for either side to step back even an inch . most are actually pro birth control and pro making it easier for people to get birth control . no need for birth control or an abortion or welfare . babies should only be born to straight couples who can afford it . of course , people really really like sex and it ’s nearly impossible to stop them from having it . i can assure you that most republicans are not anti birth control . maybe you are conflating anti state provided birth control with anti birth control . we do support a program that helps families raise children . the republicans care about the child until it ’s born . alright i have seen this brought up by a bunch of people already in this thread but you have yet to respond to it , so i 'll make it as a direct response to the op . yes republican views in general are "" you do you and ill stay out of it "" but they also view abortion as murder , and therefor does n't fall into the your body , your choice mantra . therefor it is completely reasonable to be against abortion and against supporting child support programs . disclaimers : keep in mind i am not arguing this is correct , or the best view for society , merely that it holds logical consistency . additionally i would like to keep birth control out of this particular conversation as your op states or not and , so i do n't need to argue that side of things as well . i know plenty of libertarians who think abortion is morally wrong and do n’t support it , but their wish that the government would stop funding planned parenthood is intrinsically ties to their wish that the government would stop funding social programs too i 've heard a lot of republicans criticize the program that makes it more lucrative for a mother to divorce her child 's father and raise the kid that way ; research clearly shows that two parent 's raise more successful children . consequently , conservative are likely to assume that programs designed to make people feel more confident about starting families are likely to produce the opposite effect . there are a lot of republicans that support some abortion and i 've never met a single person on either side of the spectrum that opposes birth control . if a person tries to avoid the negative consequences of their actions by killing an innocent third party they should be prevented from doing so . a person who prevents an innocent from being wrongfully killed does not assume responsibility for the future well being of that innocent on an ongoing basis . do n't make willing parents who have passed the tests and checks pay tens of thousands of dollars , be put through the ringerx given no guarantees , and often lied to . you ca n't take care of a child and you plan to kill it , so i must pay you not to kill it ? the great majority of conservatives do not oppose birth control . if you want to have sex that 's fine , i just do n't see why my tax dollars should pay for it . as for abortion , yes most religious conservatives are against it , not because we think there is a child shortage but because they view it as murder . moving to the next subject , we do n't appose all social programs , i think most conservatives are just annoyed at the sheer number of them and how they can be easily abused . i 'm all for a safety net to help out a family in need but when its structured to keep people trapped in government assistance i have a problem with that . by "" do not support "" birth control , do you mean to say that these republicans do not support government subsidies for birth control , or that they do not support the use of birth control ? they want to leave people screwed over without actively allowing killing people who are guaranteed to be innocent . they see abortion as killing and some see contraception as killing but most who are against contraception are just against pre-marital sex . i think republicans see birth as a right to all and education and healthcare is secondary it makes no sense to insist people have to have the children they do n't want or ca n't afford then insist they have to find away . i believe that people should be responsible for their actions . do n’t have a baby if you ca n’t take care of it . i think people should use birth control ( correctly ) and if you ca n’t take care of a baby , do n’t have sex . i do n’t think abortion should be used as birth control but i would n’t ever discourage anybody from having one if it was their choice . as others have pointed out only a very small group of people are against birth control . as far as abortion , idc i just do n't want my tax dollars paying to keep the places that provide it as a service open . same thing with social programs , i do n't think taxpayers should be paying for people who ca n't keep it in their pants . someone who gets pregnant at 16 , drops out of school , and sells mlm scams their whole life while having 3 kids from 3 different fathers should n't be taken care of by people who worked hard and have a good career path . if you consider a baby / fetus in the womb to be a person , then by definition abortion is homicide and is a very illegal act . if your thinking is more like ancient spartans , then throwing a slightly deformed baby off of a cliff some time after it 's born is okay because they did n't consider the baby a person . our society currently arbitrarily believes that only right out of the womb is a baby entitled to personhood ( and thereby not homicide ) . there is a political party that wants the definition of personhood to include a fetus in the womb . that does not mean you allow murder and homicide to be commonplace , and ( read # 1 ) if a fetus being aborted falls under the category of homicide then you should enforce the law in that area of governance . having liberty means you have the liberty to skateboard , the liberty to break an arm , and the liberty go to a hospital and pay your hospital bill . having liberty also means you have the liberty to get pregnant at a bad time in your life , the liberty to take out loans , seek charity , or do nothing , and the liberty to give up your child to adoption or work very hard to take care of your child . if you want a safety net , you also need a way to pay for a safety net . in many welfare countries ( you likely look up to ) , you legitimately need things like a "" skateboard license "" ( you pay for ) to get "" free "" healthcare for when you break your arm . you could theoretically require people to get a "" have-sex-outside-of-stable-life license "" to pay for that safety net , and you could prosecute people who have sex without a license , but this is n't really the most pleasant path to go down ( arresting people for having sex without a license ... ) . from their perspective it is the parents responsibility to provide for their children . if children grow up in poverty they view it as a failure of the parents not "" government "" . so unplanned pregnancies by people who cant afford their children are not the government ’s problem . i would be fine with people paying for their own abortions and not getting taxpayer money . the ideology of social conservatives and libertarians that lead them to oppose abortion and government-subsidized healthcare can be summed up by the following sentence : the role of government should be to protect folks ' rights first and foremost , and otherwise stay of their lives . since social conservatives see abortion as depraving the unborn of their most fundamental right to life , they oppose abortion . however , since they believe government should otherwise stay out of peoples ' lives , they oppose raising taxes to provide birth control or family supplements . many , like orrin hatch , believe that the government should take a more active role to promote families , and as such would favor family supplements . its almost like theyre using these social issues to trick people into voting against their own economic interest . the point is to develop a class that is permanently dependent on low wage jobs that have little to no security . so , social welfare programs would only open gaps through which these people might escape poverty and gain the tools to accumulate wealth for themselves . why should i help people because they made a mistake - having unprotected sex - just because i dont want them to kill babies because of the mistake ? conservatives do support and promote the idea of helping families and children in need . two , on the belief that government uses funds inefficiently , for the same reason monopolies are inefficient . that is a strictly religious view , and even so most religious people support the use of birth control but just do n't use it for themselves . i fully support the use of birth control , but birth control is n't always 100 % reliable . lots of pregnancies come from failed birth control , a considerable amount of abortions as well . we believe that if you have sex , you assume all risks to start a family , and must be fully ready to . we see abortion as immoral , and thus we believe that you must be fully prepared to have a child if you are willing to have sex . of course this does n't mean we believe that you straight up are n't allowed to have sex if you are n't prepared for a child , but i strongly believe that one should refrain from sexual activity unless they are ready . the issue you run into with these types of debates is assuming each political party is monolithic . i do agree that the republican party has issues with its identity right now . they alternate between religious and small government ideals , as the party is heavily influenced by both groups . that said , each group has a focus , and the differences in focus give the party a dichotomy . so i do n't think the republican party should have any more consistency in view than any other large group of diverse people . i will agree that a person who is against both should show the same support for children after birth , whether through law , community outreach , or the like . per safe haven law ( which i believe is universally supported ) , the child can be left at the hospital without any risk to the mother ( legal or financial ) . as to birth control , i would love to see data on where pro-lifers stand on birth control . better access to birth control is the only reasonable method for reducing the number of abortions . i suspect that most pro-lifers understand this , and have no problem with birth control ."
9ys5bu,"i think gender roles are a good thing because they give you a sense of identity i think it is important for humans to know where they fit into this world . it 's important to feel like the part of a whole . it 's important to understand who we are . this is the point of all traditions . i think that one of the things we do wrong in the west is that we focus too much on personal liberties and too little on community , belonging and shared identity . i believe this is the cause of many of the problems we face today and specifically the cause of the rise in mental illness ( such as anxiety and depression ) . i think increases in personal liberty and the abandonnement of tradition and community go hand in hand with loneliness , a diminshed sense of purpose and belonging and deterioration of mental health . i think it 's very important to feel like we are part of a group . gender roles serve that purpose . boys belong with boys , not in the sense that they ought to be with other boys , but in that it gives them a sense of belonging . that is a good thing . yes , you may argue that the choice to which group you will belong is arbitrary , and not based on anything that really matters , i would counter that no better argument for grouping exists . if it is part of your identity , it has to be immutible , or at least , quite hard to change . therefore , sorting on the basis of an interest or hobby will definitely not work . now here 's a few things i 'm not saying : - i am not defending any of the preconceptions we have about members of a given gender . - i am not saying men ca n't , or should n't cook . - i am not saying women ca n't program or be lumberjacks . - i am not saying either gender is better - i am not saying one gender should be given certain privileges that the other is not - i am not saying there is anything wrong with people that are unable to fit into the predefined roles . - i am definitely not saying we should be intolerant , or hold any kind of prejudice against people that do n't fit these roles . - more disclaimers i am saying that , in the abstract , gender roles can give people a ( shared ) identity and a sense of belonging . a sense of identity and belonging is essential to good mental health . most people ( men and women ) are quite happy with the role they have been given . therefore , in the abstract , the existence of gender roles is a good thing .","some of the off-shoot communities lgbtq + quite likely gain a stronger sense of identity through their identification to their group than i do towards being ' male . ' my personal feeling is that gender roles are basically good and that humans are a very dimorphic species . there is essentially total overlap in the probability distribution of capability ( for any task , save very extreme tasks like lifting 1,000 pounds , which only a few men in the world can do ) . to make it a bit concrete , let 's talk about leadership . if that good leader is a female , it does not matter . also , i wo n't give respect to a female leader just because they are female . they have to be a good leader , not a good leader for a female . gender roles arise as a difference in frequency , not a difference in distribution ranges . you state a lot of thoughts and feelings but nothing really tangible or backed by evidence . gender roles might enforce a certain kind of meaning that you ’re lead to believe is contributing positively to x scenario but i do n’t see any evidence for it giving you a sense of identity . human beings have millions of unique experiences that stratify their individual differences on an infinite spectrum with thousands of causal factors that influence one another in totally ambiguous ways that we most likely will never understand and this is the general equation we all inevitably follow to create what we call an identity . whether you cook and clean or go to work every day does n’t really do anything for your sense of identity . what if you do n't identify with the assigned roles for your gender . why do we not divvy up society based on handedness , or hair texture , or which toe is the longest , or whether or not you have attached earlobes ? these are also immutables ( more immutable than gender , in fact ) that could give identity , but we do n't assign roles to these positions because we know that it 's dumb to categorize people according to these traits . there was a time when we always used outhouses , but we 're generally content with having left that behind because there 's obvious problems with it . when i see people who do all this i see them stress out a lot in particular with whether they fit it . people are realy concerned whether they are "" masculine "" or "" feminine "" enough and the people that do n't care live a chill life so i disagree . well mental health is doing very well in individualist countries compared to collectivist ones ; there 's a book called "" dutch women do n't get depressed "" and one of the reasons it cites is that they do n't experience a lot of the pressures and problems a lot of females in other countries face to do with "" being feminine "" and can be very relaxed about life and do n't have to worry about their appearance and makeup too much . yet all these modern "" world citizen "" genderless people who just isten to the music they like and do n't worry about fitting in or belonging seem very happy and it mostly seems to be a course of stress for people that they constantly worry about the peer pressure and the conformance to their identity . the problem with totalitarian ideologies is that they are sub par , to the personal liberty system in most cases . worse education , unrealized potential , rampant spread of homophobia in regards to sexualities or life styles , rampant xenophobia in regards to minorities , etc. . then of course we have the "" community paradox "" , where totalitarian aproaches ( for example nations , or religious groups ) tend to be vastly more isolationist . and abandonement of customs , traditions and classical clicks and communities is only single variable in a see of variables . the trade of is unprecedented comfort , physical health , life expectancy , historically low crime rate , historically longest period of peace , global community , global trade , etc. . it does n't make sense to abandon lifestyle that provides just too many benefits . the trade off , is worse social skills , harder barriers of entry for disadvantaged gender , vastly lowered inteligence of given group , worse mental health problems for the disadvantaged gender , worse economic standing of the disadvantaged group , etc. . from utilitarian perspective , it would make more sense to let people filter in and out a group , to find the best possible fit for them personally . i conform with almost amount none of the traditional “ gender roles ” for men . but if i did , i think my sense of identity would be way out of wack . conversely , when i do things like sing , bake pies , act in a play , ( all of these being the “ female gender roles ” ) i do have a sense of identity . for all the male chefs , the female programmers or even just non-binary people , this “ gender-role ” thing does more bad than good . is n't it inherent that if society accepts and embraces gender roles , that society begins to not only encourage them , but impose them ? we saw this for a large chunks of history -- whether you want to go back as far as saying women were strictly property ( as part of their imposed role of child-bearers and raisers ) , women being unable to vote ( because political decisions were not a concern for the homemakers ) , etc . you can even look to today where the concept of gender roles is being eroded , but there are still fields ( e.g. engineering ) where women are tacitly pushed away . i do n't think it 's possible to separate the idea that we should have gender roles with the reality that gender roles remove personal liberty in practice ( through cultural pressure ) . "" women should be housewives "" is an example of a gender role , an expectation of what a particular gender should do . "" male "" is a gender , a psycho-social identity marker that usually develops in very early childhood alongside other identity markers such as family association , and which is expressed in different ways in different cultures through gender roles and gender expression . gender expression is how a person dresses and acts in relation to their gender identity . your argument seems to be gender roles reinforce gender , which is a part of identity and identity is good therefore gender roles are good . gender roles describe a specific way to perform a gender . if your goal is for people to broadly identify with gender then promoting specific ways to perform that gender is going to make more people struggle to identify with it . so if you ask an american to write 10 things about themself they 'll generally open with stuff like "" i 'm an athlete "" or "" i 'm a psychology student "" and most of their list will be like that while a japanese person is more likely to say "" i 'm part of the psychology department at x univeristy "" and "" i 'm on baseball team y "" and more of their list will be about their role in a group or community or their relationship to other people ( they 'll generally say they 're an older sibling or citizen of a certain area before the american ) . this phenomena extends to lots of other areas where we actually look at and draw pictures differently . if you ask an american to draw a house a tree and a person outside of it they 'll generally draw them all sort of next to each other but a japanese person will tend to draw them in a meaningful relation to one another . the collectivist person draws those things as a collective unit while the individualistic person just draws the three things near each other . that said , the statement "" i think increases in personal liberty and the abandonnement of tradition and community go hand in hand with loneliness , a diminshed sense of purpose and belonging and deterioration of mental health . "" a lack of community leads to lonliness and poor mental health , but tradition and liberty do n't correlate as well . additionally , the ability to feel like part of a community is better served by giving people access to more communities they want to belong to . a school with 50 clubs will foster community better than a school with a strong sense of tradition . also "" if it is part of your identity , it has to be immutible , or at least , quite hard to change . "" my identity as a psychologist and a gamer are both pretty central to who i am but in no way immutable or difficult to change the way gender or national origin are . they 're also much more important to me than my identity as a man or a canadian because i chose them . i sought out those things , i found community among those people , i formed relationships and learned what those communties stood for and have a meaningful say ( as much as anyone else in the community ) in shaping those things as well as the right to walk away if i think they 're wrong . it is n't a home i moved into , it 's a box i 'm not allowed to leave . next up , you say "" i think it 's very important to feel like we are part of a group . boys belong with boys , not in the sense that they ought to be with other boys , but in that it gives them a sense of belonging "" . your list of bullet points of things are all aspects of gender roles . the male gender role is n't "" be with other boys "" it 's "" do these things that women are n't supposed to and do n't do these things that women are supposed to "" . when something becomes acceptable for both med and women in equal measure it generally stops being part of a gender role . wearing pants used to be part of the male gender role . wearing a dress is part of the female gender role because men are expected not to do it . gender roles , by their very nature , are about what half the population is n't allowed to do and what they are expected to do regardless of if they want to or not . one quote from a person with gender dysphoria i think is worth mentioning here "" it do n't know that i ever originally wanted to be a woman . you 're basically saying "" i think gender roles are good as long as they do n't function as gender roles in any way "" . finally , the male gender role particularly , actively impedes males from forming close connections that are an important part of good mental health . men are socialized to be less likely to seek out other people 's help , to open up , to be vulnerable or empathetic . these are all so important to building community and relationships that foster good mental health . so even if the abstract concept of gender roles do do what you 're suggesting the actual real gender roles we have do the opposite to such a significant degree that you 're trading a single step forward for a dozen steps back . if you 're the kind of person that likes to fit in some particular position in a society and belong , then the existence of a role you can fit into is good . so , gender roles work for people who like gender roles , and do n't work for people who do n't like gender roles . i do n't think this is particularly useful since it solves nothing for people who do n't happen to fit in ."
9yrvy7,"a muslim woman can marry a non muslim man this has been quite an issue for a personal relationship and so i have done a lot of reading . from everything that i have read , the idea that a muslim man can marry a woman of the book but not vice versa , is an interpretation . here is from a post online i have found . “ in the qur ’ an , there is only one verse that clearly tackles this issue . it is absolutely the main verse that states a provision on marriage with a category of non-muslims . allah says : “ do not marry idolatresses ( al mushrikāt ) till they believe ; and certainly a believing maid is better than an idolatress even though she would please you ; and do not marry idolaters ( al mushrikīn ) till they believe ( hata yūminū ) , and certainly a believing slave is better than an idolater , even though he would please you . these invite to the fire , and allah invites to the garden and to forgiveness by his grace , and makes clear his revelations to mankind so that they may remember . ” qur ’ an 2:221 . through this qur ’ anic order , the verse clearly forbids the marriage of the believing men and women to polytheists , called at the time “ mushrikīn ” . we should be aware of the fact that this order made sense because it was revealed at the time when polytheists ( al-mushrikīn ) were engaged in a merciless war against the believing muslims . it is also worth reminding that polytheists were belonging to an aristocratic class of obscene wealth and indecent conduct , and whose lifestyle was reconsidered by the new social values of fairness and equity of islam . while the qur ’ an acknowledges the possibility of a mutual attraction between a believer , man or woman , and a polytheist , it strongly recommends against such alliance . the verse seems to urge muslim men and women to choose the modest believing slaves over the rich arrogant polytheists even if the latter would look more attractive than the poor slaves . this allusion to “ slaves ” ( men and women ) is quite indicative of the moral values that the qur ’ anic revelation tended to inculcate in people . on the one hand , the qur ’ an showed “ tolerance ” towards the fact of slavery that was universally common at the time ; on the other hand , it sought to break the first chains of social hierarchy by preferring these “ poor ” believing slaves to those wealthy people who formed the elite then . by getting married to slaves regardless of their social hardship , islam encouraged muslims to value people on other basis than their social class , and henceforth ; find a balance between the differences established by the ethnic-tribal system at that time . furthermore , the new believers needed to be protected from polytheists ’ abuse who considered this new religion of islam as a threat to their own interests . the qur ’ an urges muslim men and women to get married to believers who had , like them , such faith awareness and were conscious of justice on earth . the purpose was to absolutely avoid the marriage of muslims to polytheists who made every effort to stand against a religion that was defending the most vulnerable people on earth . muslim men and women were , therefore , encouraged to get married to those who believe , like them , in one god symbolizing a monotheism purified from all other divinities and injustice . thus , the said verse stipulates that muslim men and women are allowed to contract marriage with believers ( mu ’ minīn ) and prohibited to marry polytheists ( mushrikīn ) . it is worth mentioning that the the qur ’ anic verse clearly stresses the totally egalitarian approach in favor of both men and women and which is not confusing at all . the qur ’ anic order is addressed to both men and women on an equal footing . “ -- url -- i believe that this interpretation has been made to protect the religion in the family . the children will then follow islam and so on . the father being a muslim will make sure that the children definitely follow islam however if the father was a christian for example , the children would be expected to follow christianity . therefore , my belief is also that these interpretations have been made for a family to have a conflict free marriage in those regards .","my only hard argument is "" idolaters "" while quite possibly originally meant to mean polytheists , can mean any god other than their own . now to be clear i was raised catholic and have no clue about 90 % of the muslim faith this is just my small amount of knowledge of a few muslim friends and the piece you wrote plus my understanding of how many religious people see the issue .... it seems like the text is saying no muslim should marry an unbeliever , regardless of their sex . in my experience , religious people tend to first abandon the rules their religions proscribe for them and really only fight for the rules that others are supposed to follow . the passage you selected from the qur ’ an appears to specifically focus on believing men and women and polytheists . however , your post title specifically talks about beliving women and non-believing men ."
9yqvzk,"the republican christian objection to tax as charity because tax is not voluntary is ultimately hypocritical as a left leaning british christian , i come from a tradition where the left commonly identifies with christianity ( the nhs was started by christians , free education for all was championed by christian reformers , christians lead the abolition of slavery fight etc ) . part of this logic is that the acceptance of taxation is akin to charity , ie we give up what is by most definitions our money , to give to a cause that benefits those less fortunate , as well as broader society . in the us however , christians it seems more commonly identify with the right , and when i argue that , for instance , us christians should be in support of universal healthcare funded through taxation , because christians are okay with charity , the counter response is something to the effect of "" but charity is voluntary , where as taxation is compulsory "" and so therefore taxation is n't comparable here and thus taxpayer funded universal healthcare is n't something they would support . the problem i have with this logic is that it 's basically undermined by the us-christian-right wing outlook on many other issues . if their argument is that because taxation is involuntary and compelled through force of law , how do they then see it as so important that force of law be used to enforce against gay marriage for instance . in fact , this argument goes even further . surely this is basically the same as an argument for abolishing the state . if us-christian-republicans basically argue that something is not holy if it is compelled through force of law , why then are they so often very law-and-order focused . if they do not think the law is an apropriate force to compel charity , why it is okay to use the law to compel other "" christian "" behaviours , such as temperance ( because us-christian-republicans are often very opposed to the use of recreational drugs etc ) . so in summary , i 'd like to see a compelling reason why a the american-christian-republican perspective can oppose taxation-as-charity because the state should not enforce generosity but can support police-enforced-morality because the state should enforce good citizenship .","if it 's just for the government to enforce one aspect of morality , why not in others ? in principle , this argument works both ways , and if one side can come up with some explanation ( usually a practical one ) that can explain why their side is n't hypocritical , should n't it be easy for the other side to do the same ? just wanted to address this little part as it 's a bit missinformed . the christian right in the us do n't want ' the force of law ' be used to prevent gay marriage . the argument is that gay marriage should n't be endorsed by the government by recognizing it as equal under the law . it 's still homophobic and makes no sense , but they do n't want to use the law to prevent gay marriage , they just do n't want the law supporting it . something you ’re forced to do has little moral significance when you ’re not making a choice out of personal kindness or compassion . nothing about this view of charity turns on whether legal obligations are “ holy ” in general . it may be holy to render unto caesar even if caesar compels it — or it may be holy to defy caesar if caesar compels the unconscionable ; there ’s no categorical rule , and neither has any bearing on whether involuntary contributions are a form of charity . and tocqueville , as dalrymple notes elsewhere , drew the same conclusions long ago : american christians do n't believe that force of law should be used to enforce against gay marriage . many believe that force of law should n't be used to enforce for gay marriage . they believe ( incorrectly imo ) that gay marriage is an oxymoron , and the government should n't recognize those marriages . most do believe the law should compel some taxes to help the poor . separately , it should n't try to be the whole solution because the us government is ponderous and acts in some terrible ways ( for instance , making eligibility for certain government benefits dependent on being single , thus tearing apart families ) . how can you call anyone who pays required taxes and gives no charity on his own "" generous "" - no matter how rich he is and therefore how high his taxes are , that man is a miser . some are secular such as believing that the government should not be in charge of those things , while others are of a religious nature . the biggest religious one that you seem to not quite grasp is that for something to be the religious act of charity it has to be the voluntary sacrifice of your money/property/time / labor/etc in order to qualify . so if you take all the things normally handled by charities and churches and have the government do them via taxation you have literally made it so that christians can not do one of the acts that are a defining command for their religion . as for the anti-gay marriage ( which is still illegal in the uk ) is more of a philosophy that the government should not be involved in marriage . to them it is a religious vow , not a secular one and they do not want the government to legitimize something they see as being abhorrent and sinful by recognizing it to the same degree as their religious weddings ."
9ypakg,"you should be mindful of others while exercising your own freedoms . nowadays i see a lot more protests and just people generally wanting to assert their rights despite it causing obvious stress for unrelated people . my view is that i think that people should be mindful of other while they are being themselves . essentially that even if they have the right to be somewhere or to do something , they should exercise self control for consideration of others . however this is a subjective topic , i ca n’t really give you absolute rules in my logic but essentially i believe people should n’t be selfish when asserting their rights . i think the majority of the examples that i can think of are protest-related for example : 1 . you should n’t protest in a public space like a library or hallway where it will affect the people unrelated/uninterested in your cause . they have their own daily agendas and even though you are not outright infringing on their rights , you should n’t unnecessarily make their lives more difficult . much like blocking traffic too during protests . 2 . another example i can think of is public spaces like the beach or spaces with children , i know it ’s your right and your body . but even if the beach doesnt have rules on dress codes please do n’t wear anything borderline nudity . families often go there for a family time . 3 . but in events like gay pride events where it is expected that there are some risqué costumes , i do n’t think it is selfish because the date was set specifically for that event . all participants that go there should expect a certain amount of nudity or risqueness . much like the library example , if the library is holding a protest event , i do n't think it 's selfish to be loud and disruptive because that space has been reserved . or like how you should expect traffic to be blocked during a pride event . & #x200b ; to summarize : i know it is your right to be who you are and sometimes you need to think about yourself , but there are others around you and should think about them too .","you 're assuming i have an obligation to care about how my actions impact others . to your second : personally i think nudity should not be as stigmatized or considered almost taboo , but i take your point and am usually personally mindful of others ."
9yo9lp,"we already have a de facto multi-party system in the u.s. ( ignoring the green , libertarian and constitution party ) and we need to start treating it as such . obviously , on the surface , we are still divided by r and d. however , if you look within the two parties there is varying degrees of discord between members of the same party . & #x200b ; within the democratic party you have people like joe donnelly d-in ( former ) , alexandria ocasio-cortez d-ny , and nancy pelosi d-ca . three different people with three different ideas about not only the purpose of government but also the ways in which that purpose should be recognized . on the democrat side all you have to do is look at some of the people that talk on reddit about the party ; progressives will argue that establishment dems should step out of their way and the est. dems will argue the progressives need to calm down a bit . & #x200b ; within the republican party the diversity of opinion is definitely shrinking , but you still have people like doug lamborn r-co who can vote fairly rank and file with donald trump whereas people like rand paul r-ky will only vote with the president 74 % of the time . rand paul even got into heated disagreements with john mccain r-az ( former ) . & #x200b ; i would argue that with all these differences between members of the same party , we already exist within a de facto multi-party system that just has intensely strong alliances a la the cdu/csu alliance of germany where though they may support each other in several ways , they are still different from each other . & #x200b ; further , i would say that we need to start pushing these differences in the parties more than we currently do . as of right now , i would theorize that the average voter ( especially those who vote straight-tickets ) does not recognize these differences . by making these differences more noticeable , we can cause people to be more thoughtful in their votes , or ( as i would personally desire ) see these two official parties finally split into left , moderate left , moderate right , and right and allow for better representation of what the people believe and want to see from their government ( i understand this is a pipe dream since our fptp electoral system breeds a two party system ) .","the parties control a large central fundraising apparatus and the nomination process . i 'm pretty sure that committee assignments and other procedural things also favor the central control of a party , but i 'm not confident enough in my understanding of that . according to fivethirtyeight , he only votes with trump 93.5 % of the time . in a True multi-party system , you could vote for a moderate joe donnelly-type candidate in ny or ma if you wanted to and a moderate john mccain-type candidate in tn or ms. dems and reps have big tents because everyone wants some of that sweet party machine money . a lot of blue dog dems have gotten primaried lately , just at tea partiers primaried the so-called rinos . major electoral reform would be required to change america to multi-party system . if you do n't live in an area where a progressive or alt-right candidate is running , then you only get to vote for establishment ds and rs . two parties decide who gets to run in every race . i understand that there are primaries and caucuses , but if the 2016 democratic presidential primary showed anything it 's that the party decides who runs but funneling support to the candidates it thinks will win ( both parties ) . the parties find candidates that fit the local profile of a district and run with them . so yeah , it 's a hard core two party system . only 2 independents and no other parties are represented and the independents both caucus with the same party . the democrat and republican parties both pick the candidates before the people do so how could you say anyone has any control outside the two main parties ."
9ynvhe,"there is no such thing as reverse-racism . racism is racism . i have a very strong stance on this but i really would like to hear some logical and rational explanations for why there is such a thing as reverse racism . before we delve into this i 've got to lay out what my definition of reverse-racism is - basically when any people group/ethnicity is racist towards another people group/ethnicity due to the other group being racist/oppressive to the first group . i 've heard reverse-racism a lot on the news , i 've also heard it said many times from my peers regarding white people/minority people group interactions . as a mixed race person i 've seen in my own family racism from all sides and i really do n't see the validity in the term . time after time whether it be on social media or even out in public , i have heard the notion that if you are a minority you are n't a racist if you think less of european/white/caucasian people as it is "" just a natural reaction "" . honestly i just do not buy it as the 2 minority heritages i come from have both been oppressed violently , systematically and socially . i still do not have white guilt being my 3rd heritage is mixed european american . to give some context i 'm a young adult , i have a dual citizenship i am a citizen of the united states of america and a citizen of a federally recognized tribe - sovereign nation within our nation ( american indian/native american/indigenous however you would wish to call it ) . i am also 4th generation asian american descent . as for political parties i choose not to pick democrat or republican or libertarian or any of that . i ca n't honestly say i am a neutral either - i read for myself and do my own research and do not just listen to alphabet news . i hope we can have a good and calm cool collected discussion about this topic .","i think this should be changed ( "" anti-white "" to "" anti-majority "" and "" black people "" to "" minority "" ) but if this how we are defining "" reverse racism "" , then it does exists . holding one race back in favor of another is racism . some will say too much - we ca n't favor one person over another just because they are a minority - that 's not fair . my kids are mixed too , and i hope that race , racism , and reverse racism get less and less important as they and generations that follow grow beyond such arbitrary concepts . not trying to be cheap , but racism is defined as race-based prejudice . the opposite of prejudice ca n't be specific tolerance , because it would create prejudice by displacement . therefore , the opposite of prejudice , or "" reverse-racism "" , would be equal tolerance of people from any race . clearly it is possible for people of any race to hate or look down on people of another race purely because of their race . after all , it 's square , and it has four legs , and it has a flat top . those are characteristics of a table , ergo , that little flat thing should really be called a table . what matters is whether my proposed terminology catches on , and what 's most likely to make it catch on is if it makes concepts easier to group and discuss and think about and analyze . if communication about furniture is easier an more natural in a world where footstools are called "" tables "" , then people will eventually adopt it . so , back to racism , when people are discussing "" racism "" does it usually make things more clear , better mentally organized , if we lump black-on-white and white-on-black racism into a single concept , or if we we attempt to separate them ? there is another way i have heard reverse racism described , and that way is in-group racism : whites discriminating against whites , asians against asians , blacks against blacks etc . but what most people consider reverse racism is simply minority to majority racism . the subtle irony of the directionality metaphor is what makes it ineffective but racism from the minority to majority can and does exist . like when someone says racism the general public is gon na think white guy oppressing minority . it also helps get over the issue where the two sides disagree on the definition of racism with some further left groups claiming racism can only happen to minorities in which case the term is used to kind of attempt to open a dialouge . for far right wingers using the term it kind of helps distance their beleiefs from what they are critiqieing . both sides essentially use it as a term to get over an issue of symantics to better open up what they want to discuss ."
9ylni0,"democracy will , like plato said , always decrade into tyranny there are a few examples in history to back this theory up , famous ones are ofcourse nazi germany but also the roman empire . germany is kinda tricky , seeing that hitler used a fail in the democratic system to become the dictator , still it was a democracy that turned into a tyranny rome , was a kingdom , turned into a republic , but at the end of the republic , caesar tried taking all the power , and was very likely to succeed in this , seeing that the people loved him . so if he was n't killed he had become the first emperor . but he was killed , still rome turned into a tyranny of some sorts with the emperor being at top . not all emperors were bad ofcourse , the same goes for the kings in history but the principle stays the same . now there are also some examples in ancient greece with democracies degrading into tyrannies , and visa versa .","and would n’t the reign of caesar and augustus after the roman republic be closer to an oligarchy or timocracy than a tyranny ? i would n’t call napoleon a tyrant either , and the english republican government under cromwell was replaced with a constitutional monarchy . it ’s hard to deny that if a democracy ends a non-democratic government will follow it . most historians would n’t see the reigns of napoleon , caesar and charles ii as being periods of bad government . plato was writing with a fundamentally different understanding of democracy than you . in plato ’s democracy , the democratic man is slave to , and able to act on his baser emotions . plato did not in include checks and balances in his theory of democracy and so the risk of a toquevillian tyranny of the majority is much greater . a better view of democracy is that it has evolved since plato described it ( plato was likely biased as he would have considered democracy to be responsible for socrates ’ execution ) and that a True democracy is one with appropriate checks and balances to avoid tyranny . given enough time and changing circumstances , no form of government is permanently stable and democracies will become tyrannies , but other tyrannies will become democracies , and some of these countries will split into pieces or united or get a different form of government altogether . seeing that we a positive number of democracies now , we have , by definition , seen more examples democracy emerging than of democracy ending . greek democracy lasted just a couple of hundred years in one city state , the roman republic ~ 450 , the weimar republic like 15 . democracy is a slow way of govern but a better one as compared to a authoritarian or a dictatorship . yes , there have been mishaps in the past but through those mishaps democracy improves on itself . compare it to any form of ruling which is ruling with an iron fist democracy is a much better option in the long run . would n't you say there are countless more examples , especially modern ones , that are living examples that democracies are not destined to degrade into tyranny ? yes , democratic systems can be hijacked by tyrannical individuals to get into power , but i would n't say that history shows that as an inevitable course for democracy . i know it is the colloquial term for everything in modern english , but a democracy in plato 's day is not the same thing as a representative republic . plato lived in athens , an actual ( limited ) democracy , and had good friends die from the tyranny of the majority . but representational democracy , by diffusing power and setting up walls internally in the government , has a much better chance of not sinking into chaos and dictatorship than any other form of government i 'm aware of . it is just as likely as any other ship to hit an iceberg , but the watertight compartments mean it may not sink . just because titanic sank does n't mean watertight compartments are a bad idea , it means that titanic had badly designed ones ."
9ylhuw,"i find it somewhat suspicious that when feminists/progressives/liberals talk about gender parity/equality in the workplace seem to focus almost exclusively on stem , politics , and ceo/high-level leadership positions . just to define terms , "" gender parity/equality in the workplace "" here refers to having an equal amount of men and women in the workplace , or at least representation that reflects the gender demographics of the surrounding area . i understand that equality in the workplace is sometimes used to refer to , say , the issue of workplace harassment , and i take no issue with that , but it 's not what i 'm looking to address here . also just to clarify , this post is n't about the value of having more women in certain fields ( be it from a social justice point of view , a profit driven motive , or both ) and it is n't about the reasons why there might be more women in some fields and more men in others ( e.g. life-work balance , women more interested in people/men more interested in things , etc. ) . there 's a lot of good discussion to be had over those two subjects , but i feel they 'd be fairly off-topic here . correct me if i 'm wrong about that . right , so , pretty much every time i hear about the lack of gender equality in the workplace , the workplaces in question are almost invariably stem , politics , or ceo/high-level leadership positions ( which i 'll shorten to just "" ceo "" for the remainder of this post ) . when i specifically look for evidence that there 's a push to get more women into other areas , like , say , construction , i can sometimes find evidence of it . but it seems far less prevalent ( and reported on/discussed by less mainstream outlets/companies ) than stem , politics , and ceo positions . and this makes me suspicious of the motives of people who claim to care about gender equality in the workplace while only focusing on these fields . as far as professions go , the three in question do n't tend to employ large numbers of people . as far as gender disparities go the three fields in question are n't even the most egregious offenders : there 's been much lamentation about how women only account for about a quarter of all stem positions , so surely there should be even greater outrage over the fact they only make up \ ~ 1 % of , say auto mechanics . well , where is it ? where are all the forbes and cnbc and apa articles about the lack of female auto mechanics ? where 's the un initiative to get more women working on cars for a living ? now to my main point \ [ straightens tin-foil hat \ ] : call me crazy but i think those people who claim to care about gender equality in the workplace but focus primarily if not exclusively on stem , politics , and ceo positions have some ulterior motives . what those three fields all have in common is that they 're some combination of high-earning , high-prestige , and high-influence . if you want workplace equality in principle , it 'd make sense to target pretty much any field with an imbalance , and arguably those fields that employ larger numbers of people with more egregious gender disparities than stem , politics , and ceos . there are much bigger fish out there in need of frying . and i think the reason these three smaller fish have been chosen has less to do with True gender equality and more with wanting to shoehorn women into positions that garner wealth , status , and/or power . do you think , for example , that the reason feminists/progressives/liberals tend to focus on the lack of female ceos and not the lack of female electricians might , just might have something to do with the fact ceos average annual takehome is like 15x what electricians make ? do you think the comparative repute and power that comes with working in politics might be the reason they 've honed in on politics and not sewage treatment ? in short , when feminists/progressives/liberals focus on the three fields in question beyond all others , the message they 're sending out is n't that they care about workplace equality , it 's that they want women to have the good jobs . the dangerous , physically-demanding , thankless , low-paying , low-influence jobs ? ... nahh . men can keep those . as a semi-related aside i think it 's also rather telling that people who claim to care about gender equality generally only seem to care about fields that are male-dominated . there does n't seem to be a lot of effort to , say , get more men into nursing , or even facets of stem that women dominate . one counterargument i 've thought of might be that if we want to enact more gender equality at the "" top level , "" so to speak , in order to enact change throughout the workforce as a whole . "" trickle down gender equality , "" if you will . i think this is unconvincing for two reasons : first , because ime trickle down anything rarely seems to work , but second , and mainly , because while i could see how getting more female ceos or stem professionals is a great first step to getting even more female ceos or stem professionals ( aspiring women would have more female role-models , like minded mentors mentors , see the fields as less hostile to women , etc. ) , i do n't see how that could or would translate across professions . in short i do n't see how getting more women in stem will automatically result in more female truckers , or how getting more female ceos will increase the female presence in mining . to cmv i 'm basically looking for some reason why it 's justified for those claiming to champion workplace equality to be so laser-locked on three specific fields . if they claim to care about workplace equality and think it 's not just a good thing for social justice reasons but also just makes good business sense , why are those the three fields that they focus on almost exclusively ? or , of course , some other cmving explanation i have n't thought of . but that 's why you 're here . y' all know what to do . cheers .","referencing stem jobs in the argument about equality is justified because for the last decade + stem jobs have been the emerging field of growth , this has tangential relationship to stem company ceo management positions but i wo n't address it more than that . so the going in position if you were to ask a guidance counselor , college admissions panel , job placement support person from university , "" what field should i go into for a better chance at a job with a good salary and growth potential "" stem was and likely still is the answer . so once there is a basis for agreeing that stem jobs are the desirable fields/positions etc . you have a segment of jobs to check on gender gaps in placement into that field . you 'll have to correct for percentages of men vs women graduating stem curriculum , adjust for prominence/quality of institution ( ivy vs community college etc. ) . then ensure that there are no bias ' ing factors like a preponderance of scholarships for a specific gender that would inflate participation in advanced education of one gender . and compare that corrected ratio of men/women between education and jobs . i wo n't speak to whether or not there is an under-representation of one gender in stem . but none the less you can see why stem jobs are referenced in the crux of the argument for equality . this whole thing can play out again when comparing salaries for similar levels of experience once in a stem field , but starting salaries is a cleaner reference point . and if one gender is under represented in the desirable fields/jobs , it might be indicative of bias in the field . jobs that require physical strength are pretty obvious : either you can hack it as a lumberjack ( nailed it ) or an electrician or you ca n't . there are men who ca n't do physical labor , and we 're not so dumb as a society as to think everyone can do that kind of work all day . jobs like ceo and other fields rely on one 's brain , and other intangible skills that you ca n't really measure . it 's easy to talk about these types of jobs because it 's humans working with other humans and doing things to them . i mean , there was a big supreme court decision just three years ago that was a huge victory for women facing discrimination in the coal mining industry . there are lots of articles about getting men into nursing or getting women into trades . the sexist joke that comes to mind is that feminists complain about everything , not just stem , political , and ceo positions . but the real point is that they are dedicated to equality in all fields . if there is a bias towards news articles about prestigious , high paying positions , it 's because america is a capitalist , consumerist country . money and power are the focuses of most magazines including us news listing the most prestigious schools , forbes ranking billionaires , time picking a person of the year , people picking the sexiest person , etc . even articles in national geographic about indigenous tribes in the amazon are posted next to ads for rolexes and louis vuitton handbags . my look on it is ; if you were told you could n’t be a ceo , you ’d be more mad then if you were told you could n’t be a mechanic . with the exception of people who have a passion for a trade most men and women alike would rather have the higher paying flashier job . if you are distributing beautiful gems on one hand , and dung on the other hand , and give them unequally to two different groups , the group that got shafted is n't going to care that they did n't get enough dung . there are a lot of low status jobs for both men and women . for equality , you do n't need an equal number of men and women electricians . you just need the low status jobs not to go disproportionately to one group . if only men did low status jobs , that would be a problem . but plenty of women do low status jobs as well , such as nurse , grade school teacher , cleaning lady , social worker , secretary , and so on . the whole point of gender equality is that women and men have equal opportunities in life . excluding women from high paying , powerful positions is the problem . yes , few activists care about making the genders perfectly identical , only about ending systemic injustices such as one gender holding most of the political , economic , and cultural power over society , ( a.k.a. inequality ) . you are talking about feminists , a movement that fights against gender inequality against women , and tries to counter it with empowerment , not about egalitarians who just randomly want to make the genders more similar to each other , while already presuming that their differences are already equitable . if most politicians would be women , while most ceos are men , but most media creators were women , while most military officers were men , while most academics were women while most engineers were men , then plenty of feminists would explicitly say that they have reached their goal of social equality , and this on it 's own is fine . case in point : notice how there is no widespread social movement for the equality of left-handed people , even though they statistically excel at different life choices than right-handed people . because left-handed people already are equal , in the sense that they have equitable treatment and power , which is all that social justice movements clearly care about . why would it be a bad thing for women to complain about their lack of access to jobs like that ? that is one of the reasons for the pay difference is that men tend to work these high earning jobs a lot more . hell , even many of the men working them might not want them , but it might be all that is available . the feminists/progressives/liberals i know are all very supportive of getting more men in elementary teaching roles . in reading this it seems to me as though there are two different issues : the motivations of those advocating for this "" top down "" type of gender parity/equity , and whether this strategy is effective . in order to believe that the "" lefties "" have ulterior motives , it requires you to also believe that they do n't think the "" top down "" strategy is effective . so is your view that this approach is ineffective , that lefties "" know "" it 's ineffective yet advocate for it anyway because of some ulterior motive , or both ? it 's justified because when we talk about gender disparity in the workplace , we are n't really talking about the simple act of "" having a job "" . women already have no problem getting lots of "" physically-demanding , thankless , low-paying , low-influence jobs "" like cleaning services , hostessing , child/elder care and retail . i think the reason that "" politics , stem and ceo 's "" are used regularly as examples is because what we 're really talking about is inequity in career progression opportunities . it 's "" why ca n't i continue progressing in that job like my male counterparts do ? "" women account for about 55 % of the total retail industry labor force so i would n't call that a "" male dominated "" industry . when you go up to first/mid level management ( supervisors , asms , sms ) that drops to 42 % . when you continue upward to executive/senior level management that drops further to 28.9 % . board executives drops to 19.9 % and ceos sit at only 5.6 % so the inequity does n't exist in the access to "" jobs "" the inequity exists in the access to career growth . women hold 44 % of job within the federal government , not a massive inequity but when you start to go upward that number drops . only 30 % of senior executive service positions are help by women and there are only 3 women in the current cabinet . women represent only 24 % of the total legislative seats at the state level and only 19.4 % of the total seats at the federal level . i do n't think it 's suspicious to have an expectation that if we account for xyz % of the bottom rung of a given industry we also represent xyz % of the top rung of that same industry . conversely , if we have no representation at the bottom rung of a given industry ( say construction ) due to a lack of desire to enter said industry , i would n't magically expect for us to disproportionately be represented at the top . your post 's topic seems to be fairly common on this subreddit . similar posts can be found through our [ deltalog search ] ( -- url -- + | + feminist & restrict"
9yl907,"anything can and should be joked about in the right context i believe that , in the right context , anything can and should be joked about . to say that some topics must never be made light of gives too much power to those things . for example , joking about the holocaust , while not always situationally appropriate , helps us process the tragedy and reinforces that we won and that we are n’t letting nazis hold that power over us any more . to say it ’s never okay to joke about it is to give them and the event power over us , while making a joke out of it is the ultimate insult to nazis and hitler . essentially , making a joke out of serious topics gives us power and takes away the negative power of those serious topics . now , i ’m not saying you should always tell jokes about serious topics . do n’t make holocaust jokes with a survivor unless they make it clear they ’re okay with it . do n’t make dead baby jokes around someone who miscarried unless they make it clear they ’re okay with it . however , if someone tries to be offended on the behalf of others but has no actual personal ties to the topic , then joke away . in that case , the offended party is in the wrong . tl ; dr : as long as there ’s either nobody with a personal connection to a serious topic or those with the connection give the okay , anything can be joked about . telling jokes about serious topics helps us cope and takes away the negative power of those topics .","personally , it 's very very hard to make me angry , upset , or offended . you tell me a joke , and if it 's in good taste , i 'll laugh , regardless of the topic . if anything making a joke about the killing of jews , where the jews are put in a position where they are less than human would give more power to the nazis . it would make it seem ok to dehumanize and kill jews because they are less than . i would make a distinction between the moral value of telling a joke in one specific context and how that singular action may contribute to an aggregate harm . for instance , it may be that any joke can theoretically be done right in the context its expressed in , but it may be that telling a thousand jokes like it , each done right in their own way , may in sum weigh against the virtue of the joke teller . for instance , i can tell a few great jokes at the expense of gay people , such that the gay people present all agree it was funny . but if that expense softens the stigma against offending gay people , it may in some way that is difficult to measure , contribute to future contexts in which real harms are committed . is one of your contexts only telling these jokes to friends you have know will not be offended if so how do you know they wo n't be offended ? , like for instance would you tell a rape joke at a party if you did n't know how a friend would react or if there was a person in your company who you were merely acquaintances ? how would you react if a friend or someone who hears one of your jokes tell you they are offended by the joke or topic in the joke ? i think that the contextual circumstances matter a great deal . joking about the holocaust immediately after the holocaust would have been inherently unwelcome , and it would have diminished the insane suffering people went through . i think that violence against women is a currently a major issue , and therefore think all jokes about rape and domestic violence are generally unwelcome . i can see how lightly poking at those topics in exactly the right context might be funny , but in the vast majority of contexts , i think joking about violence against women contributes to the culture of not taking harassment , intimate partner violence , and rape seriously enough . i think an exception also exists here for survivors who use humor about their situation to process and communicate their experiences walked out on an irish comedian in melbourne after he made joke after joke about child rape . there are topics that not funny to anyone not mentally insane . topic off the top of my head that ’s never funny - raping an infant . but if you mentally insane you can joke about anything . i would argue that there are some things which are so awful and horrible that there can never be a right context for them to be joked about . any jokes about her are not funny and never will be . you can make a joke about something , but it does n't mean that you should , because some stuff just straight up is n't funny . tell a joke about child rape in a room full of people and see how many laughs you get . say you make a joke about miscarriage to the big bruiser at your boxing gym ; you think he 'll be a receptive audience but he could just as well know someone , like his wife , that recently had a miscarriage . i would suggest that when you take the chance to make a risque joke , do n't be surprised if you get backlash by it . just accept that it was wrong , apologize if appropriate , and move on . i had a comedian friend tell me once that you can joke about anything , as long as you 're not joking about victims . not funny at all , because you 're essentially making light of someone 's suffering that they likely do n't take lightly at all . for example pete davidson ( snl ) used to tell a joke about how he did n't care when his mother told him his firefighter father died in 9/11 because he was seven and she got him a ps3 right after . i think that 's a funny concept , because he 's joking about his own tragedy . however , if you or i were to joke about his father passing , that would likely upset him because we 're trivializing someone else 's suffering to get laughs about a situation that we did n't experience the pain of firsthand . i think most people are as long as the joke is actually funny and is n't just ' funny ' because it 's offensive and dark , which is basically like the edge equivalence of a penis joke . the problem however is when people who are unironically racist , prejudice , etc join into this community of offensive humor and thinks that they are welcomed . so now when you use offensive humor , anyone who does n't know you well will likely associate you with a crowd of people who genuinely take their racism and prejudice seriously . i would say that asking people how they feel about it is a helpful strategy , but it also creates a predicament for them . they may feel a pressure to go along to get along with a friend or in a social group even though they are being hurt or they do n't know how they feel about it fully . it makes me feel like no matter how nice or welcoming i 've personally been to them , that there 's still an attitude there that encompasses me . and those particular guys make comments and jokes that they did n't ask permission to make , but even if they did , it would have really put me on the spot ( go along or be the "" word police "" ) instead of the guy doing it . i ca n't say i 've done it perfectly throughout my life - the unfortunate thing about speaking off the cuff is sometimes you do n't think about something until you ca n't take it back , but i 've been fortunate to have people give me grace to expand and add nuance to my understanding about it . as far as the people go that "" get offended on the behalf of others with no personal ties , "" i was having a lot of issues with a co-worker seemingly getting offended by everything because i ’m not very polished even when i follow my rule . i wanted to understand her rather than writing her off as a person , not just because we have to work together , but also because i value compassion . i realized that she vehemently strives not to ever put people on the spot like i described early , and not to laugh at it which encourages it . if she speaks up , no one else is made to be on the spot as the minority within a group . she feels a moral obligation not to ignore the situation just because she has the ability to , just like if one of my guy friends were to speak up about the red pill-esque comments . the problem is that many people do n’t pick up on social cues for the right context . for example : i was working on a group project about study outcomes and one person in the group makes some jokes about guns and murder out of nowhere . absolutely not the right context , but apparently this person does this all the time in other projects . he probably thinks he ’s being funny but the jokes have no place there . so for your argument to work , more people would have to heighten their understanding of context and social cues . unfortunately , there are a lot of inept people out there who do n’t understand humor or context and think awful jokes are okay to say everywhere . if there 's a considerable risk that a joke may offend someone even if according to you the context is right , then it 's too risky a joke to make . if someone who legitimately thinks the holocause was exaggerated wants to ... there probably is n't a context that 's going to make that ok ? your identity as the teller of the joke is the framing device the joke is conveyed in and therefore creates some of that context . a guy who has a history of sexually harassing women making a joke about some woman overreacting to an innocent comment takes on a sinister and inappropriate tone even if the woman in question is 100 % overreacting to something 100 % innocent and basically anyone else making that joke would be fine . generally , victims of something and ingroup members can almost always make jokes about that thing/group . minorities can make darkly comedic jokes about the way cops treat minorities . lgbt people can make jokes about how lgbt people are . but also , the important thing is that when you tell a risky joke , you are accepting the possibility of it going badly . if you know some people are going to be offended by the topic , but choose to push through , you do n't get to say "" it was just a joke ! "" if you are with close friends and you know for sure they dont have issues with whatever you are joking about , fine , do it , but just try to remember that people dont share everything that happens to them . i think anything can and should be joked about in any context . how many degrees of separation between you and the person who "" actually has personal ties to the topic "" before you 're not allowed to be offended ? you say that you 'll change your view if someone convinces you that some things are never ok to joke about , but your premises are too poorly defined for anyone to do that since your definition leaves you open to put the goalposts wherever you want them to be . how about this - tell your jokes and if people are more interested in talking about how offensive they are instead of how funny they are , work on telling a more funny joke . nonetheless if you feel like cracking a joke to your colleague after they have left , go for it . i think i can say that basically any person who works in a place where there is a lot of death they have atleast joked once about one of the people who died , just to make it a bit easier for themselves . there 's a fundamental difference between "" anything can and should be joked about "" vs "" anyone can make jokes about anything with anyone at any time "" . as long as it ’s funny it ’s ok , people can laugh even at their own expense . comedians , good comedians can improvise and read the room . they can warm up an audience and feel them out , people without a sense of humor or without the necessary intelligence to get the joke , or if there is a language barrier , well , that fails our first rule , it needs to be funny . telling a joke about the prophet muhammad to a room of fundamental muslims would work if you were part of the group , and even if you were not and they killed you , would be funny to me later on , but to you would not be humorous . if you were telling a bunch of sex jokes to minors , again would be funny to a neutral third party , but i doubt they would get it and would not be funny to them , so would fail the first rule . "" it 's ok when it 's ok "" kind of deal . having said that , i believe some jokes can inspire violence or contribute to real life oppression and are never ok , imo . let 's say some tells an "" offensive "" joke in a "" locker-room "" kind of scenario . everyone enjoys the joke , and laughs , no one is offended . however , in this case , the joke contributes to someone 's worldview , giving them a feeling of acceptance , or even expectation placed upon them to change how they act in real life . if the joke was , say , a rape joke , implying that raping a woman is no big deal , then someone who already carried this worldview may feel that their actions are acceptable , legitimised somehow , or even expected . but then this brings us back to the original post , the context here is "" telling the joke to people who will believe it legitimizes their already violent views "" , e.i. the wrong context ... this is just my opinion on how a scenario can play out ( i 'm not suggesting this is always happening ) . in my personal experience , the boys who make sexist jokes are also the ones who touched girls inappropriately and/or sexually harassed us at school . i will never be friends with anyone who does n't believe that you can make a joke about anything the okayness of a joke is often related to who is making that joke . a holocaust survivor is allowed to make a holocaust joke ( because that joke will more likely contain the nuance of experience ) too many "" it 's okay to joke about things "" arguments take out the speaker as if jokes exist in a vacuum and "" pc culture "" wants it destroyed in a vacuum as opposed to certain people can make certain jokes because they have certain experiences/outlooks that inform the joke . i think that sometimes jokes can boil down to a truth that the teller holds , whether they are aware of it or not . so in this case , making light of serious situations can predispose a person 's actual beliefs , regardless of intent . if this was True to all topics then you would expect the people who have been through these terrible events to be the ones making the jokes . generally when people say do n't joke about a topic , they are assuming the joke is promoting the worng act . you may be able to argue there is an appropriate time to make them , but i can not see why we have a moral obligation to make said jokes like your post claims . a joke about the immediate suffering of someone that is present is something one shoukd not joke about . now i ’m okay with making any jokes as long as they do n’t build an extremely negative stereotype type of people groups , because some people may take those jokes as fact and begin to believe them and hate on those people . that does n't mean that it wo n't offend or be distasteful , but it 's up to the person making the joke to decide whether they are willing to deal with the consequences of what they say . if you 're too offensive , you 'll lose friends or might be disciplined if it 's said at work , but it 's still up to the jokester to decide if it 's worth it . if there is an entity outside of each individual that can decide what is allowed and what is n't , free speech started to get limited . bring outside the normal comfort zone of speech is what makes a joke funny . i wish that instead of saying “ you should n’t make jokes about i recommend watching some stewart lee if you can . in his comedy vehicle he does an episode on the context of offensive words , as well as the proper setup of an offensive joke which would go a long way towards clarifying your view . if you are being secretly recorded , would you still make the joke , because it might be taken out of context later ? since a lot of people are stupid , and will make inappropriate jokes at the wrong time in front of the wrong audience , it 's better ( in a social contract sort of way ) to just blanket say , do n't joke about these topics , because a certain percent of the population lacks the necessary tact and prudence to make these types of jokes successfully . if you do n't mean to hit someone with your car , but you do anyway and they die , you will still go to jail and they will still be dead regardless of the "" context "" and "" intent "" no matter how often you move the goal posts and no matter how much mental gymnastics you try to do to get out of it no one has to forgive you , talk to you , laugh at your jokes , put up with you or be your friend , romantic partner , or employer . regardless of whether a holocaust victim or a jewish person is present , you can tell a funny holocaust joke that uses the unique situational stuff of the holocaust . for example , you could tell a deeply racist and offensive joke and pass it off as a "" joke "" but also look around to see who is laughing the most . those are the closet racists or supremacists and you then make a beeline for them and form deeper bonds with them and form your racist clique . a lot of people use humor as a code to get insights into the True nature of people . they also use humor as a veil , an excuse , to do offensive things . but many many other times , humor is just a thinly veiled excuse to just exhibit boorish behavior and then laugh it off when others object . now i 'm not going to lie , i have personally laughed at a rape joke once or twice in the past , i completely understand how upsetting it can be for some people . the person telling the joke was a close friend who i know is a generally nice , funny guy that tells all kinds of jokes from knock , knocks to dark humour and he would n't have meant any real ill intentions with the joke and the joke itself was more comedic than an attempt to say something awful.but saying that , if a random guy came up to me in the street and yelled out a rape is fun joke and walked off cackling . the example you chose was a victory in the end , so i get how it could help us process the tragedy and remind us that we won . i think any subject can be appropriate for a joke , but i do think there are things and particularly people which are never appropriate to make an object of mockery . so if you tell a rape joke that really hurts them , they have to choose between pretending they 're okay , outing themselves as a victim in order for you to view their offense as legitimate , or objecting without outing themselves and being dismissed by you as one of those illegitimately offended parties . it 's that people should generally stay away from sensitive topics for jokes , because the joke is likely to fail , and the the stakes for potentially offending someone is higher with sensitive topics . an aside : professional comedians generally get away with make jokes about sensitive topics more than the average person , because of the when and the how . furthermore , when people pay to go to a comedy show , they are an captive audience and are more likely to find the jokes funny in that environment ( the correct context ) . do you think that there 's somebody other than the target of the joke who can determine the right context ? i know people who 've uttered that phrase who then joke or laugh at comedy about that subject . but the difficult part is defining what makes something a joke . however , i do n't think it 's a big enough deal to justify going around policing jokes , which probably just makes these problems even worse . this might not change your view , but i would say suicide should never be joked about . lots of people who ' joke ' about suicide are actually suicidal , and they may say that they use joking to cope , but in reality it normalizes the act in the persons mind and makes them more likely to make an attempt on their life . maybe i just do n't have a sense of humor , but there is no gain to be had from joking about topics like this , only cons . let 's say you 're at a party or some small gathering and you decide to tell an offensive joke . do you know everything about everyone that is present and you know for a fact that no one has a personal connection to the serious topic you are about to joke about ? i do n't know how your ideas can be applied in reality when someone is actually telling a joke who is not a comedian doing stand-up or something . there is no error-free way of confirming that none of your current audience does n't have a personal connection to the topic . i guess i am not saying that joking about touchy subjects should n't happen . i think it 's fine if it happens in the context of comedy shows and other "" professional "" settings because people going to such shows should expect humor that is going to be deemed as controversial or "" offensive "" to some degree . i would personally avoid controversial topic jokes but that 's just me . anything can be joked about only if the joke is funny ."
9ykc3q,"anyone can be racist , but most people either believe that they arent racist or they are not willing to admit to being racist in public . i believe that most people will strongly avoid being outed as someone with racist beliefs even if they actually do hold racist beliefs . rarely do you have someone in good faith admit that they hold racist beliefs of others . it is more common to for someone to admit that they have racist grandparents , parents , family members , childhood friends , before admitting their personal racist beliefs . this is most likely due to the negative stigma of being labeled racist . denial instead of self reflection is the default for accusations of racism . it is common for racism to flow freely in anonymous setting and racially homogeneous settings but racism in public happens mostly through coded language , and dog whistles , irony , and humor . there are people who are n't racist , do n't consider themselves racist , and those who deny it , but very few who actually admit it .","if it were just the social stigma , people would still be willing to internally admit they are racist . i believe the people you are talking about really believe they are not racists in their own head much of the time . people who are n't forced to think about race relations have the privilege of thinking they are n't racist without ever really thinking about what racism is exactly . however , i came to hold beliefs that most would call "" racist "" through self-reflection . if you ca n't support your beliefs with hard evidence , then perhaps you are the one in need of self-reflection . not long ago , one of the members of the proud boys was labelled racist , when in reality he was a loving husband and father to his black wife and kids . obviously this person would immediately refuse the idea of "" self reflection about his racism "" so he denies the claim by stating the truth . however for unclear reasons , black people ( and other minorities ) avoid dealing with self declared racists . i think it ’s important to be careful with the concept of dog whistles , as it often makes people more confident in calling others racist than they ought to be . people seem to draw the conclusion that anything that can be interpreted as a dog whistle necessarily is intended to be one and therefore that the “ whistler ” is racist . if you define it as thinking one race is inferior because of their race , i think there are very few people who fall under that category . i just saw an interview with michelle obama where she said she did n't feel part of the black community when she was a kid because she valued things like education and got made fun of for it by other black kids . if you consider that to be racism , then i would say most people are racist and do n't admit it . but the reason they do n't admit it is because they are probably defining racism in their heads as believing another race is inferior and they do n't . it 's also worth pointing out that people stereotype based on almost everything , though . it does n't make sense to admit you have racist thoughts because the social cost is worse than any possible good it can generate . i have always seen racism as a natural part of humans because humans make snap judgments all the time . the first dimension is having opinions based on the skin color and the second dimension is allowing that thought to factor into their decision-making process . think of a possible racist who will gladly hire a young black man because he is wearing a suit and speaks well . he can set aside his racist views because he values other things more . both will deny being racist because neither will see themselves on the extreme scale . it does n't do anyone good on admitting having thoughts of racism ."
9yjpi4,"wwiii is inevitable , and will likely happen soon , barring a worldwide natural disaster i have 2 primary reasons for believing that we are doomed for another cataclysmic war . 1 ) critical states . critical states are where a system is in an unstable equilibrium such that a small nudge could cause an unpredictable , cascading re-stabilization . for example , the reason that forest fires are ravaging much of the west coast of the u.s. is because we have mismanaged forests for a century , causing an unstable buildup of undergrowth pushing forests into a critical state where the smallest spark can cause devastating fires . humanity is similarly in a critical state , propelled by the population explosion caused by industrialization . global capitalism under u.s. hegemony has , in some ways , united much of the world for about a century now causing there to not be any major conflicts like the world wars of the early 20th century , but capitalism is inherently broken and wealth does n't "" trickle down "" meaningfully enough to stymie the tide of brutish nationalism that we see now sweeping the world and the "" forest management "" policy of 75 years is reaching its breaking point . which brings me to point # 2 : fascism defines itself through making enemies of others . 2 ) in the absence of a global leftist movement to re-balance the distribution of resources in a way that makes people 's lives meaningfully better , many turn to fascism and nationalism . these ideologies are simple , and those who subscribe to them are simple to control . they are stable vortices , at least domestically , swirling around a central figurehead pulled down by the gravity of fear , hatred , and blame . these movements use enough of the language of leftism to sound like they will have a positive impact ( anti-elitism ) but rather than definite the elite as those with actual power and money , fascists redirect that fear and hatred against the weakest demographics in a region , and define those weaker demographics as the "" other "" . the "" other "" is a necessary part of fascist ideology and pushes fascist countries inevitably toward conflict with one another . so my conclusion is this : capitalism has failed , causing poverty , which in turn causes resentment . right-wing authoritarian leaders across the world have begun to channel this resentment in the wrong direction , i.e. downward against those already marginalized instead of upward against those who could redistribute wealth and nip this violent resentment in the bud . socialism is seen by most as a failed ideology , and is too idealistic to work in reality ( i do n't personally believe this but that has been the party line since the end of wwii ) and so barring some cataclysmic natural disaster that hurts enough people enough that they no longer care about the demonized "" other "" , that hatred will be turned outward against other nations as more right-wing demagogues consolidate power domestically .","what separates a world war from iraq , afghanistan , syria , where there is definitely a war and armies from multiple countries around the world are participating ? first of call , capitalism has n't failed , because of capitalism in the uk i can become pretty much anything i want with enough hard work , the rich got rich through hard work , why should a business owner who risked everything and has worked incredibly hard get anywhere near the same as a cashier who is only there for as little as possible with no care or determination ? extremism is on the rise because the left wants everyone ans everything censored if it offends them , lack of freedom of speech is why people turn to the alt-right . with nukes war becomes a huge risk , because if one goes off then you 're dead , this risk combined with countries thinking much more more morally means that actually starting the war is dangerous as you 'll either be nuked or be ganged up on by multiple other countries ."
9yi8gz,"employers should be allowed to discriminate against pregnant women why ? because that will impact how they perform in their job . particularly when they give birth and have to leave work for months or even a year , though their limited physical abilities might also matter . and in some places maternity leave is even paid , which puts more burden on the employer to not only temporarily replace her but pay for both her and her replacement . that 's a big impact that they are n't even allowed to consider . why is this different from discrimination based on race , sexuality , disability , or gender ? those things should not impact how well a person can do their job , unlike pregnancy . if for whatever reason it does , you can show that and not hire them ( like a woman not being able to pass a physical test ) . disabled people need more protection because it 's a lifelong state that they did not choose , unlike pregnancy which is a choice and temporary . i can also refuse to hire someone that is disabled if they can not perform the job too , so it 's not a blanket protection . so pretty much it sucks for the employer and the pregnant woman does n't deserve the protection . cmv .","it is detrimental to society to disadvantage the people who have children , because you are by definition disadvantaging children . you are basically choosing to prioritize short term interests ( employers right now ) over long term interests ( investing in all children of our society ) . you 'd basically be shooting yourself in the foot if you encouraged society to disadvantage parents and make raising their kids more difficult . not to mention , children are innocent and do n't have a choice to be born . they are the ones ultimately being punished when it comes to anti-parent work policy . businesses do n't exist in a vacuum . they exist in and benefit from a thriving or at least stable society . females are currently the ones capable of carrying a fetus to term . if they are allowed to be discriminated against for being pregnant , then we are effectively creating a society where roughly half the population exists as second-class citizens . women could not have careers because they would be discriminated against not simply because they are pregnant but that they could become pregnant ... even if they would personally choose not to have a child . a better and more equitable solution would be to change maternity to leave to paternity leave . there 's no reason to believe the father could not do the same . this would certainly give new parents and their employers more flexibility in the months following pregnancy . two things to keep in mind : ( 1 ) paid maternity leave is 100 % required for society to work , and ( 2 ) we ca n't let the perfect be the enemy of the good . ( 1 ) there are a couple of facts we need to stipulate at the outset : ( a ) every woman has the right to pursue her own career goals , just like men , and ( b ) only women can bear children . because bearing children entails , at best , significant physical hardship , bearing children is likely to interfere with a woman 's pursuit of her career goals . so , we can fix the problem by making it illegal for employers to impede women 's careers based on pregnancy . we need to encourage women to have children , because birth rates are falling all across the wealthy world . an important factor in those falling birth rates is the False choice between a career and motherhood . however , just because there is a better version of the policy available does n't mean that the current policy is worse than no policy at all . in fact , the current policy is better than no policy at all , for the reasons listed in ( 1 ) . you choose to value this individual ( ill use the feminine , as your argument is about pregnant women ) only on her ability to work rather than value her as a person . people are meant to do more than work and die . in conjuncture with this logic of placing the value of people over the value of business , i dont much care about the cost of having a pregnant woman on staff . if we still set the system in which a business must operate based on what is cheapest for the business , we would still be making pennies an hour . so if society has changing values , a business must adapt its model or make way for a business that can operate under the new conditions . i ’m not sure if this is going to change your view , since you seem to hold a radically different set of priorities than i do . however , since you seem to genuinely not understand a perspective that would want maternity leave as a requirement , let me offer you mine . first , it ’s important to note upfront that no one has a right to own a business with employees ; it is a privilege granted by the state . there are also all kinds of restrictions on what types of business you can run and where you can run them . there are also all kinds of restrictions on how you can treat your employees . i mention that because it ’s important to note that placing requirements on what a business can or ca n’t do is the norm . with that in mind , my attitude toward business ownership is that if you are employing people full time , you have a responsibility that they can maintain a livelihood under your employ . it also means that you are restricted in how many hours you can require that they work . they get to have time off to do other things , regardless of how “ fair ” you as the business owner may feel that is . if you have one employee willing to work 70 hours a week and the other only wants to work 40 hours a week , you ca n’t fire the latter employee simply because they wo n’t work more hours , regardless of the fact that this means you have to employ two people instead of just one . if someone is willing to work for you for only $ 2 an hour , you ca n’t fire your employees demanding minimum wage just because they are choosing to demand more than $ 2 an hour . because , as an employer , you have a responsibility to your employees . i think if you want the privilege of owning a business , then you should be required to pay your employees maternity/paternity leave . like i say , i recognize you seem to have a different set of priorities and so you draw the line in a different place . maybe you also see minimum wage or a 40 hour work week or anti-child labor laws as unfair on business . that ’s fine , and like i say , i ’m not sure if this is actually going to change your view . but placing these kind of requirements on business is not outside the norm , because it is not a right to own a business . so basically you think a businesses ability to earn as much money as possible is more important than the welfare of the people in the society that it operates ? you can see what 's happening in countries where not enough kids are being born and not enough immigrants are bolstering the economy . people often conflate pregnancy with something voluntary , meaning "" not forced by the government to do in some capacity "" . that 's fine , but neither is holding a steady job . paying a tiny bit for maternity leave is n't at a loss for the company entirely as it bolsters the economy they function in - and everywhere has pregnant women . it 's not like some jobs only have pregnant people flocking to it . the problem that "" being pregnant "" just becomes a proxy for discrimination by gender . women would either lose their jobs or wo n't be able to find a proper new job for up to 9 months until their child is born and they 're out of medical care . the fact that allowing such discrimination will only ever disadvantage women in this way ( and never men ) means that it 's inherently a form of gender discrimination . reinstating a right to discriminate against pregnant women would have the effect of punishing some percentage of women for becoming pregnant . if anything , the majority of western countries that have paid maternity leave pay for it out of social security . im not challenging we need to protect those whom work from employers who want to use “ pregnancy ” as a crutch to further oppress their workers . if a man comes in to an interview and mentions that he really needs this job because he just found out his wife is pregnant , do you not hire him because of it ?

9yheet,"turning abortion into a feminist issue is off topic , and arguing that it 's the woman 's choice will never convince a pro-life activist first of all , i will say that i am 100 % for the legalisation of abortions , and i believe that it should be available for free to all women , regardless if the pregnancy is a result of rape or not , regardless of the situation of the woman . & #x200b ; however , when i find discussions about the subject from people that are "" pro "" abortion , they often consider it as a feminist problem , letting the woman do what she wants with her body , wich is why they are calling themselves pro "" choice "" . & #x200b ; but when i see discussions from pro "" life "" activists , the arguments are sometimes coated in religion , like "" god created all lives , they are all sacred "" , but they always derivate from the same point of view : they believe that having an abortion is killing a baby . wich might explain why most of them are so passionate about this . hell , if they thought we were killing babies and did n't care , that would be even worse . but in my life , i 've never , ever , seen someone suggests that a woman should let the man decide ( at least not in my country , france , i 'm not counting other places like saudi arabia ) & #x200b ; now , i personnaly do n't consider a foetus as a living entity , just a cluster of cells . deciding at wich point it become alive is a tricky debate , even though the consensus say it 's when the brain starts developing . & #x200b ; but when i see pro "" life "" arguing with pro "" choice "" , when the firts ones express their concerns about killing children , the second ones either dismiss their argument as religious nonsense , or they give their argument that it 's a health issue for the woman , that 's it 's her body , and therefore her choice . wich not only does n't answer their concerns at all , but also attacks them , by either insulting their beliefs , or suggesting they might be sexist . & #x200b ; i simply can not conceive how this argument will ever convince a pro life . sorry if i rambled a lot , i still have troubles structuring my ideas .","addressing the "" concerns "" is likely impossible in the framework of your own . on the other side , "" addressing "" or "" respecting "" one 's concern is generally understood as "" agreeing with them "" meaning it 's basically impossible to respect one side without actually being on it . for instance , it does n't really matter to me whether fetuses are people , i still think the woman gets to decide whether or not she carries a pregnancy to term . her ownership of herself should be absolute . this means that in the vast majority of discussions i 'll have with pro-life people , it will either appear like i dismiss their arguments outright or want to murder children , because if i cared i 'd be pro-life too . it 's therefore impossible to adress concerns pro-lifers care about . because those concepts almost by definition not exist , or are irrelevant in the pro-choice framework . things like religion / sanctity of life / whether fetus is a life , etc. . are irrelevant concepts if the main pro-choice framework is "" it 's her body , her choice "" . we could say that pro-lifers are arguing past a pro-choicer 's arguments as well , and that pro-lifers are unlikely to convince a pro-choicer to become pro-life by arguing that abortion is murder when a pro-choicer already holds it be self-evident that abortion is not murder , and that abortions are strictly an issue of bodily autonomy . it seems to be the case here that pro-choice is definitely a feminist issue ( allowing abortion obviously affects women more than it affects men ) , but it 's just an issue which is so controversial that it has lots of different aspects to consider , some of which pro-choicers value more than pro-lifers and vice-versa . i admit that in an argument or a discussion it might be worth it to argue according to your opponent 's concerns , but it 's not a realistic expectation that people should make their own personal decisions on what they think about a topic in the terms of the people who disagree with them . in a discussion you 're looking to change somebody 's mind , but in how you personally view a topic you have no reason to make your decision on somebody else 's terms . then ask , "" what if the kid grows up in a bad situation because their mom could n't get an abortion and as an act of desperation , the kid decides to rob you or murders you ? or would you offer hilters mom an abortion knowing that it might 've stopped the jewish genocide . "" whether it should be a woman 's choice is not strictly a feminist issue . no one gets an irrevocable right to use and/or feed off someone else 's body against their will , whether it 's a fetus in a woman 's body , or some other situation . going through pregnancy and birth creates higher levels of health risks ( and even death ) for women than having an early abortion . i believe that these people would be more likely to become convinced by rational arguments . after all , nothing will convince someone who thinks that "" god created all life , a baby got a soul from conception "" that abortion is not killing . the goal is to convince the people writing the laws and the people who are not religious that women should be able to do whatever they want of their body so that laws permits them to abort as they want . turning abortion into a feminist issue is off topic . arguing it 's a woman 's choice wo n't convince pro-lifers if i believe that abortion is a feminist issue because it 's an issue that predominantly affects women 's ability to control their bodies and laws specifically effecting women , and i believe that the main reason to be pro-choice is about female bodily autonomy then whether or not pro-life people agree with me or not does n't matter . i 'm pro-life , and i can tell you that one of the best arguments for the pro-choice side is judy jarvis thompson 's famous violinist argument . she argued that even if the unborn are full human beings , abortion is still a woman 's right since she has the right to decide who can use her body . in her analogy , you are supposed to imagine waking up and discovering that you are attached to a famous violinist who must use your body to stay alive for the next nine months . she says that even though it may be charitable for you to allow this , you have no obligation to allow it and that you have the right to say no , even if that means the violinist will die . a lot of people have been persuaded by this argument , which shows that some pro-life people can be persuaded by arguments from bodily autonomy . besides that , here 's a blog post by a pro-choice woman who fully agrees that the unborn are living human beings but who nevertheless thinks abortion is a woman 's right . she used to be pro-life , but she apparently changed her mind because of arguments for bodily autonomy . being pro choice , there is reason to feel that keeping a life is a good thing . there is reason to agree that a couple of cells that are likely to grow into a full person matters . for me though , my fondness of life increases with how self aware and intelligent that life is . to know that a living thing had thought and feelings and a mind ... a single cell matters , but little compared to a fully grown human trying to keep their life in order . if people do n't understand what the benefits/moral arguments are , than abortion to them is at best a neutral action and at worst murder , therefore no harm done and possibly lots of gain in outlawing it . every single time i 've debated with a pro life person , they generally start off arguing from a position of "" abortion is murder . "" invariably , without fail , at some point in the argument they will say something to the effect of : "" if a woman did n't want to have a baby she should n't have had sex . "" behind every pro-life position , whether or not it 's ostensibly based in some argument about the sanctity of human life , there is an undergirding view to the effect that women should not be free to make their own sexual choices and a general distrust of female sexuality ."
9yfa4g,"alcohol prohibition is good . public health is a constant anxiety of society , some societies have gone to some extreme measures to ensure certain level of public health and safety , prohibitions are very common , and mostly succesful , however , alcohol has for most of history , been an "" untouchable "" issue , regardless of how bad it is for society . according to who , 1 in 20 deaths worlwide are related to alcohol , that is absolutely insane , in the us alone around 10,000 people die from drunk driving , around the same rate of gun violence that doesnt include suicide , and acording to who , worldwide alcohol threatens the safety of people x10 the amount of any type of violence , including gun violence . the dangers as stated by who are not only about driving or accidents , but health , in the us prohibition era , deaths related to the health impacts of alcohol were significantly reduced , prohibition was actually considered a success , however the addiction to alcohol is so prevalent in western society that they had to give in to this dangerous hedonism . we also have comparable evidence from the ussr , where health complications caused by alcohol where significantly reduced along with crime , violence , and work absence","as to the harm to innocent bystanders ( like in the case of drink driving ) we should have tough laws to discourage this behavior as that takes it from an issue of personal choice and acceptance of the consequences to one of willful harm to others . it does n't make sense to ban activities that are generally not an issue for socioty ( socioty largely does not care exactly when individual members due ) in order to catch the edge cases . alcohol ban would lead to organized crime selling it illegally . look at what 's going on in mexico ( as well as the rest of latin america ) as a result of drug prohibition . you could make an impact on drinking rates with education and spending the tax money from alcohol on things that would help reduce the other problems . the only way to put it in practice would be to forego democratic decision making and use authoritarian measures to force the prohibition . to stop people from using that ethanol to drink , you must put adulterants in it to make it undrinkable . i buy a bottle of whiskey now , i know it is safe to drink . people will also start to drink more as they did during prohibition , because when you score some booze you 're going to drink it all up . alcohol consumption only went down overall because the casual drinkers stopped drinking , and those are n't the people who are going to have the health and social problems related to alcohol . you 've got to look at the upside of alcohol and the downsides of prohibition before you can say its good . ( 2 ) we value personal freedom and people 's ability to make their own decision about what they want and do n't want . it would fail to protect the most vulnerable people ( alcoholics ) from the dangers of alcohol . if you really want to help society , put a sin tax on alcohol and use that money on public funding for health programs to help alcoholics . your evidence only backs up the conclusion that not drinking alcohol is good , but not that a policy of prohibition of it would be good . for comparison , it sounds very similar to me when people claim that since sexual abstinence is known to prevent all pregnancies , it must therefore also be an efficient policy to provide an abstinence-only education program ."

9ydgf7,"eating animals , and , to a lesser extent , using animal products is cruel and wrong i have eaten meat my entire life , but in the past year i have come to the reluctant view that my choice to eat animals is cruel and wrong . i also believe that , to a lesser extent , my use of animal products is also cruel and wrong . this sucks because i unfortunately love eating meat . but equally unfortunately i also love animals . i have made a conscious effort over the past year to reduce how much meat i eat to a couple times a week , and have given up eating certain animals almost entirely , namely pigs and octopuses , on account of their high intelligence and even emotional awareness . when i do eat meat it is mostly fish or a few chickens or occasionally a cow or two . i always make sure not to eat factory farmed animals whenever possible however i still feel bad because animals are , like humans , conscious beings , who almost certainly suffer , and who very likely also experience emotions like anxiety panic and even terror . such emotions are likely to result from being killed to become my food , and so i still ca n't escape the conclusion that even though i have a less bad diet now than i had a year ago , my actions remain cruel and wrong . i 'm primarily very selfishly interested in arguments against my view that could justify my continued ( if less frequent ) meat eating , but i am also open to arguments against other aspects of my view , including that there is a moral gradient between total veganism and eating factory farmed meat every day , and that there is a moral difference between eating a pig and eating a shrimp , for example . thanks !","nobody really knows , but if no one would eat their meat , they would n't live at all . so if every human stops eating meat tommorow , would n't it be cruel to deny all those animals to life at all ? imagine a world where animals lived happy lives on a farm . i feel like your guilt is less about the actual concept of eating meat and more of the cruelty that the modern food system often has . a lot of guilt i ’ve had is knowing the animals are mistreated not that i ’m eating them . i would argue that eating meat and animal products from ethical farms is the best moral decision : eating meat and animal products from time to time is the most healthy lifestyle when you dont have time for researching and mone to buy vegan or even vegetarian food ethical farms are making more money - more of them are created and , if buying meat from these farms becomes trendy - less unethical farms are being created basically - dont expect people to stop eating meat entirely right now . most people dont want to stop eating it and dont really care that much about the tortures or what not of animals . its better to spread the word of "" ethical farming "" by eating products from these farms rather than not eating animal products at all . maybe in future science will allow us to eat healthy and comfortably - then my moral standards will change . but for now by not eating animal products at all you are actually doing more harm than good , atleast in my opinion . the first animal did n't cause any suffering , but it is able to sustain itself by consuming another animal . there is a strong moral gradient which could allow you to continue eating meat while massively reducing the amount of suffering you contribute to . do n't eat chickens . they live under the worst conditions in factory farms , and do n't provide very much meat per capita . you could easily go through many chickens per year , however . with fish i 'm not quite so sure , as they provide even less meat per capita , but it 's not clear to me that fishing or aquaculture causes more suffering to fish than is already present in the wild . if you abstain from chickens , and eat say beef or pork instead , you can massively reduce the amount of suffering you cause in this way , without much harm to yourself . i needed to spend a few hours getting my thought organized . so ; the question on offer is whether or not it is acceptable , morally speaking , to eat meat or use other animal products . with that admission we must accept that many factory farms keep animals in conditions where they suffer greatly . my argument will not be addressing these items as i believe there is n’t much to say in their defense except that animal farming is convenient , which is not much of a defense at all . i do , however , think it is acceptable to eat meat and use animal products . if that were the case , it seems strange that the “ moral universe ” would produce a system of nature that relies entirely on killing and eating other living things if killings and eating other living things happened to be wrong . i apologize for inflicting all this upon you , but i think it ’s important for you to know where i ’m coming from when i say that , in my view , morality is a social contract between self-aware beings . what must be pointed out , however , is that this morality is , as far as we know , a human system . animals do not subscribe to the social contract of morality . you need look no further than prisons to find out . those who refuse to be bound by the social contract are not part of society . we do not “ owe ” them morality or cooperation in the same way we do those who follow the contract . now , obviously , i would rather prisoners receive counseling and rehabilitation so that they can follow the social contract , but what do we do with beings that can not , no matter how hard we try to help , abide by the social contract ? many would call such people animals , and it is perfectly acceptable to remove those being from society , and sometimes the world itself , if it benefits and protects people who do abide by the social contract . it is my opinion that we do not “ owe ” animals the automatic protection of life and liberty the same way we do other people . we should by no means visit such terror upon them , especially not merely for our convenience ( a major problem with the factory farming of animals ) , but i do not owe a cow the defense of its life . as the cow is not part of the social contract , neither does it owe me any protection of my life , of course . and so , to my mind , a cow may be killed if its death will support the lives of those in the social contract who , unlike the cow , know full well that their lives have an end and who may well live in terror of that happening . there is worth to considering whether some animals are self-aware enough , and civil enough , to warrant inclusion in the social contract of morality . naturally , some people also hold personal values that place the lives of animals higher on their priority list than mine . that said , when i remember the horrors of rape , murder , and torment that many animals routinely inflict upon even their own cousins without the possibility of regard for the lives of others , i do not feel so bad at all about a few mouthfuls of meat . millions of animals will die for you to be able to eat , regardless of your diet . is it more or less moral to make use of some of the animals that will die so you can eat ? i personally think it 's more moral , or at least neutral , to at least eat some of the animals that died so you could eat , instead of leaving them to rot . eating animals can not be wrong : we evolved to do it , are bodies need the nutrients they provide , and animal products are part of a natural symbiotic relationship . humans were created to eat plants and animals , from the beginning we were hunter-gatherers . we provide cows with life-long protection , and when they have lived for long enough to reach their maximum size and muscle , we eat them . if no keep eating meat , if yes you should probably stop . if your willing to accept the consequences of an animal being willing to eat you , you are permitted to eat animals . but yes , there are certainly plenty of simple justifications to eat meat , it just depends on where you place your morality . only eating non-cephalopod seafood is a step in the right direction . perhaps the way they 're killed might be cruel , but eating meat is not cruel . i would argue that the actual act of eating meat itself is amoral ; it may be morally virtuous to not eat meat ( i ’m not convinced of this ) but i have not heard a compelling argument for not eating meat being a moral obligation . any issues one has with factory/industrial farming/cruelty of animals is a separate issue from the act itself of eating meat . if you take the argument that animals do n’t “ want ” to be eaten , that they run from you when you go to kill them , well ... chickens run from most everything . an evolutionary impulse to avoid other animals/self preservation is not necessarily indicative of the animal “ wanting ” something in the sense of , say , a person not wanting to die . animals are not humans , and while there are plenty of good arguments against enacting cruelty against animals , those arguments are solidly based in the well being of the people around the cruelty , and the fact that cruelty to animals is indicative of cruelty to humans . i pull most of this from matt dillahunty ’s piece on veganism and the difference between moral virtues and moral obligations , arguments that i found persuasive . i think it is possible to believe that the slaughter of animals for food and byproducts is immoral and yet it is a moral action to use already slaughtered animals for food or other uses so they do not go to waste . if i refused to eat meat that will not be consumed by someone else , then those calories would need to come from somewhere else which would also have an impact on the environment . it is possible to eat meat without supporting the continuation of suffering of animals . i 'd like to argue a few specific cases towards using animal products , specifically , eggs , honey , and wool . all three of these things are things that the animals are going to produce , regardless of our intervention , and how much impact harvesting them has on the animals pretty much comes down to how ethical the farm is . now , of course , there are examples of bad practices regarding this - some beekeepers will overharvest honey and replace it with lower quality sugar syrup , some egg hens are kept in battery cages and kept immobile until they tear all their feathers out from boredom , and some sheep have skin painfully removed from their backsides to prevent maggots growing because it is easier than other solutions ( breeding out the susceptibility to flystrike , etc ) it is possible as a consumer , though , to research options and purchase these products from ethical farmers that treat their animals well . i live in the midwest , and there are many local farmers who sell their eggs out of their houses , so it is completely possible for me to only buy local eggs born from chickens that live in well cared for chicken coops . i also am a knitter ; my favorite yarn brand , by far , is a brand that sources most of their wool from farmers in uraguay who raise their sheep traditionally , on free range farms , that do not practice mulesing ( the practice of removing skin folds to prevent fly strike . ) many breeds of sheep no longer shed their fur naturally , so short of ceasing to breed these breeds entirely , they have to be shorn or they will eventually perish due to the sheer ridiculous length of their coats . in short , ethical farming practices can at least make one lean towards vegetarianism instead of pure veganism , since it is completely possible to source some items from farms that take very good care of their animals . its just usually a little pricier and requires a little more effort . admittedly , this does n't much address the ethical quandary of directly eating meat , but hopefully it offers a little insight into other animal-derived products . you get to choose between agriculture on a large enough scale to feed the population that results in displacement and exploitation of humans , or husbandry on a large enough scale to feed the population that is cruel to animals . so , from a certain point of view , if you refuse to eat enough protein and healthy fat through a vegetarian diet ( that you do n't manage meticulously to promote optimal brain health ) and you reproduce , you are betraying the species . we evolved to eat meat , but i still can agree with “ the animals have souls ” argument and such because you ca n’t disprove it , but to think not using animal products like eggs or milk is just dumb , that stuff is going to be there regardless of if you want it or not looking at some of your responses , it 's actually the killing of animals for their meat that you are objecting to . ( since clearly just the eating of meat ca n't be cruel to the meat - meat does n't have the capacity to feel suffering , being dead tissue ) most definitions require some sort of suffering , but that would allow for non-cruel killing of animals for meat , as long as they did n't suffer . most definitions of wrong references the moral system of humans , and that is a system that animals do n't participate in ."
9ydb0t,"the iraq war was neither illegal nor “ evil ” common opinion of many americans is that the iraq war was wrong and george bush is a war criminal for it . when you look at the recent events leading up to it i think the war was well within reason . saddam hussein first rose to power then began fighting the iranians and that was ok because they were our enemies . then he proceeds to genocide an ethnic minority in his own country ( killing 182,000 kurds during one campaign , utilizing weapons of mass destruction ) . after this he starts a war with a sovereign nation and occupies it . not comparing him to hitler but he was very similar with his atrocities/military invasions . if the world is serious about never again and not allowing genocides , would n’t it be moral to remove the regime responsible for such atrocities who continued active genocide up to 2003 . not to mention iraq was being run as a fascist state that regularly kidnapped , tortured and massacres any dissenters/supposed dissenters . the military invasion of iraq may have been started on False pretenses ( wmd ’s ) but it did remove a regime that is an arab version of the 3rd reich ( like seriously you have a military dictatorship , genocide , police state , one party rule , regular massacres , propaganda centered around a charismatic strongman , invasions of neighboring states ) the us was then forced to be the reigning government and occupying force . there were baathist members joining insurgent groups , old sectarian feuds exploding because the baathist rule was now gone and there was that unfortunate bombing of that important mosque . we removed a genocidal dictatorship and then were forced to keep a dysfunctional country under control . it was unfortunate a large scale insurgency happened and many died as a result but were not entirely responsible for that forming , we just had to fight it . we even eventually formed a democratic government who still ruled today . there are still issues but not at the same scale . tl ; dr the iraq war removed an arab 4th reich and unfortunately fought a large war . the handling might have been botched but it was noble and we really were toppling an evil government .","they overthrew our preferred dictator , so it 's justified if our other dictator buddy invades their country and uses chemical weapons on them ? there was nothing noble about the invasion of iraq and certainly nothing noble about the individuals who championed it . iraq posed absolutely no threat to the us and toppling suddam did n't benefit them or its people in any capacity . israel on the other hand not only saw a long held desire come to fruition when saddam was ousted , their wish came True without sacrificing israeli lives or resources . what is it that you think is noble about people at the highest level of government ( wolfowitz , perle , feith ) using us lives and resources to execute the foreign policy desires of israel ? irrespective of who 's dying where , the united states made a conscious and calculated decision to violate another country 's sovereignty . that concept had existed ( admittedly not inviolate ) since the signing of the westphalian peace in 1648 and remains the dominant conceptual framework under which countries work together . the central principle is that the ruler of a state ( later revised under wilsonian principles to the populace of a state ) gets to determine how that state is run -- not his neighbours , not his allies , not his enemies . if you want to show any respect towards the iraqi people , you have to start wit the premise that they are responsible for the state of their state , as it were -- that they have the government they want . the war had very little do with ousting a dictator . whether it ’s our business to do so is another question altogether . this country ’s moral compass is directly guided by money and power . one thing hussein did was keep all the religious tensions in his country suppressed . the sunnis and shias there want to kill each other , but they could n't when they were more afraid of hussein than they hated each other . hussein also was n't into the whole islamic terrorism thing , since any religious power sufficient to be a terror threat was just that -- a power -- and hussein could have no other power in his country but him . so no terrorists could operate in his country , contrary to the administration 's False claims . without him to suppress the terrorists , they 've absolutely flourished in that country . when we say that a war was ' illegal ' , what we mean is that it was in contravention of international law . the invasion of iraq broke a number of these international laws , most famously that the action was not agreed to by the united nations . in one sense , none of the actors in ww1 were acting out of any sense of pure malice or destruction , but in another sense , all war is kind of evil , and ww1 's utter pointlessness could make it an evil , by definitions of evil that do n't require a particularly culpable party . you will find with the iraq war that it is similarly morally complex . and yet , as you point out , many of the actors in the iraq war had very good intentions , and many of the outcomes , including the ousting of saddam hussein , might even be considered to be justice . in that sense , i do n't think there 's room for people to agree or disagree that the iraq war was ' evil ' . a more nuanced view would be to say that the iraq war was deeply destructive not just to iraq itself , but to global society , even though it did eliminate an evil regime . without it , there would be no global migrant crisis driving the rise of the alt-right and new fascist movements throughout the west . i think , at the very least , the iraq war was questionable , certainly in retrospect . the removal of all the established baathists from government was a terrible mistake . the violence died down when the us brokered power sharing agreements in 2007 ( the negotiations happened with the surge ) . the violence started back up again when the power sharing agreement was violated around 2011 ( around when the status of forces agreement renewal was being negotiated ) . but we didnt , and therefore it was illegal under the u.n.charter . but bush and co. lied and dragged us in in such a hurry , for no good reason , that we sent out soldiers there without the equipment they needed . parents of soldiers were fundraising to buy them body armor , for pete 's sake . if those were the True reasons there was no need for the extreme rush and to be so ill-prepared , not only in the invasion , but in not planning for what would happen after saddam was removed . "" evil "" and "" illegal "" are hard words to characterise a war because they are subjective terms . there is no clear way to decide if a war is illegal by any international standards , so the only question is was iraq by the standards of american laws . it was a war declared under False pretenses and once it turned into an insurgency style war there were many immoral acts committed by the us . it was a bad regime but that 's not acceptable grounds for an invasion . not to mention that the us military is not an effective tool at preventing genocides and ethnic/religious tensions in foreign nations . it made terrorism more common and more influential , it increased instability , it made iran more powerful , it showed some flaws in the us military , it was super expensive , it killed far more than hussein killed during peacetime . started for the main reason that the us felt that their superior military could shape the world and stop bad regime 's ."

"" hunting for sport and leaving the meat behind to rot is wasteful . "" this is n't actually a thing , and it makes sense if you think about it for a minute . meat is expensive , and one deer can ensure you 'll be eating venison steaks every day for months . it makes no fiscal sense to kill an animal and have its head/entire body stuffed ( which is a really costly endeavor ) and leave behind all the pricey meat . in fact , it 's illegal in most places to not hunt with the intent of your kill being eaten , even in africa . meat from trophy hunts in africa is usually donated to local villages , who need the food more than anybody . 3 .

"" aside from illegal poaching , this is again not really a thing . even in cases where threatened animals are hunted legally , not only is it heavily regulated and very expensive ( and therefore very beneficial to poor countries ) , it 's also restricted to older animals who have already passed on their genes and are irrelevant to the proliferation of the species hope this leads to a lively discussion !","however , a quick google search shows that is n’t the case . the most popular species hunted for trophy hunting are lions , elephants , rhinos , buffalo and leopards . unless we have some way to regulate all trophy hunting to ensure it does benefit the environment and eco system , i really can not support trophy hunting and i hope op you would come to some sort of agreement with me . this implies there are places where it is legal to hunt without the intention of your kill being eaten . that would fall under your description of legal trophy hunting and would still have the problem of wasted meat . i commented in another post about the ethical reasons against trophy hunting , but it 's also wrong because it 's kind of a stupid "" trophy . "" anyone can quickly learn to aim and shoot a rifle and how to track animals . hunting was impressive when you needed to run marathon length distances for days just to catch up to a wooly mammoth and stab it with a spear you spent hours fashioning yourself . today , humans can just use a high powered rifle ( that was built by someone else ) and carry the meat back on a car ( also built by someone else ) . the only danger a hunter actually experiences is from another human accidentally shooting them . the only thing you need to hunt bigger and more exotic game is more money and more time . i think killing any sentient creature is wrong unless you would profoundly suffer or die as a result of not doing so . i consider hunting ( and meat eating , for that matter ) ethical only in extreme cases , such as being stranded in the wilderness with no other food supply , needing to defend yourself against a dangerous animal on the attack , or living in a place where it is not feasible to obtain all nutrients necessary for human survival from non-animal sources . your title is about trophy hunting yet you constantly reference people posting about eating meat . trophy hunters are n't generally looking for their next meal when hunting wolves or lions . deer are one thing , but hunting other predators is where i draw the line personally . well , there 's ethics and i 'm having a hard time , no matter what framework i apply , with which i can ethically justify the killing of an animal just for fun ... i 'd argue that killing a cow for food because it tastes good instead of eating far healthier vegetarian meal is also wrong . you say there is nothing wrong with trophy hunting , and then you describe situations where trophy hunting is wrong and should remain banned . your high redefinition of "" trophy hunting "" seems arbitrary and will likely be the cause of a lot of your disagreement . some people do n't think you should kill animals at all and the three clarifying points here do nothing to address that core difference of opinion . if so , your reliance on comparison to food pictures on social media is not a good strategy to achieve that goal . people do n’t post food pictures out of pride , at least not commonly . to achieve your goal , i ’d start by striking that entire line of reasoning and focusing on why people are proud of trophy hunting and if that pride is justified . wild game hunting to most evokes a sense of danger and adventure . is it right for someone to pay a large sum of money , be guided in comfort to a spot where an aging specimen is unprotected , be handed a gun , pull a trigger and then go home with a trophy that someone else cut and cleaned ? as long as you eat what you kill , i think it is just fine ... however it is not typical in boar hunting for the meat to get used , or coyote hunting ... so i 'm not a fan , also cougar hunting . hunters love to say they are helping the ecosystem by slaughtering the animals lmao there ’s a difference between harvesting an animal for meat and killing an animal for fun/trophy and the meat not being wasted . so while th outcome of an animal ’s meat being used to feed humans is the same , i think you can still say it ’s wrong to have the motivation of killing an animal to kill an animal . i agree that , in theory , trophy hunting can be a good thing for culling older , non-breeding males to allow younger males to breed . however , there ’s a lot of evidence that the money and supposed “ benefits ” that are attributed to trophy hunting often find their way into the hands of the wealthy/elite through corruption . it also encourages illegal hunting by boosting the demand for things like ivory . an animal in the wild will produce revenue for its entire lifespan . the eco-tourism market dwarfs the trophy hunting market . these are the reasons i think trophy hunting is a net bad thing ."
9yasvu,""" gender is a social construct "" and "" people are born transgender "" are mutually exclusive statements . they can not both be True . if people are born transgender , then people are born with gender , so we can not say that gender is purely a social construct . if "" gender "" is defined as a set of proscribed social behaviors , then transgenderism is simply a preference for some social behaviors over others , which would make it a preference , not an innate identity . how can these be reconciled logically ? does n't the existence of transgenderism require us to acknowledge that gender is a quality that exists separately from society ?","gender is traditionally defined as the societal expectations that control the behavior of individuals based on their sex . trans gender people are individuals that defy the traditional definition of gender which relies on an individual 's sex . "" gender is a social construct "" is a saying that is used to break the notion that gender and sex are the same thing . it does n't imply that gender does n't exist , it simply challenges traditional societal expectations . "" people are born transgender "" because "" gender is a social construct "" however many other cultures , past and present , identify more than that - up to 6 that i am aware of . when a child is born in these cultures , gender assignment is tentatively assigned based on genitalia . as a child grows and their personality and preferences becomes apparent , then they are confirmed as one of those genders . the indian third gender hijra has been labeled as transgender , but it 's not an entirely accurate translation . now sex reassignment surgery is somewhat available with india 's supreme court recent ruling recognizing them officially as the third gender . it will be interesting to watch as surgery becomes more of an option in those cultures as to how many , and of which genders , choose to have their bodies altered to match their gender identities . both "" gender is a social construct "" and "" people are born transgender "" are convenient oversimplifications of complex topics used to explain them to people who have n't really thought about gender or transgender identities critically before . they are the newtonian physics of gender theory ; useful as a baseline , but it starts breaking down upon examination . "" gender is a social construct "" : while gendered roles have been seen in almost all human societies , the exact nature of gender roles differs , so absolutism over current gender roles does not make sense . many traditionally "" male "" things , ranging from what work men do to even whether pink or blue are "" male "" colors , have varied throughout different societies , and some societies even have more than two gender roles . so while there is clearly some factor that leads to gender roles existing in many different societies , most biologically essentialist arguments towards gender are obviously incorrect because they myopically assume the gender roles from the past 100 years or so of their society are the "" correct "" ones . so when having discussions that are society-wide in scale , it makes the most sense to point out these facts as a way to show how it 's ( generally ) not useful to argue in favor of strict gender norms , the same way it 'd ( generally ) not be very useful to argue for prescriptivist , unchanging definitions of words . "" people are born transgender "" : transgender people effectively can not change the fact they are trans , whether this is due to factors of biology innate at birth or due to how those biological factors interact with things like how they socialize with others and are treated in early childhood . trans identities can deal with gender roles , as discussed above . but they can also deal with the nature of their body itself , which is ( generally ) distinct from social gender roles , i.e. feeling more at peace with breasts or while on female hormones is not prima facie a societal gender role . this means that , on the scale of individual trans people , it makes the most sense to support them in their transition rather than argue for conversion therapy or suggest that some societal ill causes trans people to exist . what we discovered in these early 90s autopsies was that transpeople have brains that have the physical characteristics of their identified genders . in that sense , you are born as a transgender person . transpeople are aware on an instinctive level that there is a wrongness about the body signals their brains receive , and they will seek to assume a gender role to mitigate that sense of wrongness . we rely on someone 's gender identity to tell us if they are transpeople . even though the roles that they are taking are a social construct , in adopting it transpeople are able to mitigate at least some of the discomfort they experience . i 've never heard anyone say that . people say they 're born male or female and are raised as a boy or a girl . na we definitely are born with genders why do people think we are born transgender . the point is that "" gender "" means two many different things which is why i think this artificial distinction between "" sex "" and "" gender "" goes nowhere because there are way more things to distinguish and there 's nothing wrong with adjectives . people are born with a relation to all sorts of social constructs , not just gender . many germanic languages use the same word for ( physiological ) sex and gender , for example , which does n't mean that they are one and the same . gender identity is believed to be largely innate and immutable , based on the current state of research . gender expression is believed to be a mix of biological and social aspects ( example : body language has both biological elements resulting from body shape and social elements deriving from learned behavior ) . being transgender ( in the currently prevalent colloquial usage of the term ^ ( 1 ) ) means that you have a gender identity distinct from your physiological sex . it does not , per se , say anything about gender expression , gender roles or sexual orientation . while gender identity , expression , and roles are correlated ( simply as the result of social factors ) , they need not align and are in principle orthogonal . for an example of why we think that gender identity is largely innate and not something learned , see this study by reiner & gearhart . it followed 14 children , all of them natal boys , who had their sex surgically reassigned as newborns ( as part of a lifesaving surgery to deal with a horrific birth defect ) and had been raised as girls . ^ ( 1 ) which , confusingly , is distinct from the way it used to be used . the issue here is that "" gender is a social construct "" is a gross simplification . gender is an umbrella term that encompasses many ideas , and to make things further complicated , the word gender is often used to describe those specific ideas as well as the whole "" big picture "" . the former is a social construct , and the latter is heavily influenced by said social constructs . gender expression tells us how to act and how not to act , it tells us what we 're allowed to be good at and what we 're allowed to fail at because of our gender . gender identity is the experience of being a man , or a woman , or of not being either . whatever it is , it exists below the level of social construct , but the way it manifests to the world is shaped by those constructs . many women embrace feminine behaviours and presentation because they find it empowering and validating . others accept the gender roles but do n't care for them , simply because they do n't feel they 're worth fighting over . i get gender dysphoria , because your brain is telling you that you are the wrong sex . i am on board with gender dysphoria , but if you do n't have it , it feels like you just want embrace the stereotypes of each sex ?"
9y96f4,"police and ems should be given education grants for their service like how military receive the 9/11 gi bill for those not familiar with the 9/11 gi bill , it is an incentive for people to join the us military by paying for their education costs after service . it is a great way for people to avoid student debt loans and transition each member into a civilian career after their public service . reasons are the following : 1 ) give students more options to be able to fund their investment into their education besides going into debt , which currently is approaching $ 1.5 trillion total nationally . if you do not understand how much of a crisis this is : -- url -- 2 ) police and ems are doing a public service like the military ( for those that i expect will make the argument of how dangerous the military is : over 80 % of military jobs are non-combat ) . military/police/ems are all notoriously underpaid and these skills do not always translate into other careers , which is why gi bills were created for military in the first place . without going into debt , police and ems are trapped to a profession that expects an unpractical amount of altruism for 20 years and overtaxes them physically and mentally . 3 ) we need more people understanding what it 's like to be these professions , especially law enforcement . there is a wide misunderstanding of how difficult law enforcement really is . it 's exactly the people who go to college and are our future leaders who need this perspective . no one knows what they want to do for the rest of their life at 18 and this gives a 4-6 year contract for them to guarantee an education without debt and time to decide their career choice . 4 ) current efforts towards debt forgiveness programs are failing . the public service loan forgiveness program , the federal program that forgives student loan borrowers employed full-time in a federal , state or local public service job after 120 eligible on-time payments , has a 99 % dejection rate for those who applied and only covers federal student loans . if the idea is to trade public service for education , it should not be in the form of debt that requires forgiveness . do public service prior to your education . 5 ) this would increase diversity in these professions . 6 ) education is an investment . you go to college to give yourself more marketability . the amount of entitlement i see that people expect free college or free student loan forgiveness is insane . if you want your education paid for , doing it through public service is the best compromise . tl ; dr being able to enter a public service position , do a 4-6 year contract in exchange for full educational benefits , gain valuable insight into these misunderstood professions , avoid debt , gain an option besides staying stuck in a 20 year career that is underpaid with esoteric skills , and benefits all of society via actual incentives and not hand-outs gives students a great option for jump-starting their own careers and avoiding contributing to a larger national student loan debt .","also the military is treated differently because its a service most people serve outside the civilian borders and the us is very patriotic for the military service as you can tell by our defense budget spending compared to any other country . so the military can afford to give a gi bill after service has been paid . military members have to go months without seeing their families , and have to sleep in incredibly uncomfortable living quarters near other members of the military . you can easily quit from a police department or ems job at a moment 's notice . you can do it because your life circumstances change , a better job comes along , or you simply do n't like it anymore . police and ems are paid a wage set by supply and demand trends in the labor market . if there was a shortage of workers , they would be paid more to compensate . if more people wanted those jobs , they would be paid less . the same applies to the military . they are paid as much as it takes to hire enough workers . when fewer people want to join , they are paid more . here is a list of the most dangerous jobs in america , ems , fire fighters , they do n't even make the list , while police are down towards the middle . it does n't make much sense to give them the service for the danger or stress of thier jobs , and i suppose you could make arguements for thier importance to society , but then how do you weigh importance , like if all the loggers just stopped working , or all the truck drivers took off work , our economy and society would just instantly crash , like almost all jobs are vitally important to so many other interconnecting jobs and sectors , at this point if any of these jobs just stopped existing it would be as bad for our society as ems not existing i would think . military education benefits offset some of the compensation that would be otherwise offered as regular pay . my agency offers education stipends , you are limited to so many hours per semester , it does n’t have to be le related but you have to pass at 75 % in any class you sign up for . the problem we have had is , guys will get top tier training through us and then jump to another agency after a large amount of money has been spent of the their training for higher pay . this has brought up the idea of service contracts where you sign on for essentially a enlistment period , and if you bail at anytime for any related le job you are financially and civilly liable ."

9y8gjg,"bullying is necessary , if not required for a functional society . alright , so in a functional society , people need to be able to change and adapt to their ever-changing environment , and people have a tenancy to resist change . also in bullying , the whole concept is done to force a change onto either a person or an idea ( of any size ) . for instance someone might bully someone else because of their clothing or sexual orientation ( small things ) . or someone could bully a group of people because of their ideology or way of life ( religion , cultural customs ) ( large things ) . now , in light of this , sometimes people need to change , whether they believe so or not , because they might not know that what they are doing could be destructive towards them or their environment . for example : if some dude walks into your school or workplace wearing super tight pants , where you can see everything very clearly , by all means should he be bullied about it so that no one else is adversely affected by his decision . also : ( on a larger scale ) if a political leader denies climate change referendum , bullying should be required , but at that level the naming would change to ' protesting ' instead of bullying . now , i 'm not saying the way bullying takes place is a good thing or needed , for a lot of it escalates quickly to harassment and violence , i just think the concept of forcing change is needed . so , change my view .","if enough people do that , they might change their mind about it and stop doing it . if not , they ’ve already made up their mind and there ’s not a lot anybody can do or say to change that . often people focus on the person being bullied assuming that they ’re engaging in some behavior that should rightfully change . but what is the necessary aspect of feeling like you should change others , and why would it naturally take the form of bullying ? for example , if i stick gum in your hair while you 're not paying attention and you never find out i did it . from what i understand , you are implying that a functional society is dependent on change and that you view bullying as a primary way of bringing about such change . i do agree with you on the importance of being open to change however bullying is not necessarily the best way of bringing about change . people seek change here through conversation and not through bullying mainly because the primary goal of bullying is not really changing individuals but rather making them feel bad about whatever they are being bullied for . change is best brought about through open communication , understanding , respect and most importantly when an individual brings about the change themselves . all of this element of respect and understanding does not exist in the context of bullying . a functional society is not one where people continue to push others down for them to be on top ( that 's what happens with bullying ) instead a functional society is one where people motivate each other to strive for the best ( that what happens when you have a good education system and a supportive community where people feel safe when taking part in open conversation ) . exactly how does bullying have a positive effect on someone being bullied for their sexual orientation ( which is not a small thing ) ? with bullying , that decision lies entirely on the bully -- if he does not get what he wants , he bullies people until they comply . that is imo the worst kind of change , because there is no reason to assume the change a bully wants is a change anyone else wanted . if anything its the opposite -- if everyone else actually wanted the change , then it would happen without bullying . so by definition bullying is going against the desires of the many just to enforce the desire of the bully . how else could this bully enact change ? well , he could try to use logic and reason to convince someone to change their opinion on something . but doing that would require a logical reason to change their view , so this would be impossible if the change was illogical or unreasonable . bullying does n't need logic or reason though , you just find someone and bully them , even if what you 're bullying for is literally impossible to change , like picking on a short guy for being short . could you maybe unpack why you think being bullied for one 's sexual orientation is a "" small thing , "" and in what sense it would ever be a good thing if someone felt like they had to change their sexual orientation based on being bullied for it ? i 'm tempted to use bullying tactics to change your mind , but that would probably violate the rules . let 's grant , for the sake of argument , that for a society to be functional , people must be able to adapt and change . even so , bullying is not the only way to get people to change , so it is n't necessary or required for a functional society . it 's not even the best way to bring about change because it only results in a "" might makes right "" society . a better way to bring about change is through reasoning because through reasoning , the best ideas have the best chance of winning , rather than the ideas that happen to have the greatest number of bullies behind them . say you have a maths genius in school , and a jock that is n't a math genius . let 's assume that the universe is set up so that anyone that is good at math will end up surviving some catastrophic event in the future and anyone that does n't know math will not survive . so the jock bullies the math genius , so much so that the maths genius stops learning math and eventually does n't learn the one concept that would have saved him in the future . so in the end , both the genius and jock die . the maths genius bullies the jock so much so that the jock learns math and becomes a genius to stop the bullying . if so , i would say your argument depends on us knowing which situation will ultimately be beneficial for all involved . as a result , it becomes acceptable to bully all those that deny climate change . my problem is that we ca n't be certain what is ultimately "" beneficial "" for us . some people will argue that ethnic cleansing is beneficial for all involved , and by the bullying logic , it would be acceptable to bully those that do n't want to perform ethnic cleansing . so the bullying logic depends on us knowing what is "" correct "" at all times , and when it comes to what 's correct , some would argue that morality is n't objective . for things that are known to be objectively beneficial , then perhaps instead of bullying , there are other more effective ways to force a change . the main problem is that what you 're describing is n't bullying . bullying is not applying force to change a person or idea as you claim . bullying is apply force for personal gratification in the pain and suffering of other , often to establish a False sense of control in the bully 's life when they are not actually in control of much of it ."
9y814j,"( usa ) voting should be required by law . voting is a civic duty in the same way that jury duty and paying taxes are duties of each citizen . it ’s perfectly reasonable therefore to introduce legislation that mandates that every citizen exercise this right . otherwise , as we ’ve seen , those rights get eroded . how much harder would it be to get away with suppression if it was costing those voters actual money from their pockets ? the logistics present a problem , and really are n’t crucial to my argument , but i also do n’t think they ’re that hard . enforcement : i ’m not talking about jailing people who fail to vote each year — just a small fine on your tax return , same way the aca added a fine for not carrying insurance . it ’s enough of an incentive to remind people to do it , and if they ’re still just too lazy , they get a slap on the wrist that ’ll remind them to do their homework next year . “ but i want to excercise my right not to vote ! ” ok , fine — sign and return a blank ballot . you ’ve done your duty by submitting a ballot . if you ’re really not voting because you feel it ’s some sort of protest , then this is an easy way to do it . my feeling is that you do n’t care about your rights though , and this is a bad-faith argument . also , 100 % paper ballots . randomized candidate name order on each ballot ( avoid the “ first candidate bonus ” problem ) . what you got , reddit ? cmv !","part of living in a free society is having the ability to choose to not participate in things without being penalized for it . much like restricting cable providers , for example , to only two in a given market , it is much easier for the providers ( or political parties ) to be less responsive to the will of the consumers ( voters ) . but if you allow the option of “ not joining the market until a competitor appeals to me , ” then you increase the chances that either provider ( party ) will change methodology to bring in those voters . if those parties are already getting votes ( because everyone will vote for the closest ideological match ) , then both parties can more easily ignore those in the center — those most likely to abstain — and the parties will more easily move to the fringes while taking the “ forced voters ” with them . so if i do n’t like the candidates i ’m given , i should either vote for someone i believe will either not help me or actively harm me , or be fined ? that way the person who is most willing to pay to see the ticket can see it . it 's a blend of the two where it takes some effort to get the tickets ( e.g. , you have to know exactly when the tickets are going on sale , and be willing to pay a high , but not exorbitant , fee for them . ) say there 's a state law being passed about whether a factory should be allowed to be built on a given lake . one way to decide this issue is if everyone is required to vote . a voter who lives far away from the lake has little to lose if the lake is polluted , but a small amount to gain from the tax revenue from the factory . they care 1 % about the issue . they would n't vote if they were n't required to , but since they are and the factory benefits them slightly , they will likely vote in favor of it . so the factory owners , the recreational users of the lake , and the business owners in the tourist village near the lake should weigh in , and no one else . but if people broadly care about economic or environmental issues in the state , they wo n't be able to weigh in . that means everyone can vote , but only the people who really care about the issue will actually go out to vote . it 's bad if the general public decides whether working mothers should be allowed to breastfeed during work hours or not ( most people do n't care or are slightly against it , but it completely screws over those women if it does n't pass . ) the idea is if you require all eligible voters to vote , democrats would win many more elections . it 's always tempting for the losing football team to want to change the rules to benefit the losing team . the best way to set up the rules is in a vacuum where you do n't consider which teams win and lose with a given rule . in that vacuum , i think the current rule where people are eligible to vote , but are n't forced to is best . i 'd rather increase voter turnout by making voting easier , not by making it mandatory and punishing people that do n't . if people really do n't want to vote they should n't be threatened by a fine . i 'd say make voting day a national holiday and increase the number of polling stations to alleviate hours long lines and make it easier for people to get there . mandatory voting could cause people to just vote randomly which could cause the results to not be representative of the populations wants . voting with universal suffrage is an idiotic way to run anything -- much less an entire country . its much , much better to live in a country with good governance vs. poor governance regardless of the method used to choose leadership or make laws . democracy is not a synonym of good governance nor a synonym of freedom . a democracy with universal suffrage requires the majority of people to be wise in order to have good governance . a monarchy requires only one man to be wise to have good governance . however , naturally a monarch that 's rotten can more easily corrupt a country than in a single or handful of rotten folks in a different form of governance . what makes sense then , is a compromise between the two extremes and allow for a limited suffrage form of governance which would prevent against a corrupt ( or simply incompetent ) king or emperor and against the foolishness of the masses . you can look at the stupidity of democracy with universal suffrage by thinking about how you would go about getting information in order to solve a problem . but you certainly would n't get a copy of the white pages and poll 1000 random names in there and ask them to diagnose the issue . you would n't ask your friend who does n't even have a driver 's license or have never driven a car or worked on one to assist with diagnosing the issue . you would n't take your deaf friend along in hopes that he could hear the noise and identify the issue . instead you would make sure that the people who are working on your car ( which may only be worth $ 40k ) are qualified . you would n't gain anything by asking those who are unqualified to diagnose the issue . if you would n't use democracy with universal suffrage in something that only cost $ 40k ( and unlikely to cost any lives ) why in the world would you think entrusting a country with a budget of ~ $ 4 trillion and can cost the lives of millions in the hands of unqualified individuals ?"
9y7r6d,"america should legalize all drugs . i admit my view on this is pretty strongly held , but i know the devil 's in the details , and it would change my view if someone could point out one or more serious problems with full legalization that i do n't see coming . it would also change my view if someone was able to make an ethical case for keeping drugs criminalized , but that 'll be a tougher row to hoe . the reasoning is this : on an ethical level , it 's wrong to criminalize doing things that are self-harmful if that 's how people want to live . if you want to be the idiot roaring down the highway on a motorcycle with no helmet on , or the idiot snorting coke until your life collapses , that 's not something the government should be in either case entitled to lock you in a cage for , any more than they should be able to lock you in a cage if you risk your life skydiving or drink or eat yourself half to death . on a practical level , if the purpose of criminalizing drugs is to limit harm to the public , it 's not working . america spends a stunning amount of money , as well as endless law enforcement man-hours , chasing drug traffickers and drug users , and the result 50 years later is that hard drugs remain cheap , easily available , and unfortunately cut with all kinds of noxious substances because they 're sold by criminals . in the meantime , powerful gangs are intimidating neighbourhoods and murdering each other , and ambitious people in poverty are being lured into that world , because the illegal trade is both lucrative and apparently impossible to stop . there 's no question that legalizing drugs would create some harm , but it would n't be even close to the harm that prohibition has wrought . in terms of how the legalization scheme would actually work , the government would be the sole authorized seller of drugs , the same way that in canada only the government can sell liquor . they 'd set up dispensaries , there would be no advertising permitted , and the price would be set low enough to undercut and destroy the black market . the drugs would be tested to ensure there are no contaminants and that the active ingredients are kept at a uniform level . it would be impossible to cater to every taste , but if the dispensaries sold marijuana , cocaine/crack , heroine , meth , mdma , lsd , magic mushrooms , and oxy , that would satisfy 99 % of the current black market , which is mission accomplished . anybody who walks in and displays id showing that they 're 21 or older should be able to buy as much they want . if they resell it , who cares ? there would still be laws on the books about selling to children . all the profits from this government program would go into fighting the evils of addiction , which i tend to believe have far more to do with the addict 's mental health and social problems than with the inherent addictiveness of the drug . there would be more addiction , yes , no question about it , but in terms of total suffering , also consider that gang violence would essentially vanish - what 's left to fight over ? overdoses would also become significantly more rare , because most ods happen due to criminals cutting drugs with poisons , or the drug containing an unexpectedly large dose . the dea would be mostly converted into an organization with a mission of stopping human trafficking and sex slavery , which is appalling and should really get more attention from law enforcement . there 's my liberal screed . go to town , folks .","to illustrate the destructive power of drugs , consider that britain used heroin as a weapon against china to secure their own interests . if a group is in a ship and the bottom deck wants to make a hole in the bottom to get water , then if nobody stops them they 'll all sink . personally i 'm for decriminalizing , because yes the way we treat addicts is counterproductive , but only for legalization for drugs with relatively limited potential for societal harm ( weed being an obvious example ) . the issue with many drugs is that they seriously impair rational behavior directly , and then also indirectly since they 're addictive they cause impulsive , irrational behavior in seeking out the next fix . however , i think it ’s the right of society to control what is coming in and out of its community . i think we should legalize more drugs like lsd , mdma , mushrooms , steroids and a few others but allow society to say no to more hardcore stuff like meth and heroine . i ’ve seen what meth does to people and really a person can lose control = bad for society . if we no longer stigmatize the use of drugs , then we must put more resources into treating the effects thereof . people would believe it 's ok to do hard drugs , when in reality , they could lead to addiction , neglect of responsibility , and death . in a free society , people can choose to act hedonistically , having sex and drinking all they want . but these activities are for the most part not addicting ( alcoholism and sex addiction only affect a small percent of the population ) . once addicted , it is next to impossible for the drug addict to choose to quit and live a more noble life . i have to agree with you however that the enforcement of these laws is an incredible failure . also you talk about how it ’s been proven that it ’s impossible to effectively enforce drug laws . just to clarify , if we boil it down , your ideal is that everyone should be allowed to make their own choices , so long as it does not harm anyone else , or at least only in the context of drug use , right ? i agree with your overall assessment , but economics wise , these two points are conflicting . even if the government were to sell at cost with no surplus to pay for other programs , it is highly likely that a few motivated capitalists could produce and sell the same product at a lower cost due to the inherent government inefficiency . if you inflate the cost of the recreational drugs to pay for these other programs , it only increases the potential profit margin of the black market operations ."
9y7ibn,"the goal of reducing global warming to 1.5 °c is unattainable , and humanity should focus more on preparing for the effects of climate change . it matters not how great one 's plan is , it is useless if one ca n't implement it . after looking at the paris accord , and how many countries are failing to uphold it , i am starting to doubt that any climate change prevention strategy is going to work . this is for 3 reasons . 1 ) countries act in self-interest . no country is going to willingly lose power to protect other nations , especially with "" realism "" being the prevailing ideology in international relations . expecting countries to suddenly have a change of heart and help each-other is quite naïve . 2 ) the window for us to stop using fossil fuels has already passed . earth has already warmed by 1.1 °c , and it 's not looking like we 're about to suddenly stop using fossil fuels by 2021 ( what would be required to keep temperatures below 1.5 °c ) . although negative-emissions technology could push that deadline into the future , that technology has n't even been invented yet , let alone tested and implemented ! 3 ) positive feedback loops in the climate system are unpredictable . we could have already screwed ourselves into 3 or more degrees of warming and just not known about it . however , i feel that adapting to climate change is a solution that can stand on its own even without climate change prevention being as impossible as i feel it might be . this is for a further five reasons : 4 ) countries can prepare alone or together . this means that huge trading blocs like the eu and individual countries like north korea can all prepare for climate change without having to wade through red tape . also , since preparedness is ultimately what will decide the fate of any given country , there is more of an incentive to take action . "" take action or you die "" is a lot more effective than "" take action or we die "" ! 5 ) we should always have a backup plan , especially for an issue as important as this . 6 ) humanity is woefully unprepared for even the small amount of climate change we see today . from slow natural disaster responses to a total botching of the handling of refugees ( which climate change will produce a lot of ! ) , our governments have failed to protect their people from the forces of nature , even though technology should be advanced to the point that this does n't happen . 7 ) climate change adaption means more investment in sustainable , resilient technology . this has several positive side effects , such as humanity being better prepared for natural disasters not linked to climate change and people being less reliant on limited natural resources . 8 ) if done properly , preparedness should be relatively cost-effective , as japan has proven time and time again with its resilient infrastructure surviving in one of the most geologically active places in the world . if a densely populated country like japan can figure out how to be prepared for natural disasters , why is the rest of the world floundering ? so , that 's my view . i hope you will be able to find some counterpoints to one or more of my arguments .","so what should happen for a country like the marshall islands , which are at incredibly high risk due to climate change but have minimal resources to do the kind of adaptation you suggest . it is attainable , and countries are already past their goal and further , such as nz , that is no longer using fossil fuels for electricity . as well as this , electric cars are getting an incentive paid for by the tax on fossil fueled vehicles the path would be as follows : a three way deal between mexuscan , the eu , and china where we all agree to a large carbon tax . the left ought to be on board simply to save the environment ; to get the right on board we should make the carbon tax revenue neutral by reducing/eliminating all other taxes ( sales/vat , income , capital gains , etc ) . even if you think fully reversing / fixing climate change is unattainable , it 's not just a binary switch . it 's a process that takes time and will gradually make certain parts of the world harder to live in . i agree we should be thinking about how to "" prepare "" , but much of that preparation is trying to soften the blow , which is pretty much the same as trying and failing to fix it . if we just give up , climate change is going to happen much faster , making preparation that much harder . any reasonable plan of mitigation requires slowing the process in parallel with other preparations . and "" slowing the process "" is basically the same as trying and failing to stop it . so really , we should just keep doing the best we can to change our current climate trajectory , while in parallel preparing for our best guess as to where that trajectory leads ."
9y5lzn,"i can only be happy if i was dumb/ignorant . i will start with climate change . our planet is experiencing an irreversable change in climate that would lead to the extinction of several species and mass migration of people . governments are too inefficient in dealing with it and the population is unwilling to make the many sacrifices necessary like reduction in beef , airplane trips , pizzas and other stuff . and i , as a mere college graduate , ca n't do much to help to change it , and it makes me feel powerless . in order to be tasty , pizzas would have to be cooked with firewood , and these ovens pollute a lot . again with the issue with airplanes , there 's a problem with batteries . batteries are too heavy and inefficient to be a viable power source for airplanes , and making them light and efficient enough is impossible according to the laws of physics . i know that airplanes shortened our travel times by a lot , but human beings are n't meant to fly , we are heavy floor apes and we should n't feel envious for hollowed-out fluffy dinosaurs . birds ca n't be too heavy in order to fly , even big ones like swans weight around ten kilograms . changing the subject , i 'll talk about the rise of the far-right . the rise in criminality and the mass arrival of refugees of a relatively alien culture made it possible in some places . these governments wo n't care about the forementioned climate change and would even accuse the blame on humans of "" cultural marxism "" . the unity of countries is deteriorating , regard for human rights is being diminished , and wwii will probably be "" rebooted "" because collective population of atrocities is too short . everyone who lived through wwii is dying and those born after it are taking the peace for granted and falling for the far-right bait . it does n't even need to be something far in the past like world war 2 . many people in my country are wishing the military regime to return , even because they were n't born at the time , were born in the very end of it , or the nostalgia filter fell in and they were n't directly affected by the regime . also , the forementioned mass migration because of climate change will make everything worse . there are a few things , too . i 'm constantly thinking that the industrial revolution was only possible because europe became rich with the exploration of their colonies . either everyone would remain a shithole , or most places would remain shitholes while a few become rich . in conclusion , the world nowadays makes the infinity war movie look hopeful . p.s. : disregard the title .","i 'll mention the widely accepted ideas of existentialism , which propose that despite living in an absurd and ultimately meaningless and indifferent universe , mankind has the capacity to create his own meaning and happiness . i 'll mention people core to this philosophy , like viktor frankl , who , despite living as a jewish psychiatrist through the terrors of several nazi concentration camps , losing all of his family and friends , and going through extreme trauma and horror , went on to craft the field of logotherapy , which proposed that even in the midst of the worst possible suffering , man has the capacity to persevere and find meaning and joy . he went on to make huge waves in psychology and philosophy , helping countless people . i 'll mention the core tenets of cognitive structuralism , which all effectively describe the roots of happiness as being in our neurologically wired reactionary natures to the things outside and inside of us , not in those things themselves . learning to understand and reshift these wirings , like in cognitive restructuring found in cbt and dbt , can massively shift our mental well-being , even on a physiological level . happiness is far more than just situational , regardless of situation . my best advice for you would be to just live your life because all these things that are stressing you out , are way beyond your control . if you dwell on the possible future , where can you find time to be happy in the present ! and if climate change ends up making earth uninhabitable , we ’ll all be dead !"
9y50g8,"carrying a gun for self-defense as opposed to pepper spray is unnecessary and possibly less safe/effective i ’m neither strongly pro-second amendment or against it . but for my personal form of self defense , i choose pepper spray . i feel i ’d be a lot more likely to use pepper spray against someone making me feel unsafe than i would be to shoot them . shooting carries a lot of weight because of risk of death to another human ( even if you do n’t intend to shoot to kill ) , and i would hesitate in certain scenarios before shooting whereas i would not be concerned to use my pepper spray . the value of all human lives is heavy . i think the only instances i would shoot someone without hesitation would be if i thought hesitating would definitely result in my death or serious injury ( ie they ’re reaching for their gun to shoot me ) . but perhaps someone is harassing me , maybe touches my arm or something and is persistently following me . i tell them to get away from me , but they do n’t . do i pull out my gun and possibly kill them , or pepper spray and safely escape while also not killing another person . pepper spray does not inflict major injury or death to someone like a gun does . it ’s so much easier to use something quickly without thinking when you do n’t have to think about the grave consequences of doing so . just brandishing pepper spray and not even spraying it would be likely to get the offender to leave you alone , no need for pulling out a gun that would also escalate the situation much more and heighten the danger . say the offender manages to disarm you and turn your weapon against you . i ’d much rather have pepper spray in this scenario . accidents with guns are a lot more serious and deadly than an accident with pepper spray . sure , wind can blow it back onto you as well as your target , but i ’d rather have stinging eyes than accidentally kill someone ( maybe a bystander ) or even myself . i do n’t like killing when other options are available . i would n’t judge someone for killing someone threatening them , they are well within their rights . i just prefer to not be lethal if i do n’t have to be . there has been recent debate about allowing students to carry guns on my campus . i live in a high crime area and understand wanting to protect yourself , but i think people should opt for pepper spray instead . everyone is drunk all the time here , i go to a party school . our clubs , parties , and bars are packed . having someone with a gun inside something so packed is nerve-wracking . people fight , get belligerent , ca n’t walk straight . they do not need guns , please god no . this reason alone makes me shudder at the thought of this . in addition to this , college is a high stress time and mental health here can be dismal , easy access to a firearm worries me about potential suicides . you can have your entire life goals wiped out by a single exam . they can commit suicide in other ways , but a gun is quick and having it conveniently accessible to you makes it much easier and likely . classroom debates get heated , i do n’t want to have to think if that student has a gun or not . i support having hired armed guards to prevent mass school shootings . they are trained and know how to handle the situation . i do n’t think billy with his handgun is going to stop a mass shooter with an ar , anymore than someone trying to stop it with pepper spray . police have died trying to stop mass shooters , someone who is not a trained officer has no chance . i add this in here for context , but i ’d rather we focus the debate on effectiveness of guns vs pepper spray than concealed carry on campus , as that is another debate .","just the sight of it is enough to stop 98 % of people in their tracks , no questions asked . failing that , essentially every handgun will give you several reliable follow up shots if the situation has escalated to the point where you are actually pulling the trigger . i wish i could find the video again , but some news outlet did a feature years ago on various pepper sprays available commercially for self defense . the average person charging a victim could fight their way through the pepper spray . some brands were better than others , and all hurt like hell , but it was n't enough to keep the attacker off the victim . but that stuff is n't available commercially ( regardless of how stuff is advertised ) . i do , however , very much respect your desire to not use lethal force as much as possible . there are ~ 16 million conceal carry permit holders in the us . this number is an estimate because not everyone carries , and it does not include states that do not require permits . even when you assume that all 30k gun deaths are caused because someone carried a gun , thats 0.2 % of all permit holders . range is the issue here , you see someone at a distance coming towards you a gun is better than pepper spray and is simply more effective , cause someone could power through pepper spray in a way you could n’t with an organ torn open from a bullet . first off , i do n’t see many scenarios where you would be justified in pepper spraying someone , but not in shooting them . when you use force against someone you are legally required to demonstrate that they showed intent to do you harm , that they had the means to do so ( hands and feet count . twice as many people are killed with them than with rifles . ) you should know that of the active shootings where an armed civilian was present , said civilian was successful at incapacitating the active shooter 75 % of the time . also , the majority of people are n’t in college right now , so i ’m going to ignore that side of your post . pepper spray if someone is harassing you is perfectly fine . to open carry : preventing a person from even messing with you in the first place . if someone does mess with you and is aggressive and is a potential threat , brandishing the weapon alone can end the argument then and there . if that other person has their own weapon , seems to be going for it , if you draw first , you have a right to your own protection . if you ’re in a scenario where you see another person about to : commit a mass shooting - kill someone else - harm your family - etc. you can end them then and there . it ’ll be a joke , you ’ll probably die in most of these scenarios , simply because your morals got you to bring pepper spray to a gun fight instead of a firearm . if you 're in a situation in which you need to use pepper spray on an assailant , you better hope they are n't carrying a gun . according to this ( pdf warning ) fbi report , citizens stopped 8 out of 50 mass shootings in 2016-2017 , 7 of which were citizens with legal ccws . not to mention a handful of incidents that were not included because the shooter was stopped before they met the active shooter definition . as another quick point , i think you may be seriously overestimating how much training police officers receive in actually using the firearms they use . i never was really fond of the idea of myself carrying a gun but carrying just pepper spray would not comfort me . on top of that i also have two cans of pepper spray that i usually leave home legally ( and morally ) you would not use a gun when you are merely being harassed or assaulted with less-than-lethal force . i think most experts would agree that having several options is a good thing because as you said there can be plenty of situations where lethal force is not appropriate . however , in the event your life is in danger , pepper spray is a poor substitute for a firearm . if the bad guy has a gun or other dangerous weapon , pepper spray is less likely to stop the attacker from using their weapon against you . carrying pepper spray but no firearm is just limiting your options and your ability to respond to all threats . it 's like ditching the spare tire and just carrying a patch kit . also , if you do choose to only carry pepper spray , be sure you fully understand your local laws . despite seeming rather harmless , many areas treat pepper spray similarly to other weapons and using it outside of a self-defense situation could be considered a crime . you may not even be allowed to carry it on campus . also a culprit may be less likely to pursue you in the first place if you are carrying a gun rather than a pepper spray . however it 's less uncommon for people to still be able to fight even though they have been pepper sprayed . you have to pepper spray a person in the face and it has to be a good amount . plus , pepper spray relies on you being in a position to use it on said person . as for your shooter scenario , let 's imagine the room had 1 gun for every 3 students and it 's a class of 30 . if a gunman with an ar-15 poped by , 10 of those people have a weapon which the shooter is in range of . if the shooter does n't immediately know who is and is n't armed they 're gon na get killed before many bullets escape their magazine . if all the students had pepper spray though and the assault rifle man showed up no one would be in immediate range to use pepper gas . i ’ve reviewed cases where the aggressor fell over in agony convinced he was going to bleed out and die ... when the officer shot and and completely missed him . on the other hand i know of cases where getting shot is n’t enough to stop someone . the 1981 miami dade shootout between two robbery suspects and fbi agents is the classical case study for this ; both suspects were able to continue fighting and killing after they had been shot multiple times . pure adrenalin kept them fighting . now this is important because it ’s very possible to fight through pepper spray . pretty much every cop and most army gets training to fight through irritants like pepper spray : also keep in mind two that this is just training ; if you ’re hopped up on enough adrenaline or drugs , there ’s a decent chance you wo n’t even feel it the pepper spray . even guns have a hard time stopping people in that state . going back to miami dade , the fbi conducted a study into hand gun ballistics and found that found that you can put bullets into a man ’s heart and destroy the organ completely ; there ’s still enough oxygenated blood in the brain and muscles for a healthy adult male to keep fighting without impairment for 11 seconds . in most cases the gun stops the situation before irreparable harm occurs . i do recall that a state released similar numbers with it ’s police forces ; that the number of times a weapon was drawn far exceeds the number of times that it is actually fired , but i ca n’t remember which state it was . in either case , it should be telling the fact that in most cases the gun stops the encounter without firing a shot or even hurting anyone . the vast majority of the stories do n’t involve any shooting . if the attacker ’s gotten that close to you , then you ’ve already lost the advantage . the main strength of a gun is n’t that it kills better ; you can do more damage physically to someone with a club or a chainsaw . the main strength of a gun is that you can present a threat to someone from a distance , and that distance is important ; the more distance there is , there longer it takes for an attacker to get to you and that gives you time ; time to assess and react to the situation . as an added bonus , the distance helps negate any physical advantages an attacker might have as well . the decision to use force to preserve your own health and life is a deeply personal one and one that can not have a single size fits all , especially given how much of a patch work self defense laws are . having had a full face exposure to oc spray i can say with 100 % certainty that i can still hurt someone if they spray me , and this is with a deliberate exposure during use of force training under ideal circumstances . it sucks ... but i could function enough to perform arresting procedures on a subject ... i would never trust pepper spray as a guaranteed defense . note that over 90 % of gun self defense occurrences do not result in the gun being fired . in almost all cases the attacker flees when the intended victim shows a gun and he realizes his actions may have consequences he does not desire to risk . back to above , if the person is just annoying you , then you probably just committed assault . police use pepper spray and tasers to subdue unruly suspects . pepper spray has varying degrees of effect on people , from screaming their lungs out to some pain but still being able to normally function . carry laws do n't normally allow people to carry while intoxicated . if they are doing so , they 're probably breaking the law same as if there were no campus carry law . if you have the type of student who would murder in class over a debate , do you think such a person would comply with any law banning carry in the first place ? a person carrying comes into play when the shooter walks into his room . well yeah a gun is more lethal than pepper spray , but you also do n't have to shoot for a fatal blow . also unless if i 'm mistaken i 'm not sure there exists any pepper spray out there that can reach beyond 2 meters . so range alone makes a gun better , although a range advantage like that would most likley happen for someone elses defense , since most gun threats are probably within 2 meters . so basically when it comes to quoting your post i would n't say a gun is "" unnecessary "" for self defense when a gun clearly has advantages over pepper spray with range , lethality , and going along with what one person posted , immunity to pepper spray . pepper spray will get in your own eyes if wind is blowing against you with any force . this makes it significantly less effective than guns in many situations . i would always carry a gun where i live because it 's often quite windy around here . just a technical note here : generally people only draw a weapon if they have immediate intention to fire ( police being the main exception ) . the situation is already life or death if a person is drawing in self-defense , so i do n't think there is much more escalating possible ."
9y4f93,"gun control will do nothing to solve gun violence . there is no substantive evidence to support the claim that increased gun legislation or all out bans of private ownership of firearms has done anything to reduce the amount of gun violence present in a given society . removing an individuals ability to defend themselves , their loved ones , and their property is the very antithesis of our constitution . the second amendment is arguably the most important as it is the only security to making sure that the other rights are n’t in danger of being forcibly removed or severely altered . the current narrative that long guns ( ar-15s seem to be the hot ticket item ) are weapons of war and are contributing to mass shootings is misleading and manipulative , undermining our understanding of how these machines function fundamentally and how they impact our society . to solve the gun violence problem , there needs to be an education initiative as well as increased efforts in mental health care . to take away a right that is so integral to our society based on the actions of a few is morally and intellectually dishonest .","while there is no proof that in an alternate universe we would n’t be safer , there also could n’t be , so it is n’t worth saying ; there is , however , tons of evidence that other societies have had very good success in decreasing gun violence . except there are studies that show that countries with gun ownership and strict gun control have less shootings per capita . taking it to the extreme , we can tell that gun control definitely reduces gun violence . if we were to make all guns legal to own at any age and with any background the number of accidental shootings and suicide alone would prove this . if you do n't think a toddler should be able to purchase a firearm , then you 're already a believer in gun control . a general ban on guns would definitely reduce gun violence as it has in countries such as australia or japan where you can get a firearm , but it 's extremely difficult and general sales are banned from the public . the 2nd amendment is a powerful argument for gun ownership though . up until recently , the 2nda was interpreted as allowing gun ownership for individuals unconnected with a membership in a militia , yet the amendment explicitly mentions militias tied to gun ownership . a federal and state central database for background checks that is required to be consulted when selling a firearm whether it 's a public or private sale . if you have a conviction for violence of any kind , you should n't get a firearm . standardized regular firearms training and certification required at reasonable intervals . a side effect would be concealed carry would be included and as long as you 've gone through the training and certification , it would apply in any state ( unless a state has more stringent requirements ) an additional incident would mean a permanent ban . none of these would be a general ban on firearms . as a side effect , this would create a cottage industry for firearm training and certification classes . you 've mentioned both gun violence , as well as mass shootings in your thread . \ > there is no substantive evidence to support the claim that increased gun legislation or all out bans of private ownership of firearms has done anything to reduce the amount of gun violence present in a given society . because i can link to gun deaths in australia decreasing after their gun buyback program ( after which they have never had another notable mass shooting ) , and show you that the usa has an exorbitantly high gun death rate compared to other countries who own less guns . there 's a pretty obvious strong correlation between guns per capita and gun violence per capita , whether it 's on a country or state level . though that 's somewhat of a unique situation influenced by geography , the principle remains in other states ( it 's just a multiple hour drive , which would probably not be a deterrent for anyone who needs a gun ) . long guns are better for shootings due to their ability to kill more efficiently . you probably know that long guns are usually capable of holding higher capacity magazines ( which , yes , are usually illegal in the areas they 're used in mass shootings - part of the half baked approach that i do n't agree with ) . i do agree with universal mental health services , which would likely help people who are prone to mass shooting events ( though those make up a minority of all shootings , the rest of which are usually gang related ) . just yesterday , there was a post here on reddit about how a toddler shot himself accidentally because he got ahold of a gun that someone left loaded under their pillow . handguns contribute far more to gun deaths , and most of those deaths are not homicides but are instead suicides or negligent discharges , particularly children finding their parents unsecured firearms . however , you make a few claims that i think beg a corrolary be presented . first of all , you claim "" no substantive evidence to support the claim that increased gun legislation or all out bans of private ownership of firearms has done anything to reduce the amount of gun violence present in a given society "" . that 's patently False - there are plenty of case studies showing that reduced access to firearms does decrease firearms related deaths , plenty of other nations to use as reference , and honestly that much is just common sense because if there are less guns , obviously there will be less gun deaths . what i would instead ask you to present is any evidence that increases in guns do not increase gun violence , or moreover that increases in guns lead to a safer society . strong 2a proponents love to argue "" nobody has proven less guns are safer "" but where is the evidence that more guns are safer either ? i call these arguments the "" arms race "" , "" mexican standoff "" , or "" battle royale "" approaches to gun control . e.g. people argue we need every man , woman , and child to be packing heat - teachers should be armed in schools , etc. . and if everyone has a gun than nobody will commit gun violence because everyone will be scared of "" good guys with guns "" . why is making everyone look over their shoulder constantly waiting for the boogieman in the shadows a better approach to dealing with violence in society than - you know - reducing the violence and tools of violence in society ? why encourage people to approach life with this cowbody vigilante mindset that leads to abuses of "" stand your ground "" laws , which we have seen plenty of evidence for even in just the last few years ? and honestly - there are currently enough guns in this country that an estimated 1 in 3 people is packing heat , yet gun violence persists and does n't seem to deter anyone ... how does more guns help again ? ( answer , usually standing across the street strapped up in gear like they 're about to go to war , hoping the swat teams will come in with tear gas and riot shields to beat down minorities ) . the president recently threatened to attempt an executive order to remove 14a ... again , where was the 2a crowd to defend the constitution then ? when the rate of fire of guns was a round a minute and both sides were about equally armed , it kinda made sense ... these days , not so much . what you get in the 21st century are riot police rolling around in literal tanks and apc 's buying up machine guns to deal with protestors - supported by the 2a crowd to do so . 2a at that point does nothing to defend the constitution - if anything it helps unravel it by suppressing freedom with threats of violence and fear . or are you suggesting that this is a universal truth , and that even countries like singapore where there are strict gun laws and basically zero murders would somehow get even more safe if they were to make guns widely available ? i 've replied to a few people in this thread already , but most of their research compares % of gun deaths per state vs. their gun ownership rate . 60-65 % of gun deaths are suicide , and what is more useful is gun homicide vs gun ownership . while we should improve our mental healthcare , it 's incorrect to think that doing so would have a substantial impact on the gun violence problem in the u.s. reading through the article linked , it becomes clear that one very important risk factor in violent behavior is substance abuse . this is something that gun control could easily and directly deal with : if everyone who attempted to purchase a gun had to show they were not consuming illegal substances , we could make progress towards solving the issue of gun violence . tl ; dr mental illness is n't a significant issue when it comes to gun violence , but substance abuse is and gun control could help to reduce gun violence through ensuring drug users do n't have access to guns ."
9y4asa,"a revenue neutral carbon tax is the simplest , cheapest , best way to address climate change . # step one : tax carbon emissions . # step two : take the proceeds of carbon tax & redistribute it to the people who paid it ( preferably by lowering income tax ) . & #x200b ; & #x200b ; in all honesty this is henry jacobi 's idea & it 's best explained here : [ -- url -- ) we have all the talent we need to address emissions , we just need the incentives . a tax on emissions is the obvious solution . people will have the freedom to lower their emissions whichever way works best for them . the problem is a carbon tax will be a drag on the economy & disproportionately harm the poorest among us . much of that harm can be addressed by making the tax revenue neutral . individuals are still motivated to favor low emission services & goods , but at the end of the period they get their fair share of that tax back . this makes it effective & affordable for the individual .","revenue neutral is a bad idea because it is only ever revenue neutral at the onset . afterward , there will be a gap between revenue generated by the tax and the lack of income from the income tax reduction . we 're supposed to have net 0 emissions by 2050 so hypothetically if we did , the tax would be $ 0 but we already lowered income tax . that way each year the distribution exactly equals the money raised from the carbon tax . people of high income groups are more willing to go for greener alternatives , due to increasing oil prices other alternative will be cheaper in near future it ’s not cheapest because corporations will dump massive , massive amount of money to sue , lobby and run propaganda against it . for example , a us company selling to india is at a disadvantage because they do n't have a carbon tax while we would . you could come up with all sorts of tarriffs and export tax exemptions , but it would not be simple . there is also the fact that voters do n't like carbon tax . washington tried what you describe and it was rejected by voters twice ( one of which was revenue neutral ) ."
9y362h,"government inaction is heading us towards irreversible climate catastrophe . as time progresses , more and more damning reports which say we are heading for irreversible climate change are being released . take for example a relatively optimistic report by the ipcc which essentially issues a 12 year deadline to a point of no return . a 1.5 degree increase in global temperature will cause massive issues all across the globe , and an increase greater than 2.0 degrees will be will catastrophic for everyone to say the least . there are many private and public initiatives which are cleaning up our earth one step at a time . take for example dutch ngo , the ocean clean up which is doing inspiring work coming up with unique and innovative ways to rid the seas of pollution detrimental to marine life . with this being said , when i look to my and other governments around the world , it 's almost as if the message has n't registered . i am not saying that nothing is being done , but more that the people with the most power to evoke change appear to be the most lackadaisical about the whole process . in fact in some cases it seems like they only care about making a buck now . take for example australia . in summary the current ruling party insists that the country rely on coal for electricity even though some states have successfully run completely on renewables and even had an excess of power on their grids ( south australia as the most successful example ) . the current party is so in love ( or paid to be in love ) with coal that prime minister scott morrison even brought some into parliament . with all this being said , i just wonder why the premise of catastrophic climate change is n't causing immediate and noticeable action from governments . the sad irony is the people with the least power to act will be the most affected . i could just blame it on corruption , or lobbying from the industries which perpetuate the problem , but surely those in charge do n't have their hands tied that tight ? right ? i may not be the most informed person on the topic of climate change , but from my perspective , it sure seems like more could and should be done but just plain is n't . that being said i might be missing something that tears apart my whole view , so please cmv . tl ; dr : there has been consensus that climate is changing , yet from my point of view not enough is being done . this may be due to corruption or other factors . the people with the most power to evoke change should be doing so , but are n't .","questioning the answers , especially from those in charge , is so important , yet it feels like it ’s conversations like this that will really make change happen . history ( mostly hidden ) & the way the 1 % is privately preparing for it , tell us we missed a few very important meetings . the earth may continue to heat up , there is compelling research pointing to a poles shift , i truly suggest we look at the government with a completely unveiled mind if we sincerely want to help earth with her flora , fauna , & people alike . - the difference between “ global warming ” & “ climate change ” & which one we can fix - opposing political positions on the climate issues & why they wo n’t leave the ballots . even if the above research leads nowhere for you , let ’s commit to find our own truths and remember our humanity overall . something criminals and people without education have done for decades are flourishing still and government , with a full on monopoly to sell weed and get all the profit , has screwed it up . they may not be profitable for another year or two . they made a deal with canada post which was already set to go on strike . they did n't have enough supply . they did n't even know what to charge and are charging too much , keeping the black market a huge option . just coming to say , that there is in fact a movement , which wants to force the governments to do something through a strike . you want to punish co2 emitters , but you are less able to do so because the polluters enjoy protection under the law . in fact , you are forced to pay taxes that fund this protection , in opposition to your own interests . absent the government taking action it falls on the shoulders of the public , and the individuals making up the public . on the macro scale , if we force sub-optimal action through legislation , people will die . there is a set amount of resources available right now . taking these resources away from their current allocations and moving them to try and reign in climate change will take them from the current poorest people in the world . even if we decided it was overall best to sacrifice some people now to prevent the long-term impacts of climate change , the second problem is logistic . the problem is there is no way to force everyone to put this tax in place at the same time . for sake of example , if you do n't like the countries i picked , substitute in ones you prefer . the problem in this example now is the bad countries are producing goods cheaper ( because no carbon tax ) and then selling them to all the other countries . if the next solution is some sort of sanctions this is going to further depress the involved economies and again cause more deaths . governments have been useful in pollution control and wildlife protection , but when it comes to global warming the best governments have been able to offer are cap and trade carbon credit schemes . if you ’re so concerned about this , worry less about economic schemes , or even the science portion of data collection and future predictions , and get invested on the engineering end . worry about how energy is extracted , collected , and distributed , and do your part educating yourself and others about the science / engineering of oil/gas/renewables , instead of complaining and begging the government like they could come up with anything besides a tax scheme . the entirety of your claim rests on a False premise : climate change is a catastrophe . in the 20th century , there was a nation state with the means and will to kill everyone that was n't of their race and impose a political system upon the world . eventually , the sun is going to grow so luminous , that it will melt the oceans and destroy life on the planet . scientists seem to focus on these issues as if they are catastrophic . i would however argue , that there is a wide array of very severe threats being faced , and in the order of those most imminently catastrophic , our resources are already allocated . \ - last but not least , the development of industry to give us the means to support these endeavors . should we weaken our countries comparative to others ( adversaries ) , who may or may not follow suit with the changes ( the psychopath advantage ) ? the collapse of the global economy would be far worse for humanity than a temperature increase of 2 degrees . the growing season for farmers around the globe would be extended . this is also the most likely reason for why said countries are n't investing in climate . russia in particular stands to gain a lot of sea trade routes out of the global warming and has already started positioning itself to make claims on the slowly unfreezing northern islands . humanity and multicellular animals in general thrive in warm periods and fail in cold periods . human civilization peaks in warm periods and falls into violence during cold periods . looking beyond humanity , the geologic record reveals that earth has the highest biodiversity during warm periods and the lowest during cold periods . the only way to do what you want is for the us to use military force on emissions of other nations that are growing . developing nations in india and africa and south america need fossil fuels . to make them cut emissions is to keep them 3rd world nations and slow their progress of growth and technology . renewable energy is becoming cheaper to make and when it goes below coal or oil that 's when the change will happen . also that 's just a fraction of what causes climate change anyway . the earth changes climate naturally so we need to combat that which i have seen many methods from reflective fields to reduce sun rays to bacteria that consume methane . so you have to keep in mind also that the main reason the united nations and other countries were mad that the united states withdraw from the paris accords was all about money and not about real change . the evidence was clear when india and china we 're taking some of the money from the united nations under the guise of getting off coal power while increasing the rate of new coal burning plants . the united nations even admitted that even if every nation hit there goals we still fail so why were we obligated to send tax dollars to a wasted cause ? it got dirty vehicles off the road ... great idea until people bought newer suvs to replace them . solar and wind are nice but we do n’t have the battery technology to have zero carbon storage of the energy . it would be great to shut down some coal plants and use more solar ... or would actually go a long way , but science has not provided a solution yet . there ’s a lot of reasons for optimism , but consumption habits and lack of alternative technologies to fully replace what we have would be another reason . we need to fix both and we can make a huge impact with technology we do have , but unlike when we jumped on cfcs with government action ( that we only recently got to a point where the atmosphere is healing ) , we do n’t have all the substitutes and we did n’t have to completely change out a lot of things that people already used . if 95 % of climatologists agree that climate change has been largely due to human activities in the last 150 years , what ’s to argue ? the fact that liberals love to make rich people out to be boogiemen makes me skeptical of the most threatening assertions about climate change ."

9y20sm,"to reduce abortions in the us , it would be more effective to provide universal healthcare rather than to create anti-abortion laws . there are many people in the us that want to prevent abortion . i 've heard some people even say the main reason they wanted justice kavanaugh on the scotus is to change abortion laws . i too agree that having less abortions would be better . but i do n't think anti-abortion laws would be as effective as some people think . first of all , before you try to reduce abortion rates the first thing you should do is look at the reasons people get abortions . this website gives a general overview for some reasons : -- url -- a main factor for abortions throughout the various times , and among the various states is socio-economic . to me this makes a lot of sense . on average us hospital deliveries cost $ 3500 . -- url -- meanwhile only 39 % of americans have enough savings to cover a $ 1,000 emergency . -- url -- so if i was a woman living in the us faced with this sort of economic problem . i 'd be incentivized to find some way to get an abortion . and this is n't even factoring in the cost of raising a child . anti-abortion laws would just promote desperate people to find more unsafe options for having an abortion since it would not change their motivation for having an abortion . universal healthcare , however , would take a step in changing a woman 's motivation for having an abortion by alleviating a major cost of having a child . obviously there would still be other factors to consider in reducing abortion rates . but still , for those against abortion , the target should be in changing women 's motivations for an abortion rather than in changing laws to prevent abortion . thanks for the debate . i accept defeat in that using universal healthcare to reduce abortions is not a strong argument . however i still think that it would be better than anti-abortion regulations . and since no responded to that side of the argument i 'll maintain that stance . anyway , i 'm done responding to new responses . i might still continue previous threads .","here is a study supporting the idea that making abortion illegal can reduce the number of abortions . this is especially True when women have good health care ( whether or not universal health care would be good can be reserved for another debate ) . “ these data suggest that over time , restrictive laws may have a restraining effect on the practice of abortion and promote its decrease . in fact , chile exhibits today one of the lowest abortion-related maternal deaths in the world , with a 92.3 % decrease since 1989 and a 99.1 % accumulated decrease over 50 years . ” “ ... a plausible hypothesis after the chilean study is that abortion restriction may be effective when is combined with adequately-implemented public policies to increase educational levels of women and to improve access to maternal health facilities . maybe teaching men and women ( mostly women ) to take a healthier and more mature approach to sex would fix the problem too . obviously accidents happen , and that 's what things like the morning after pill and abortions are for , but they happen much more than they should for how cheap a box of condoms is compared to having a baby . it would be more effective to just stop federal funding of abortion than either of those options . if anything is changed in the states it would be the government sending it back to the states and each state could decide what they wanted to do . it 's a moral issue and it 's not fair that someone 's tax dollars would go towards something they find morally wrong . the states could say yes or no and people could always go to another state if they wanted an abortion . people want to prevent abortion but they also want people to do it willingly and not in a way that violates their idea of the prevention of life . there are plenty of things in life that work this way . these people do n't just want someone to prevent abortion , they want people to take responsibility for their own actions the whole time . you make it seem like kids stop costing money after birth . the purpose of anti abortion laws is ethical , not logical , in nature . it is not simply to reduce abortions , but to eliminate them as criminal and punish those who would seek them . proponents believe that abortion is an act of murder against another human being , and depriving that human being of life should not be condoned for any reason you would n't apply to an adult human . giving birth is n’t an emergency , you have several months to save up , and you can typically set up payments . you could achieve the same thing by only paying costs associated with pregnancy . then there ’s the fact the cost concerns are n’t with giving birth , but the cost of raising a ( nother ) child . the latter can only be solved by abortion , while the former ( the reason being given for abortion ) can be solved by adoption . reduce abortion = increase adoptions . therefore , they need more welfare and healthcare enough for underage kids . you forgot to address the fact that those people who are against abortion are also anti birth control and sometimes anti sex-ed . the most effective way to decrease abortions is to provide real sexual education and allow women to have birth control for free with the method she chooses meaning pills , patch , implant , ring , iud , etc . people will still want abortions even if the birth is free to them . universal healthcare does n’t work , along with other socialist issues , when you artificially stimulate demand the cost raises therefore if you have the bare minimum competition will shine through and drop the cost of medical services i suppose we are going to completely disregard the 30 + trillion dollars that it would take to operate the country with full universal health care . the increase of taxes alone would obliterate any “ savings ” that the parent might experience through this idea . bankrupting the country with subpar medical care is how the country collapses . there are plenty of people who want to get sterilized , but doctors refuse , sometimes because of morality , and sometimes because of fear of malpractice suits . no one is forcing anyone to have sex , outside of the despicable and illegal act of rape . if you put that thing in that place , you 're on the hook for the consequences that have been present since long , long , looooong before man . there are arguments to be made for pregnancies that result from rape and pregnancies that threaten the mother 's life . regardless of any healthcare options , abortion should be considered illegal in most situations ."
9y1xov,"many people only do n't care about the aborted babies , because they are the "" others "" . everything else are just rationalizations . first of , i 'm personally rather apathetic towards abortions and i could n't care less to be honest . nevertheless , i consider a fertilized zygote already as ~ ~ living ~ ~ human life because it 's the least common denominator of what intelligent human life can be ( thus i can be considered pro-life in a way ) . my reasoning is more or less similar as to how some people care much more about highly intelligent animals ( like apes , octopodes , dolphines , etc ) much more than the unintelligent ones . it 's just that in the end , it may sound harsh , i do n't care about them enough that i would allow them to affect me . ( so i will readily support pro-abortion positions , because the pro-choice camp mainly argues that the unborn child is n't alive yet , though practically i 'm rather a pro-choice . ) i believe that most people who support abortions have the same core reasoning as me , only that they usually need rationalization as to why they do n't care about them ( that is by more or less arbitrary deciding where "" life "" should start ) , as to not feel bad about themselves . in fact , i believe it 's just another phenomenon of the general apathy towards "" the other "" . similar to unborn babies , people who are far away/are different and/or do not affect us , just do n't concern us or at least they concern us less . sure , we may read about some atrocities and horrible living conditions here and there , but i doubt that a majority will loose a much time thinking about it if it 's not somewhere in its cultural sphere . it 's similar how the "" west "" is very much into human rights , but does n't care if purchasing oil from a certain regions which disregards them . that 's why the "" west "" reacts to terrorist attacks happening in the west much more dramatically when they happen anywhere else and even much more frequent . similarly it also applies to slavery ( where people give and gave more or less arbitrary points what constitutes a slave ) . i think you get the basic idea . most people need this rationalization or othering to support abortion , because usually people are taught that "" human life is valuable "" and thinking otherwise is evil ( thus if human zygote == not alive , then human zygote == not valuable ) and because unborn babies are in some sort of uncanny valley of the otherness . on the one hand they are physically rather close to the parents , but on the other hand they do n't really interact with them like anything else which is living . also , i do n't think that bodily autonomy of the woman is relevant to the rationalization , because if it were , there would n't be a pattern that most people support abortion less and less the further in the pregnancy is . if it were really about bodily autonomy of the woman , the support of abortion should be around the same at least till around the last weeks , but it is n't and that 's because the baby resembles more and more a human being . i 'm not arguing whether abortions are immoral or not . imo if you think "" human life has value "" then you should think it 's immoral , but that 's beside the point . i 'm mainly arguing that the main reason we are willing to be arbitrary as to what alive is ( where in other places we do n't usually pick a grey area ) , is because an unborn baby is usually "" the other "" .","life does n't begin at conception : it began four billion years ago , and has been continuous since then . even human life does n't begin at conception : it began somewhere between three hundred thousand and two million years ago , depending on how you count . the idea that any notion of when "" human life begins "" is relevant to the abortion issue is ridiculous , and this is evidenced by the fact that almost no one has any problem with medical procedures that result in the death of other things that are unambiguously human life , such as cancerous tumors , appendixes , foreskin , etc . i am not aware of any mainstream pro-choice group that holds this view . i am not even aware of any ' crazy loner ' pro-choice person who argues this . pro choice people are thinking about the millions of baby who are born to parents who do n't want or ca n't handle them . a zygote is n't a person , and as such is n't particulary valuable . which is also why we take human life that no longer contains a person ( braindead people ) from life support eventually . animals abort young and kill babies when the situation dictates . there are situations humans can find themselves in that dictate the same activity ."

9y117l,"joe biden with a woman running mate is the democrats ' best bet to beat trump in 2020 to be clear : i am not taking this view because biden is my favorite or ideal candidate . i am taking this view because i think this is the most likely victory scenario . i am totally open to having my view changed by compelling evidence . biden has consistently made the top projections for candidates who may beat trump . wapo puts him at # 4 . reuters puts him at the top of the polls . politico has him ahead also . usa today . vox . i realize that biden is in his mid-70s , but he 's not that much older than trump . if he picks a younger woman ( kirsten gillibrand , amy klobuchar ) of color ( kamala harris , tulsi gabbard ) , he could hit the trifecta : he could win those rust belt states , formerly blue that went obama and then trump , like pa , wi , and mi , by appealing to working-class white men . having a woman running mate would prevent the ticket from seeming like a sausage party , which would not draw in progressives . his choice of a strong woman running mate could give the ticket wide-ranging appeal demographically , with progressives . if he dies in office ( god forbid ) , the vp pick has to be someone that people would love to be president , not someone they dread , ala pence . biden will also bring out the obama faithful who grew to love him in his close relationship with barack . i realize that joe biden is more of the same centrist , old school democrats . i also realize that he has n't been successful in previous attempts at being elected . however , based on polling , based on the idea that he represents more of the obama era for people who have grown nostalgic , and the fact that the democrats have to split themselves by appealing to working class white voters , people who care about military service , centrists , but also the youth demographic , a desire for diversity by young progressives , etc. , i think joe biden is likely to win nomination . admittedly , there are likely flaws in my reasoning . do you think a younger , more progressive person at the top of the ticket could win ? or should it be bernie sanders ? elizabeth warren ? someone else ? who and why ? change my view !","biden has tried multiple times and failed to win the democratic nomination . boomers are the ones who have screwed things up by grabbing everything for themselves , it 's time to pass the reins and let a younger generation screw things up differently in new and interesting ways . while i would love for the nominee to be a person of color , better yet , a woman of color , i hate to say that i think a white man would stand a better shot of beating trump . the republicans won the previous ( 2014 ) senate race in texas by a margin of 27.2 % . so o'rourke 's charisma and the anti-trump motivation made a huge difference , putting even a state so rigidly republican in play for the democrats . i think he could motivate a lot of people , and his vigor would look really good to trump 's failing health . in the end , i personally would vote for nearly anyone besides trump , but i think tactically the best chance to defeat him would be a white male . the best way to beat trump is by not picking candidates that even moderate republicans would never vote for . biden eliminated himself the moment he awarded w this week . it makes more sense for democrats to favor candidates who will fully motivate their base from every angle ( economically progressive , also representing minorities ) , than to do a half-assed compromise on exactly the wrong issues and end up with someone who will motivate neither the working classes with a strong leftist economic agenda , nor the sjws by being the wokest , youngest , snowflakeiest candidate , but awkwardly falls between the two in an attempt to please the republicans ' perception of themselves . all comments that earned deltas ( from op or other users ) are listed [ here ] ( / r/deltalog/comments / 9yb0ql/deltas i would much rather see a True progressive , genuinely and positively passionate , anti-trump ticket . while yes biden and a female vice president is a thousand times better the train wreck that was hillary and kain in that last election . the democrats would be better running a progressive or a farther left candidate then just running a centrists or a neo liberal to try to steal conservatives votes . hillary tried that and failed against trump and the dems been trying to do that in smaller races which also failed as well . i 'm not sure if this quite counts as being in opposition to your view , but i do n't think it 's to anyone 's benefit to plan out a ticket ahead of time . this is going to sound a little crazy , but i 'm convinced that the democrats need a strong primary season , and that party leadership should stay out of it . a good example of this , i think , popped up in the wisconsin gubernatorial elections . in 2014 , there was one name that got out there and boom , that was basically it , everyone stepped out of her way ( except one guy who had no real chance of winning ) no real primary , and she turned out not to be as strong a candidate as people had hoped , which meant not a lot of enthusiasm , walker wins reelection by a significant margin . this year , they basically threw the doors wide open , half a dozen candidates in the primary and it was basically anybody 's race . i got the sense that even the people whose candidate lost had a thought of "" okay , i wish my candidate had won , but this guy was chosen by the people of the state , fair enough "" , so instead of the kind of divisive bickering you had in 2016 ( with the hillary vs. bernie situation ) people were willing to come together and turn their enthusiasm from the primary on him , turnout is historic , and walker is defeated . so projecting this onto a national model , if the democrats can hold a primary that 's focused on the issues ( rather than devolving into a mudslinging fest like the 2016 primaries ) , i think that creates the best chance that even people who voted against the winner in the primary will be willing to back them in the general , if they feel like their candidate lost fair and square . all this said , i do n't think biden being one of the primary candidates would be a bad thing . but he should be no more or less than any other candidate , so that if he does win , you do n't get the thing you did with hillary where people felt ( accurately or otherwise ) that their candidate had been "" robbed "" in favor of her . biden is very easy to label as more of the same washington machine that kept congress working against the people ’s interests for generations , and kept obama from even trying to change washington . obama and trump and bernie all gained popularity by introducing the idea that change is vital . but if a young minority candidate had the same genuine passion and could appeal to those turned off by tribalism , she could do well , too . the campaign itself dramatically changes that by giving candidates tons of exposure . a few months later he was projected to do better than clinton in a hypothetical race against trump . at this point biden is probably doing well in these types of polls because everyone knows who he is rather than because they are particularly enamored with him . imo the best shot democrats have is running an unknown , who can create a completely positive brand before they the national conservative media has had years to drag it through the mud , someone like seth moulton , eric swalwell , joe kennedy will probably try to step up . vice president biden constantly puts his foot in his mouth . he does n't provide good contrast with president trump over respect for women . and she would carry the midwest which is what made the difference in 2016 . pair her with a male of color and thats hard to beat ."
9y10ud,"people should not be prohibited from doing anything only harmful to themselves . it 's very simple and i see now reason why a lot of these laws exist . why would we prohibit someone from , say , doing heroin ? they 're only harming themselves , after all . of course , people under the influence of a drug are more likely to commit other crimes , but we do n't ban alcohol because it could potentially be harmful while driving , we ban drunk driving . someone doing heroin in their own home should be perfectly legal . another example would be underage smoking/drinking . is it stupid ? yes . does it harm anyone else ? no . change my view .","if someone is planning or attempting to commit suicide , it can usually be assumed that they are in a state of mind that deprives them of their ability to properly rationalize . do you consider the monetary costs of supporting the addict , or the treatment for the damages caused by nonfatal overdoses to be harm to society ? that drug use makes you less productive in society , more likely to commit heinous crimes , and the medical damage you do to yourself will cause resources to be diverted away from people who did not choose to use heroin . you buying heroin means you are supporting a drug lord ( right now , anyway ; would be different if legalized ) and not supporting , say , girl scouts with that money . you are thus harming the girl scouts , while benefiting the drug lord , who will also harm others later now that they are well-funded . the harms outweighed the benefits , so we legalized it again . we make drunk driving illegal , not because alcohol alone is harmless , but because drunk driving is more harm than benefit . ( note : drunk driving is completely harmless to everyone , because nobody is hurt while drunk driving ; it is just the crashing thing that is harmful , so why not legalize drunk driving , too , and just let car crashes be illegal ? ) we make underage smoking/drinking illegal because we believe that people of that age are incapable of making good decisions , and the harm will grossly outweigh any benefit . you see , everything you do brings about harm to others , and if it was possible to calculate perfectly every decision you ever make , then we would probably make it illegal for you to do anything other than that which brings about the least harm and produces the most benefit . you either need to be more specific with what constitutes "" harm "" , or accept that everything is harmful to someone so there is little benefit in discussing the legality of non-existent actions ."
9y0bou,"hate speech should n't be illegal in the usa i believe that the first ammendment protects all kinds of spoken and written speech . this includes horribly offensive things in public places . if we set the precedent of censoring public speech then we are giving the government too much control over our speech and that power could be abused in the future . of course , this excludes any call to action . by that i mean : "" i wish that n would just die already ! "" would be legal ( it 's still terrible of course ) . "" can someone please kill that n "" would be illegal since it 's calling action against someone . please try to change my view : )","that said , as other people have pointed out , hate speech is not illegal in the united states , pretty much for the exact reasons you are describing . this relates to the so called paradox of tolerance , which is the idea that in order to be tolerant we must tolerate intolerance . could you be more specific about what laws , or what parts of the canadian legal definition of hate speech you find objectionable ? both of those sentences you propose are legal under canadian hate speech laws . ( there is a lot of right-wing propaganda about what is or what is n't legal under canadian hate speech laws ) hate speech is legal in the us , except in the case it is inciting violence . depending on the popularity of the person , the former will be understood as a call to action as much as the latter . i mean , if you use hate speech , people should be allowed to take action ."
9y06ue,"( american ) bicyclists are subsidized by car owners so this is a weakly held view borne out of a conversation with an uber driver . i 'm a student who owns only a bicycle . i was taking an uber to the airport , and while in conversation with the driver , he said that he really hated all the bicycle lanes that were propping up all around the city , more so because the roads were built from his road taxes . i said that i preferred bikes because that way i did n't have to pay license plate and insurance fees , and he said that was cheating . i ca n't find any flaws in his argument , and therefore am forced to accept that cyclists are freeloading on roads paid for by automobile owners . ( do note that a cyclist pays most other kinds of taxes , like income tax and sales tax ) . since tax policies and budget allocations would vary from country to country , this view is mostly in the american context . his view has a greater merit because cyclists are not just sharing lanes available to other vehicles , they 're actually getting reserved lanes which were previously available to cars , so arguments like bicycles do n't cause wear and tear of roads are not valid . points that would not change my view : 1 . cycling is environment-friendly , and the future of urban commuting in the face of increasing urban congestion . ( i know and accept that , and that 's not what i 'm arguing on ) 2 . the view is technically correct but we need to promote cycling , and if we levy road taxes we ca n't do that . 3 . cyclists only account for a small percentage of road users , so it 's not a significant subsidy . ( the lanes have been reserved , irrespective of how much usage they have ) point that would change my view : 1 . data that shows that road/license plate taxes account for only a small fraction of the road construction costs 2 . sophisticated arguments like american gas price is heavily subsidized by the mammoth amounts its military/intelligence spends on interfering in the middle-east . ( i know that 's a fact but i 'm looking for simpler/other arguments ) , which is paid for by other taxes as well . .","and in general uber drivers are some of the worst bike lane abusers , so i do n't feel too bad for him . i do n't have a problem with cyclists having their own lanes . i have a problem with cyclists using vehicle lanes , as they obstruct traffic . car owners incur costs to the entire planet by driving their cars in the form of future climate change mitigation . it makes perfect sense that they should be charged to help with the effort to combat climate change . in oregon as part of hb 2017 we passed a $ 20 surcharge on bicycles that funds bicycle infrastructure . so they are n't entirely freeloading except that they would n't be free loading in the first place since we quite frequently replenish the highway trust fund from the general fund since the gas tax no longer funds enough to build all that we want to build . so your income tax will quite frequently be used to fund highway "" improvements "" or bicycle infrastructure . the difference between wear-and-tear that a two ton vehicle commits on the road versus a bicycle is massive . plus cars have a whole registration system that has to be financed ( the dmv , driving tests , a database for police access , and all the staff required to make this stuff work ) which does n't apply to bicycles . it 's a map of how much of a state 's road are paid for by vehicle fees , taxes , etc . the cars are destroying what should be an easy infrastructure for people to walk and bike and turning it into a gridlock nightmare . i think cars stole the roads from pedestrians and bicyclists and slowly dars are reclaiming it . only half ( up from a third in 2010 ) of state and local roads are paid for by users of roads . the typical household generally pays $ 1,100 extra to cover the cost of drivers . in a 100 % user driven model , they would have to pay the most because they are among the highest users . first is the 50 % subsidy above , but they also are just considered regular cars in most places so they avoid the licensure fees paid by commercial drivers ( e.g. , cabs , truck drivers ) . ultimately , cyclists are being subsidized , but not by car drivers . but the net of the subsidies and taxes is that carfree cyclists overpay by $ 250 each and car users underpay by 50 % ( i 'm not sure exactly what the dollar value is ) . you are making the False assumption that the only cost associated with roads is the cost to build and maintain them . government already owns the land that is occupied by roads , so allocating that land to cars rather than bikes is n't going to increase the tax burden . but it still incurs an opportunity cost because cars consume a lot of land , and that land could have been used for something else of economic value . a mere 50 people driving their cars down an avenue have more land allocated to them than thousands of pedestrians walking down the same avenue . if you can convince large numbers of commuters to use bikes instead of cars you can free up land ( eg . once you factor in the opportunity costs , switching from a car to a bike can actually be a net economic positive for the public . a bike lane that few people use is n't an efficient use of land either . you need to build a critical mass of bike lanes before people start using them en masse . on the other hand , if there were no cars , you probably would n’t even need to bike ( i.e. density would allow waking/biking/public transportation literally everywhere you would need to go ) . and if you did , bike “ lanes ” would be absolutely everywhere , and be very cheap to create . the money drivers pay in taxes typically goes funding statewide road projects . most cyclists only use local roads and stay off state highways ( which lack bike lanes ) . local roads are normally funded at the city level through property taxes and city funding projects . since cars use highways a lot and cyclist rarely use them , they are n't really subsidized for their usage . i think its clear that the more money put into bike lanes , the more people riding , the more people on public transport actually creates a better environment for cars . cyclists are not freeloading . they are actively making it a better driving experience by not driving . my dad always used to say ' public transport is great so i can drive my car with no one on the road ' . if i wanted clear roads , i might invest in bike paths and public transportation and start a ' let 's bike ' campaign ."
9xzfwv,"finland won the winter war ok so let 's look at the aim of both countries . russia : wanted a quick victory to secure leningrad and because they suspected the nazi 's may go through finland to invade them . finland : keep their independence . results of the battle . russia : kicked out of the league if nations , military reputation in tatters , was extremely slow at not even taking finland , ended up making the finnish allying with the germans for operation barbarossa , of which the germans greatly wanted the closer access to cities . finland : lost some land , gained international respect , got given lots of equipment and maintained independence . the only real to say that finland lost was because they surrendered , but i 'd argue since finland did vastly better for its goals that they won .","if failing to break defensive lines and having horrific casualties is sufficient to say that they lost the war then a similar argument could be made for the allied powers in ww1 . getting kicked out of the league of nations is pretty meaningless , the league was all but dead already , having failed to stop japanese ( against china ) , italian ( against ethiopia ) and german ( pretty much all their neighbours ) aggression . in the end , unless the league of nations was going to be able to stop the soviet union taking territory it really did n't matter . when the continuation war began finland managed to retake most of their lost territory but failed to take either murmansk or cut off the supply line , in essence failing to achieve anything that would actually hurt the soviet union . the one who wins the war is the one who acheives their goals . in this case , the russians achieved their goal , so they won . su had 300,000 casualties out of a standing army of 2 million and a fullest possible mobilised army of 10-30 million and finally a population of around 200 million . finland had 70,000 casualties and a standing army of 160,000 , with a fullest possible mobilised army of around maybe 300,000-400,000 and finally a total population of around 3 million . finland did n't keep their independence , they lost 11 % of it . finlands objective was to keep all their lands , otherwise they would just have given the soviets what they wanted . you could argue that the soviet union also lost because they did n't achieve their objectives . but that does n't mean finland won , just that both finland and the soviet union lost . it does n't matter that they did n't get 11-0 , football has rules for who wins and who loses and according to those rules , mu won . in the same way , the soviet union won the winter war , even if it was a pyrrhic victory . finland lost 11 % of its territory and 30 % of its economy ."
9xz7ag,"the saudi crown prince should be convicted for murder . now that the cia has concluded that the crown prince ordered khashoggi 's death , i think nato should order him to renounce his royalty status and hand himself over for a lifetime in jail . additionally , if saudi arabia does not comply , nato should threaten to take him down by force . i 'm aware that this method would risk many innocent lives , but the situation in saudi arabia is getting too dire . world leaders must be held personally responsible for their actions , and when their actions directly gets a journalist killed , they should be held responsible for murder and not let him get away with a slap on the wrist .","in the end of the day equal justice a lie sold to keep the people calm ; world leaders know damned well that if they started to prosecute certain powerful men that it would be more trouble than it would be worth . being the monarch of a country they have the authority to order the death of anyone so it is not possible for them to commit murder . i 've been aware of what saudi arabia is like for years ( they have a long history of human rights abuses , this is just one of the more public ones ) . but saudi arabia also plays a vital role in that region in relation to countries such as iraq , syria , etc . doing any of what you suggested would even further destabilise the entire region , and would ultimately do far more harm than good . hey i 'm gon na assume comfortable by your post you do n't actually know what nato does . nato in this case has 0 power they can openly condemn the action and that 's about it there will be no criminal trial several problems here : the prince might have the authority to order someone killed ( i do n't know , but that is a power typically available to upper leadership ) , the cia might feel comfortable asserting that he ordered the hit , but their evidence might not be good enough for a "" beyond a reasonable doubt "" standard of conviction , nato has no authority to order him to do anything , and even if they did , that would be a dreadful trespass of saudi sovereignty . "" taking him down by force "" in this case amounts to assassination , which is a much worse crime than simple murder . i mean , if its a saudi law that the prince broke , why should a foreign government investigate , judge and enforce the saudi law ? and if you think so , how come i do n't see you clamoring for the conviction and punishment of us presidents who have undoubtedly caused the deaths of far more people that the crown prince ? then , they could say if he ever enters turkey , or a place that has an extradition policy with them , that he should be sent to turkey for sentencing . however , this might provoke a war between turkey and saudi arabia , which probably would kill a lot more people than one . to me , the best course of action would be sanctioning ksa and canceling arms deals and aid to them . ostracize them , buy oil from someone else , form new alliances in the region , stop supporting the war in yemen . nato is just an alliance of nations in the north atlantic , which saudi arabia is not a part of , so nato has no authority here . in fact , no one in the international community has the authority to charge the crown prince with murder because international law does n't actually deal with such relatively minor crimes as murder , only with such massive tragedies as war crimes , or genocide , simple murder just is n't there . so turkey could charge the crown prince with murder and try him in absentia but the crown prince is n't in turkey and going to war over a single person , seems kinda counter intuitive . why should we kill a lot of people to arrest a single one ? even if he is the crown prince of a country trying to hold leaders of sovereign countries accountable for their actions will rapidly lead you into a world of hurt ."
9xyxob,"women who are addicted to drugs and are not actively seeking treatment should be given incentives ( monetary or legally ) to get on birth control or even to be sterilized . i want to start out by saying i believe addiction is a disease and i am sympathetic to those who struggle with addiction , as i know most drug users have experienced trauma in their life and drugs are the only way they know how to cope . i am also a moderate when it comes to politics , and i actually probably lean more to the left if i had to choose . however , i ’ve worked in the foster care system . i ’ve seen many women addicted to drugs give birth to 5 , 6 , in some cases 10 kids all being born addicted to drugs . many of these children go through withdrawal symptoms and have ongoing health issues . i ’ve seen some cases where the child does n’t end up making it . it is not fair for all these children to be brought into the world just to be put into foster care and/or struggle with health issues their whole life . i developed this view after learning about what a lady named barbra harris does for a living . she runs a non profit in alabama that offers money to women who are addicted to drugs to get on long term birth control or sterilized . vice did a story on her which you can watch here . “ this woman pays drug users not to have kids . ” vice tried to spin the story negatively , but honestly i thought what she was doing was great . now , i definitely do not think we should force every drug user to get sterilized . i do n’t think we should force anyone to do anything . if they say they do n’t want to even after being offered incentives , then that should be it . i think there should be more programs like the one barbra has , and maybe even more judges offering reduced sentences if drug users agree to get sterilized/long term birth control . change my view .","the length of the sentence should not be reduced for any reason other than a change in one of those categories while serving time ( ie good behaviour ) . if two drug offending women commit identical crimes and one does not want to be sterilised ( understandable , the side effects are n't great and many addicts want to or plan to get clean ) while the other does , and one of them gets a longer sentence for not being willing to undergo a surgical procedure or longterm course of medication , you 're punishing someone for not having surgery , which has nothing to do with the crime she committed . it should be no secret that drug enforcement in the usa ( both what drugs are illegal and who gets caught ) is at least somewhat tied to race . having sterilisation linked to a part of law enforcement we know has racial bias could therefore heighten tensions and spark potential ethnic cleansing . even if we ignore the racism , though , eugenics is still a problem , as putting compulsory/incentivised sterilisation into laws could lead to governments using sterilisation as a punishment . i 'm not certain why this is limited to just women forced drug tests ? those are both expensive and an invasion of privacy as many drug tests require someone to actually view the urination to prevent people from pretend urinating and replacing the urine . in the example of offering direct financial incentives , it 's preying on someone who you pretty much know is in an altered state of mind . if they 're not on drugs at the moment , then they 're working out how to get their next fix . if someone comes along and offers them a financial incentive to get a medical procedure , they are n't in a good state of mind to demonstrate informed consent or awareness of long term consequences . if you offer someone a 4 year sentence , or 3 years if they get sterilized , then in effect you 're sentencing them to a year in jail for refusing to be sterilized . as it stands , as a young women ( early twenties ) with no children there is 0 % chance any doctor would sterilize me ( with me being willing ) because i am ' too young ' and do n't have children . if we ca n't even get discounted birth control to normal people who want it for a reasonable price , and people who have the money and want to be sterilized are turned away because ' what if you change your mind !!?!!? do you think it 's moral to offer an unchangeable decision ( sterilization ) to a drug addicts in exchange of money ? which result would guaruantee that much less children being born to addicted people . which would include offering monetary incentivzes to addicts in exchange for any further medical assistance in the future . birth control should be free , which is a kind of financial incentive . putting another organization in a position to dangle incentives ( "" do this thing to your body and we 'll pay you "" ) allows a bureaucracy , however well-meaning , power over decisions that bureaucrats ( whether in government or philanthropy or religious institution ) should not have ."
9xyikp,"requiring voters to pass any kind of test before they vote is a bad idea so it seems like at least once a week on this subreddit , someone comes along and makes a post that x demographic of people should n't be allowed to vote . usually the reasoning boils down to x demographic of people are n't thinking logically , whether that be because they 're mentally ill , not sufficiently intelligent , or just ill-informed . and the op will usually propose that we implement some kind of test ( or sometimes just a full denial of the right to vote ) that a potential voter must pass in order to demonstrate some degree of political literacy before we allow them to cast their influence on the direction of public policy . every time i see this topic in my feed , i always side against the op . but there seem to be a not insignificant number of people who hold the opposite view to me . i can understand both sides of the issue . in my view , i want to protect the right of stupid people to vote because it means that my right to vote will always be protected . but on the flip side , it 's not hard to imagine how allowing literal insane people to vote could damage a democracy ; it 's not hard to imagine how allowing throngs of people who ca n't even name the 2 separate houses of congress to vote could be hijacked by a politician . i agree that voter illiteracy is a problem , but i just ca n't bring myself to agree that the solution to this problem is to force people to pass a test before they can vote . i 'll outline my problems with voter testing in 3 points : 1 ) the first and most obvious hurdle is deciding who gets to write the test . a bipartisan committee ? why do only 2 parties get to write it ? do the greens and the libertarians get a say , or is it only politicians who hold power ? an independent third-party think-tank ? you do n't get to police their politics , and who will be responsible for approving their test ? 2 ) i think the second biggest consideration is that you have to ask yourself , what will this test look like in 200 years ? if we allow this barrier to entry to be set , how will that evolve over time ? even if we were to start it as a very simple , straightforward , innocuous thing like just testing people on basic governmental structure as laid out in the u.s. constitution , how do we know that later someone wo n't use the existence of that test to justify writing a more stringent test on every other nuanced social policy issue ? nobody has time to become an expert on every facet of u.s. policy , and i do n't think they have to in order to have a functioning democratic society . people tend to vote on what 's important to them , and everyone brings their own perspective with them when they vote . if everyone is educated on just one or a couple social issues , then everyone is contributing their own perspective to the direction of our public policy , and i think that 's the intention of a democratic society . 3 ) a third issue you 're going to have is deciding who gets to grade the test , and what protections do you guarantee to ensure that your test will be judged fairly , and what recourse can you get if it 's not judged fairly ? to paraphrase joseph stalin , it does n't matter who votes , it matters who counts the votes and how . similarly , it may matter less who writes the test , and more who grades the test , and how they do so . this is probably the least obvious issue , but possibly the most easily exploitable . to change my view , you 'd have to explain to me how the 3 problems i outline can be evaded . for the second one in particular , i think you 'd need to show me the legal argument from the supreme court 's perspective . how can they rule to narrowly permit a specific kind of test that wo n't be exploitable later ?","basically candidate x gets to ask candidate y three of any policy questions they can think of and candidate y has to answer honestly so that their base knows what to answer in order to be able to vote and candidate x has the opportunity to ask the most divisive and "" gotcha-y "" questions possible to expose the True opinions of the candidate . voters would have to accurately answer all of the policy questions for both candidates . less so about any qualities of the voter and more about the voters level of information about a set of candidates . i think you should be an adult and a citizen , but that is n't a test per se . you 're starting from the presumption that democracy is a good thing and thus universal suffrage should be the best thing . not only does our constitution reflect that but the supreme court has repeatedly confirmed that poll tests are not unconstitutional if they are used in a non discriminatory manner . to pretend we do n't have a mechanism to strip citizens of their voting rights is absurd : most felons are n't permitted to vote , among other disenfranchised people . one is your poll test that could see whether a citizen plays an active roll in civic life and has a minimal understanding of how our government functions . you erect hurdles to keep the poor and ignorant from voting : require an id , put polling places away from public transit , schedule work on election day . as anyone who works in business will tell you , every obstacle filters people out ( in surprisingly high percentages too ) . throw in a couple forms you have to fill out , make them difficult to find and write them to a 10th grade reading level , and you 've basically disenfranchised the urban poor . thing is , you do n't link those forms to voting . the voter registration forms are super simple , so no one can complain . the form that gets you an id you can use at the voting place is the one you make impossible to navigate . in my state we even have separate classes of id , one that 's federally compliant and requires the same paperwork as a passport , the other that you basically tell them your name and they give you a photo id . not necessarily trying to change your view , but here ’s the logic i use : if you ’re considered sufficiently competent to be subject to the full force of the law , you ’re competent enough to vote . most of the posts do n't put much thought into how exactly the texts should work ( and i would think you havent either because of confirmation bias ) , therefore saying those tests would n't work is n't really fair . so if you believed that there should be a way to force voters to show that they are informed , there is probably a way to institute such a test . i have n't given it as much thought as such a thing needs , to solve some of the problems you mention : - any changes to the test need to be ratified by a 2/3 mayority referendum ( where everyone can vote even if they do n't pass the previous test ) . ps : there obviously woulf be problems with a system explained in a reddit comment , but the point of this post was to show that you can solve most problems with clever design . pps : there are obviously ethical problems with such a test , but this is a separate issue to the practicality , i was only trying to make arguments for the practicality of such a test . much like we do not allow children to vote , we should n't allow those who are just as , if not less mentally competent than children to vote . it does n't make sense to me why an illiterate , low intelligence ( or mentally disabled ) individual should have the same weight attached to their vote as a judge or a lawyer . i think that the simplest way of filtering out many of those who do not have the capacity to make informed or intelligent decisions is through a simple and objective test attached to voter registration . in the event such a test were implemented , i think that the easiest way of doing it would be to have the test written by academics such as teachers and professors before being validated as unbiased by high-level officials in the judicial branch of government , such as supreme court justices . what is one of the freedoms outlined in the first amendment to the united states constitution ? questions like these do not have a partisan bias and ensure that voters are familiar with government structure and the constitution . i do n't really think you would have to change the test , unless the subject of the test changed . you could even create legal restrictions on modifying the questions unless the government structure or constitution were modified beforehand . if we can trust people to fairly and accurately count votes in our elections , i reckon we can trust that same organization to fairly and accurately grade these tests . the problem with democracy i think is best summed up by socrates - "" people prefer the dentist over the candyman , whilst the dentist makes you better it is n't nice , but the candyman gives you candy which tastes nice even if it 's worse for you "" paraphrasing of course , huge swathes of the general public can be influenced by the candymen which can be seen a lot with socialism , hell even "" educated "" people i know have said stuff like "" britain 's economy depends on america using britain as a gateway to the eu "" , if you allow people like this to vote then lies and candymen get people into power , not actual competentsy . i do n't think their vote should be banned , but something needs to be done to curb the effect of the candymen . an elderly voter asked how to vote for the party of a candidate she liked . so the elderly voter did n't even know which party her favourite candidate was in . at this point , a small test about at least knowing which party is which might be useful ."
9xycly,"cmv : a middle ground between consequentialism and its opposite is a better ethical stance than the two by themselves . ( reposting this since yesterday it got deleted before someone could answer ) consequentialism : the doctrine that the morality of an action is to be judged solely by its consequences . while consequentialism 's opposite does n't really have a proper name as far as i know , it 's simply the definition reversed : the morality of an action is judged solely by the action itself . so , for example , murder is immoral and therefore it is always immoral , without taking into consideration the context or what this causes . l i will refer to this doctrine as "" actionism "" to simplify ( and because i could n't come up with a better name ) . so a pure consequentialist would agree on the following claim : "" it is moral to murder and harvest the organs of 99 people to save 100 sick people .

) i do n't fully understand all the differences but suffice to say , term limits serve as a much-needed check on power in the current system of the us . other aspects of the system would have to change fundamentally in order to make term limits unnecessary . the reason given in the article above is that people dislike congress as a whole but like their particular congressperson because they get pork barrel spending for their district - basically favors and benefits that only support the people there . but the lawmaking process becomes a series of trading favors and political bribes to keep each congressperson re-elected , rather than making good policy for the country as a whole . incumbents have disproportionate advantages in elections because they have name recognition , and essentially bribe their constituents to keep them in power . i argue that this is a subversion of the democratic election process where the incumbent manipulates voters into supporting them to distract them from the actual issues , like making good policy and representing their interests beyond pork barrel spending on a federal level . i will give you a scenario where term limits are actually beneficial to democracy ... say a person with millions of dollars decided they wanted to become president for life . let ’s say that multi-millionaire decided to do so all he had to do is bribe key people during every election and subvert the course of democracy . if this was hidden from the public at least damage would be limited to two terms instead of their natural lifespan . if everyone collectively decides to implement term limits , then that 's part of democracy . when you get into power you can orchestrate illegal activities to stay in power . term limits help prevent too much consolidation of power and reinforce the norm of peaceful transition of power . if we look at the level of corruption in russian politics , it 's rooted in the fact that putin has an interest in preserving his political dynasty in a way that would be impossible in a country with term limits . a benefit of term limits is that no amount of assassination or election rigging can secure a corrupt president a third term . fdr shows a fundamental issue with a lack of term limits . fdr 's big campaign when pursuing yet another term was that you should n't change horses midstream . term limits stop incumbency advantage from having too massive an impact , which is good , because incumbency advantage has little to do with how good a candidate actually is . many positions of power in the government are appointed by the president . article ii , section 2 , clause 2 grants the president the power to “ appoint ambassadors , other public ministers and consuls , judges of the supreme court , and all other officers of the united states [ except those whose positions are not otherwise already provided for in the constitution , and ] congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers … in the president alone . ” in other words , the president is given broad appointing powers , and the powers not granted the president , which remain with congress , may be vested in the president by congressional act . the longer a president stays in power , the more appointments they will make ( over time , people quit , retire , die , etc. ) . appointments are a good way for the president to consolidate his power ; the appointee will usually use the influence they have to maintain the president in office . term limits are important because the longer a person stays in power , the more appointees he will have supporting him , which means the more of an unfair advantage he will have . from the beginning , term limits have been a central tenet of democracies : the term ostracism comes from a athenian word which meant something alone the lines of exile ( obviously ) . the context of the word was that important people who were possibly gathering too much power ( for example , by staying in a political office for a very long time ) were voted to be more or less honorably exiled from the city-state for a decade as a safeguard against tyranny . the american founding fathers had similar fears against tyranny - they helped fight a war against it , after all - and so took great pains in writing the founding documents to ensure foreign and domestic powers could never gain too much influence and authority . you could have a very well-loved ( or very smart ) president stay in office for many terms , then take means to ensure their offspring would also have the office , and so forth . it could be argued that term limits prevent the people from voting for who they want , but democracy is always a compromise , and safeguards against authoritarianism is worth it .

9xvljt,"if women are allowed to undergo abortion , then men should be allowed to choose not to support children if a woman is not pregnant due to rape and is not in danger of dying due to being pregnant then she should not be allowed to get an abortion . if she is , then men should be given the option not to pay child support . the woman in this scenario knew full well what the consequences of having unprotected sex is . if she did n't want the baby then she should n't have had sex in the first place . why should a woman be allowed to opt out of parenthood , while a man is n't ? & #x200b ; & #x200b ; this statement assumes the following : \ - the women had consensual sex , and \ - giving birth/carrying the baby to term is not detrimental to the woman 's health . in the case that the stated assumptions are not True for a scenario , then my opinions would obviously change . however , for this discussion please assume that they are True for the scenario .","as for the man opting out of child support , i would agree theoratically . if a women should be able to opt out of having to care/pay for a child , so should the dad . women who undergo abortion have to make a hard decision , they undergo something that will emotionally trouble them . a man opting out of paying child support should n't be as easy as a woman opting out of bearing a child for these obvious reasons . yet , given your argument with abortion , if a man does n't want to pay child support , he should n't have sex . if men could get pregnant like sea horses , sure , they should have the right to an abortion . it is just a part of being pregnant that women accept . a woman has a lot lower risk of developing health issues if she is never pregnant . child support is for the benefit of the child . at this point , the child can be handed off to another human being . so while people want to link abortion and child support , it is n’t really right to do so . child support is for the benefit of the child , not just for the mother . when a father has sole custody the mother may be forced to pay child support to him . while i agree with you in the sense that the woman 's sole right to decide to carry to term creates an asymmetrical power situation vis-a-vis the future of the man ( whether he will have a child , with all its potential benefits and burdens ) , failing to support a child that you have helped to create violates an even more important principle . that principle is that the good of society is best served by investing in the future of society , the children . a child is a separate human being , blameless in its origin , that was called into existance by the actiions of two people . that child , and society as a whole , is best served by providing the child with the best possible chance of becoming a healthy , productive member of society . society has chosen the well being of children over the well being of adults . the reason for this is that if this principle is not adopted , the wellbeing of society as a whole suffers , and the other options are seen as either morally bankrupt , unfairly burdensome to other members of society ( taxation ) , or otherwise damaging to society . what is to stop the father from changing his mind very late , once the mother is already very invested and emotionally attached to the pregnancy ? both men and women have advantages and disadvantages in the mating game . women are unfairly burdened by the biological process and that leads to what people misconsTrue as the "" gender pay gap "" . men are unfairly burdened unequal custody of children in a divorce and shouldering a large margin of the child support . like you said men also have an uneven say in abortion decisions . i do n't know if those are problems that need to be solved or just the consequences of biological differences between men and women . however , once a child is brought into the world , having a deadbeat dad is one of the fastest ways to damage that childs future prospects . so you are using the argument that the woman knew the consequences of unprotected sex and should have used protection or abstained . your assuming responsibility and contraception is solely up to the woman to initiate . a man knows full well the consequences of unprotected sex and if he did n't want a baby he should have put on a condom . i 'm a male and i do n't want a kid so i put a condom on . if you do n't wan na pay child support , or deal with abortion decisions use contraceptives or do n't have sex . referring to abortion as opting out of parenthood is not accurate ."
9xto6w,"the term "" mansplaining "" is overtly sexist . this argument is stupid and does n't hold water , primarily because it 's used to deflect an argument by way of making it a gendered issue . and to me , that 's sexist and dismissive of any type of dissent . if a male or female makes a valid point regarding the discussion at hand that rubs the other the wrong way , reducing an argument to gender because one does n't want to continue talking is sexist and cowardly ; and the sword slices both ways . the dismissal of women 's thoughts and opinions based solely on the fact that they 're women is just as harmful and stupid . if you are in a discussion and you do n't agree , just say you disagree . if you do n't want to continue talking about it , say you do n't want to continue talking about it . it 's not guaranteed to go your way , but stand your ground and move on without assigning "" gender roles "" to opinions solely because of the gender of the other person . that aside , are n't status-quo "" gender roles "" a concept that many people are trying to move away from , yet allow terms like "" mansplaining "" to continue ? seems to be playing into the patriarchy by relying on old and outdated gender role . asking for a friend . gender should not be a means of disapproval for opposing views , nor should it be a shield for one 's opinion or presentation of facts .","however , people without any experience in a subject tend to speak accurate claims less often than those who do . when women voice their personal experience of discrimination day-to-day , and a guy dismisses it because he does n't see that kind of discrimination , he is speaking outside of his expertise . the term is meant to highlight a common problem that women face , especially professionals and experts , who have obviously less-experienced men speak condescendingly to them by explaining things that the woman knows so much more about . i agree when the term is used to dismiss an argument or counter argument by virtue of the persons gender , it ’s sexist , but the term it ’s self is n’t . when the term “ mansplaining ” is used correctly , it refers to a scenario which is already gendered/sexist : a man , based on his patriarchal & False assumptions about what a woman does or should know , takes a condescending tone to explain something to said woman . furthermore , if someone is truly “ mansplaining , ” then the view the man is sharing is something the woman already knows , so pointing out his bias/condescension does n’t prevent meaningful dialogue from taking place . in the same way , men might brush off the “ nagging ” wife or girlfriend ( which i would assert is a similarly gendered term , in its common usage ) . the term as coined is by design overtly sexist so as to jarringly highlight an immediately preceding instance of unwarranted male-to-female condescension ( which had been the quietly endured norm for quite some time ) . sure , accusations of mansplaining can be and often are used to silence and dismiss a male voice in a conversation instead of addressing his points . when that happens , it is as you said ; a stupid way of silencing someone 's voice by making an issue gendered . i do n't think anyone who regularly interacts with women on a friendly basis would deny that mansplaining happens ; women in pretty much any professional setting probably have at least one story where a man with lesser or equal expertise to their own tried to explain something that definitely did n't need to be explained to them . well , in the broadest definition of the term , yes , because it inherently addresses sex . but you ca n't address a behavior that is itself sexist without straying into that territory ; it 's rhetorically impossible . what you imply by asserting the term is sexist , though , is that it is needlessly bringing sex/gender into a situation where it does n't or should n't matter . i think the argument against that is that in the cases when the accusation is True ( in that the man who is "" mansplaining "" would n't be doing so if the person he is explaining to was not a woman ) , it 's not needlessly sexist because the mansplainer made it sexist himself . so to tl ; dr : shielding yourself from valid , earnest criticism by claiming mansplaining = dumb and not acceptable . telling someone who is legitimately mansplaining to stop mansplaining = not dumb , not sexist . mansplaining does happen , and while there are people who use that dishonestly to give themselves a rhetorical advantage , that does take away from the fact that some accusations of mansplaining are valid and legitimate . when someone feels that they are being mansplained to , the feeling is less ‘ he does n’t think i understand the topic ’ and more ‘ he does n’t think i understand the topic because i ’m a woman ’ ."

9xm8ik,"selectively breeding animals with genetic defects should be illegal this post is prompted by this one , which shows a baby albino turtle born with an open heart cavity . turns out it is the product of extensive selective albino inbreeding by these assholes . albinism is heavily correlated with birth defects , health issues , and drastically shorter lifespans . i see no reason why this should be legal , and i think this should extend to the breeding of dogs that have respiratory and other issues because we think they ’re cute . creating new breeds and varieties of animals that are born to suffer (","from an evolutionary standpoint , there is no such thing as a genetic defect , unless it kills the animal outright . but for science , these mice and rats have saved countless human lives , and advanced humanities understanding of cancer considerably . if you want a snub nosed , small , round dog like a pug , you can breed for that , and there are reasons to do so ( like rodent hunting , or simply the desire to have one ) that may be worth the costs of amplifying unwanted traits like difficulty breathing or skin issues . as time goes on , you can also breed out unwanted traits , too . and on top of that , breeding can lead to unknown or surprising outcomes , like russia 's fox breeding program , which along with domesticating silver foxes , showed that hair color , body shape and behavior are all interlinked , and now the foxes look and act like dogs . there are moral facts that all humans are binded by . one of these moral facts is causing suffering to conscious beings with qualia is immoral . animals are conscious beings with their own qualia and subjective experience of reality . if any of these fail then humans have a moral liberty to do whatsoever they please with animals , assuming we do n't restrict them from doing it ( which we certainly can do , but we would not doing so due to a fact but rather we would just be imposing our opinions ) . if , however , you think it is a moral fact that harming animals is wrong then you have a lot of work ahead to demonstrate it . while i agree it is ( in most cases ) morally wrong to breed traits that will cause the animal suffering , making it illegal is not feasible without completely outlawing breeding . i agree that for-profit breeding of animals with defects such as that is sad and morally wrong . obviously a turtle with an opening to the heart is bad , but what about animals that are bred to have more meat ? many of the traits we breed into animals could be considered "" defects "" because they are n't for the benefit of the animal . i do n't think those breeders meant to make a turtle with an open heart cavity . they were just trying to make albinos because they thought it was cool . while it is True that albinism is associated with other defects , it by itself is not necessarily more detrimental than many of the changes we 've made to certain dog breeds . furthermore , other defects can happen totally by accident , just from chance mutations . the problem with this stance is that it is somewhat hypocritical , why is it okay for us to genetically breed clones of lab mice but not okay when we do the same with dogs for cuteness ? the whole point of medical research is solely to benefit humans , as such , why is it so morally wrong to play around with dog breeding for the sake of producing companions to benefit humans ? - weirdo dog breeding has made some really disturbing traits in dogs and cats . other than some possible hindrance in vision and a higher risk of skin cancer ( for animals that spend lots of time in the sun or some other source of uv light ) , it 's not particularly harmful to the animal . it even becomes an adaptive trait for an animal that lives in a cave . more importantly , however , it may be associated with other generic issues but it does n't cause them . literally everything we selectively breed for could be considered a genetic defects . i would actually argue a broader claim than yours , that breeding itself is unethical and can constitute animal abuse . i ’d usually agree wholeheartedly but as an owner of the most awesome , loving , spinx cat i could n’t imagine living without him ( my first cat spinx had a congenial heart defect ) , but alas he ’s a by - product of this exact treatment . the thought that so many cats died leading up to my perfect little family member makes me think , but in the end it was worth it to me and i spoil the hell out of my sphinx so i ’d like to think he sees it that way as well . breeding animals that are correlated with birth defects and health issues is not the same as breeding animals with those birth defects/health issues . the fact of the matter is that albinism is merely a recessive genetic mutation affecting a particular allele . for any given species , there may be multiple lines of albino animals . some of those albino strains may be compatible with one another , and others may be completely incompatible with one another . if you breed two incompatible albino animals together , all their babies will be visually normal , but they will be heterozygous ( i.e. , carrying the gene ) for both strains of albino . the reason i mention this all is to show that not all albinos ( or other genetic mutations ) are the same , even if they come from the same clutch . so if you have two compatible albino animals that breed together , the resulting clutch will be 100 % visually albino . however , this only addresses that single allele on which the albino gene is located . the other alleles , which may affect a swath of different things like pattern , size , color , health , etc. , are completely independent . so even if you start with the premise that albinism has a higher correlation of health defects , you have to still recognize that some albino animals will be genetically stronger than others . even breeding two seemingly normal , non-albino , healthy animals together may lead to unhealthy babies as a result of random genetic mutation . however , what we have learned is that some traits that we believed led to nonviable animals actually have various strains , some of which end up being viable . take for instance platinum reticulated pythons . this is a co-dominant gene ( which means that the heterozygous animal visually displays the gene , but the homozygous animal visually displays something entirely different ) . when platinum retics were first discovered , breeders had no idea what breeding them together would produce , whether their offspring would be viable , etc . without getting too into the specifics , they found out that the homozygous animal ( there are multiple lines , but for simplicity we 'll call one leucistic ) was a viable , visually white snake . it was n't until the next line of breeding leucistics to eachother that they discovered that this third line of offspring was not viable . so if breeding animals together that produce unhealthy offspring is illegal , should that person be responsible , even though they had no knowledge that it would lead to nonviable animals ? continuing with the platinum example , and merging it with the albino example , we discovered that there were multiple lines of platinum . a second line , which is visually the same as the original , produced leucistic animals whose offspring are healthy and viable . this breeding would have never occurred , and this discovery never made , had they been precluded from breeding the animals entirely . going back to the nuance i pointed out at the beginning of my post , at least in the reptile world , when breeders discover a genetic defect ( i.e. , spinal kinks ) , those affected animals are specifically not bred again in order to hopefully remove that genetic issue from future generations . visually healthy animals are bred together , and any genetically deformed animals are removed as breeders from that clutch , and so on . it 's through this process that viable lines are discovered , and genetic defects weeded out . that albino turtle with an open heart cavity , even if it were to survive to adulthood , would never be bred . and furthermore , we currently simply have no way of knowing whether the health issue it faced was due to random mutation , something inherently wrong with that line of albinism , a result of inbreeding , or an issue during incubation that led to improper development of the embryo . the last possibility is especially common in reptiles , and i suspect it is the True cause of that turtle 's heart defect . one other nuance worth mentioning is that much of the health issues that result from selective breeding are not a result of the morph ( e.g. , albinism ) itself , but rather are a result of inbreeding . however , reputable breeders specifically work to diversify their breeding programs by outcrossing their breeding lines with new blood in order to diversify the gene pool of their animals . breeding programs for some endangered species ( e.g. , the eastern indigo snake ) face this problem because breeders are not allowed to collect wild specimens to bring genetic diversity into their breeding pool . as a result , many of the animals are born with spinal kinks and other health issues . i 'm fine with outlawing breeding animals with known defects . but outlawing breeding animals with traits that merely are correlated with defects , when breeding itself prone to random chance , is going to be extremely hard to enforce due to inability to prove the True issue , and it 's going to prevent necessary , helpful discoveries ( like viable lines ) that would not otherwise occur with that law in place . dogs are bred to be ' pure ' for shows , but the more ' pure ' it is the more likely they are to have certain genetic defects . dalmatians , german shepherds , bichon fricassee , those are all dogs that can be certified to be ' pure ' bred dogs . things like spots on the tongue or roof of the mouth can be a disqualifier . these health issues are why police are moving away from german shepherds and going to a different dog . if you were to illegalize selective breeding , you would illegalize the process that pushed innovation made to societal development over thousands of years we get enough milk to supply our lifestyle with fewer cows ( and lower costs ) because of selective breeding , hunting dogs are bred to accomplish their tasks ; artificial selection has enabled mankind to produce better , stronger , or otherwise more beneficial animals to supplement our lifestyle . idiots trying to produce profitable animals with disgusting deformities aside , the method is tried and tested over thousands of years to produce animals that are of massive benefit to mankind . overall , despite the moral failings of some corporations , artificial selection is a powerful tool that allows us to shape our world and criminalizing it will do more harm than good . we mostly try very hard to breed fish in captivity so that wild fish get to stay in the wild . but to do so we have to breed colorful fish with extravagant fins that some may see as a defect . we knew nothing about the many health issues that a lot of purebreds face until speaking with our vet . it would effectively mean that using any animal that is commercially produced for food at this point illegal because they 've all been subject to this sort of harmful breeding . would you continue to hold this opinion if it meant that it was illegal to keep breeding the same animals that make it possible to eat affordable animal products ? on the other hand these dogs are invaluable in a rural ranch lifestyle . you can apply this logic to almost any animal we have selectively bred . yes , your terrier will help keep varmint populations down , but he will also be predisposed to chasing cats and other critters you would rather he left alone . legally speaking , in common law , there ’s no difference between a turtle and a car - both are just things you own . and because we are both pet owners and meat eaters , it ’s surprisingly difficult to come up with a law that protects , say , a dog from abuse , that does n’t also interfere with the ability to slaughter a cow . as a practical matter , it ’s virtually impossible to write a law to prevent something like this , except to make bulky case by case exceptions . obviously , it would be abusive to make an entire breed of turtles with exposed hearts , but how can you punish someone raising otherwise healthy albino turtles ? this law would be impossible to pass and even harder to enforce as all animals have genetic defects . selective breeding is how we have every type of domestic animals , hence they are now domestics . additionally , saying you should n't breed those knowing there could be a bad outcome also would n't be beneficial for several reasons . it happen unintentionally , and someone easily could be persecuted for an unknown bad trait or accidental breeding . some lineages of dog breeds just have some bad traits . plus , pugs and other squish snouted breeds have respritory issues because of their squish snouted noses . lab animals such as rats are bred to have diabetes and other issues to test the drugs that are being created to test of humans . i know people are like "" aww poor lab animals , "" but the reality is either we test on well treated lab animals , or we directly test on humans , which would go really really badly . know or unknown ( some people do n't know until their 30s ) and their kids now have an autoimmune disease . some people enjoy it , you being against selective breeding that results in physical defects is n’t a reason to make it illegal . if we discontinued breeding dogs with "" defects "" then their value will go down to us therefore threatening their species . violators pay a fine that covers the cost of the oversight with the remainder going to animal shelters and advocacy . there 's an interesting hypothesis that the mutated genes that caused jaw muscles become weaker has lead the way for humans to become smarter . any animals that has strong jaw muscles requires a strong bony ridge to attach to . weaker jaw muscles caused them to prefer cooked food ( which led us to find ways to spark a fire when desired ) . which is an animal ... many humans breed even when they have genetic defects . in our context , those who find certain varieties of human superior , think those other forms have genetic defects ... thus eugenics is also the presence of laws preventing defect based breeding ( all of this is on a philosophical level just in case you take offense ) yet we pretty much agree eugenics is bad . it was bred for specific traits , some of them come with defects . love them as a breed , great dogs . but they ’ve also got short life spans and loads of common health issues . right now , you have at least one half of a gene that , if activated in your children , would lead to disastrous results . if you have a kid with someone , they also put in that kid 's genetic code at least half of at least one disease that you would never want to have . if you want to ban selectively breeding based on this , you 'd have to ban all breeding in general . if you really are open to changing your view , consider this : what constitutes a "" genetic defect "" is highly subjective . however , often the "" jobs "" that are required of dogs now are to be dogs that fit into our lives , no matter what those are . as a quick aside , many people are against breeding of dogs because we have a lot of dogs in shelters ( at least in the us - this varies by country , and varies by where you are in the us due to cultural norms , weather , etc. ) . but generally , in my experience , most dogs end up in shelters because they were not "" fitting "" into whatever household they were in . now , sometimes this is because the people who got dogs were absolute idiots and would n't have the ability to care for any dog ( assuming dogs do n't need training or exercise , etc. ) but it 's often because they got the wrong dog for them and can not meet their needs because they underestimated the time needed to take care of the dog with the time they need to take care of their children . i know this family would have been fine with a more mellow breed like a havanese , or a pug , or a great dane or any breeds that need less exercise than an energetic lab . if we did n't have those breeds , i could n't help out anyone by suggesting the types of dogs to look for so they could get a dog that actually fits into their family . i would n't suggest a pekinese for a super active family that goes hiking every day , and i would n't suggest a jack russel terrier to someone who has a lot of hamsters . but the reality is , in order to have that variety of dog , you need inbreeding to make breeding True . now there are some breeds that have significant health issues that really need to be addressed ( heart issues in dobermans and cavaliers , breathing issues in some of the bracheaphallic dogs , etc. ) but that does n't call for a stop of breeding - that calls for better breeding . the issue is , that cuts down a lot on the gene pool . if you have a corgi that is otherwise a great example of the breed , has no other heath issues , but is a carrier of dm , if you were to remove them from the gene pool , it would be a significant issue . but if you were to breed them to a dog that is clear of dm , puppies would n't have dm ( you need two parents that are carriers of dm to get dm ) , and you also would n't have lessened the gene pool ( potentially creating even more genetic issues ) . but if we can instead work to incentivize good breeding , without being too limiting ( for example in the corgi issue ) , it should n't be an issue . hey there , o was a vet tech for a while and can tell you that there are lots of breeds that have health issues due to the way we ’ve selectively bred them . pugs , frenchies , boston terriers and other brachycephalic breeds are huge victims of overbreeding leading to poor health traits . the faces of pugs have been made flatter and more squished because it ’s deemed to be very cute , but this makes it harder to breathe for them ( and also harder for them to survive under anesthesia , there are different fasting protocols for intubation for these breeds ) . greyhound osteosarcomas are really common due to their selective breeding for a streamlined body and long , thin legs . boxers and golden retrievers in my experience are gigantic cancer factories due to how we ’ve bred them . my wife and i operate a rescue for double merle dogs , and a byproduct of the intentional breeding of this coloration is a 25 % chance of a puppy being blind or deaf . as such , in the year we 've been operating , we 've successfully taken in and eventually rehomed just shy of 30 dogs . one of the things we 've talked about is exactly this : coming up with legal ways of limiting the breeding of certain animals . good dog breeders know not to mix merle dogs together ( how you produce double merles ) , but because they 're such beautiful dogs , others are willing to ignore the risks and do it anyway . what we 've found is that many of the breeders we 've talked to ( cardi/pem welsh corgi , great dane , america/australian shepherd , pug ) are actively looking to breed out the mistakes that have been created over the past century . breeders ( backyard or otherwise ) who produce a litter of puppies without a license should be heavily fined , to the point that they are financially disincentivized from breeding again ( even in the case of desirable designer dogs like golden doodles ) . what was a well meaning law is going to have disasterous consequences on the dog population problem in shelters country wide , and on top of that , every racing team that actually did care for their dogs is going to lose out on their beloved companions ."
9xm48d,"nuclear deterrence is bullshit . deterrence only work if you are actually ready to make use of the weapon . i do n't see a single scenario where the use of this weapon is justified . and it does n't even prevent non nuclear power from attacking nuclear power as proved by the falklands war . they are the most expensive weapon system and you ca n't use it without committing a war crime / crime against humanity . i just do n't get it , why not stop funding these programs immediately ? what is the leverage you gain from having a nuke in your arsenal ?","japan was clearly unwilling to surrender , so the alternative to dropping the nuke would be an american land invasion which would result in millions of deaths ( both us and japan ... and a lot of japanese civilians ) . deterrence is necessary as long as at least one country has nukes , because then they have the biggest stick and could use it while not fearing total destruction . we only briefly had a scenario in which only one power har nuclear weapons and the results were disastrous . looking at the vast majority of human history , there is no reason to believe that a sole power would n't abuse that leverage . thus , all of the other powers are forced to nuclearize in order to have the threat of retaliation . deterrence requires states to be willing to use nuclear weapons , but nuclear weapons use is in fact irrational in most cases . if the russians launch thousands of nuclear weapons at the united states , it does n't make sense for the us to retaliate because we 're going to be dead anyways . likewise , if russia were to attack europe with nukes , it does n't make sense for the us to retaliate against russia because that just means the us will get involved in a nuclear war ( also known as the proverbial "" trading new york for paris "" dilemma ) . it 's basically a game of chicken where neither side wants to use nuclear weapons , but they 're willing to risk nuclear war to achieve their objectives . it is this increasing risk of nuclear war that allows deterrence to work . it 's not that there 's a clear point where states want to use nuclear weapons , but that crises could result in things escalating out of control . that 's how nuclear deterrence works - it 's a game of chicken with the most powerful weapons on earth . for smaller nuclear powers like the uk , france , pakistan , israel , or north korea , having nukes keeps superpowers from attacking you . i think you 're viewing the u.s. nuclear weapons posture through a dated lens , though the trump administration is currently trending in that direction as well . the first , which you seem to be thinking of , is counter-value targeting -- i.e. the threatening of cities and industry . the other is counter-forces targeting -- the threatening of other nuclear weapons . it still includes counter-value targeting , but these focus on industry , not population . it hopes to destroy 50 % of the adversary 's industry , including much of its army , and as much of its nuclear forces as possible . that is to say , it is to prevent the adversary from following up a nuclear attack with a conventional one . the goal is to make it so they 'd have nothing to gain from a nuclear attack . the obama nuclear policy was one of "" no intentional targeting of cities . "" the entire goal was to target the adversary 's nuclear and military capabilities . there are dangers with this strategy -- for example , if you are able to completely destroy the adversary 's nuclear forces in a single strike , you will be tempted to launch a first strike and they 'd be tempted to fire them all for fear of losing it . the eventual goal is to have a flexible array of nuclear options -- low-yield weapons to be used against military bases and high-yield weapons to be used in counter-value targeting . some countries ( china and india ) have a no first use policy and will only respond to a nuclear strike . france 's policy is to use them if its nuclear forces are targeted . if you use a nuclear weapon on the u.s. , the u.s. will destroy your nuclear capabilities and as much of your conventional capabilities as possible to prevent you from following up that strike . the use of nuclear weapons would never reasonably be justifiable - but you ’re relying on governments having any requirement to “ justify ” their actions . this requirement does n’t actually exist , and m.a.d. is a real concern simply because nuclear weapons exist ; you can not account for every variable in the future of humanity in any terms , so how can you rule out that a scenario whereby someone willing to use them ( justified or not ) gets access to one . predators hunt prey animals that are not likely to retaliate . buffalo are big , strong , and fierce . they will fight a lion if forced to , but do n't do so otherwise . few ... they are more often old , small , perceived to be weak , etc . however , that advantage is matched by others who also possess them . cyber warfare/drones are a current source of advantage that is being used in war ... until the next innovation . one small thing here : deterrence only works if your opponent believes you are actually ready to make use of the weapon . i can be unwilling to launch a nuclear counter attack , but still threaten to do so if i think that viable threat will prevent you from attacking me with nuclear weapons . for example , if you look at the letters of last resort that prime ministers give to the commanding officers of nuclear submarines with orders on what to do if the uk is nuked and they can not recieve new orders . nobody knows what is in the letter , as they are only to be opened if the prime minister passes after the uk is nuked , but they can simply say "" do not retaliate , the loss of life has already been to severe . "" but , publicly announcing the action will be "" nuke back "" means that is the behavior the other side has to anticipate , regardless of what is actually in the envelope . the falklands war did n't prove that nuclear weapons are not a deterrent - argentina knew that britain would not use nuclear weapons against them . the only exception i can think of is israel , which could end up facing overwhelming conventional forces from opposing countries , so nuclear capability keeps those conventional forces at bay . the opposing side only has to believe you will use them in a counterattack , war crime or not . two countries both having nukes does n't necessarily deter them from fighting each other but it does deter them from crossing the line to using nukes , knowing that they would be used on you in return . it also deters countries without nukes from invading countries with nukes , for the same reason , you may be able to invade and take over the country but that country has nukes outside of it 's borders that it will use as a last ditch hail mary . if you were the only one to have it , there would be plenty of scenario to use it , as you 'd be able to win virtually any war , and as such , for example you could say "" it will do damages , but we 'll bring the whole world together and therefore there will be no wars after this one "" . if you are loosing a big war , you can still use nukes to flatten both countries and therefore be in a "" no winner "" situation . implying that people using nukes actually care about war crimes at that point . you are right in that they do n't do anything to deter proxy wars or small skirmishes , because nuclear weapons would n't be justified then . in fact using them would be unsafe as other countries that are n't involved might get involved and even fire nukes at the initiating country . not a single country with nuclear weapons has ever been invaded . there has been no world war since the presence of nuclear weapons . we are north of 70 years now since nuclear weapons were invented , that is a pretty solid amount of time to gauge there impact . consider however the idea of deterrence may not require your being ready to use it . once you use the weapon , it ’s presumed the issue of deterrence has already failed ( you are using it in response to something after all ) nuclear weapons are bullshit , but deterrence may be more nuanced than suggested them having nukes basically stopped arab nations invading them every 10-15 years . it can be argued that just being in the posession of nuclear weapons . about the falklands war , yeah , here , the fact that the uk had a nuclear weapon was n't enough to deter argentina . but how many more examples of wars on a nuclear power 's territory despite the possession of nuclear weapons can you find ? also , it 's harder to find examples of wars not happening because of the possession of nuclear weapons . if any arab states decided to redo the six-day war , isreal would nuke them to smitters . there 's a difference between a skirmish like the falklands and a full blown-out war where countries fight until one is on the brink of collapse and surrenders ."
9xldm9,"it is wrong to ignore street smarts in favor of being pc this post will probably have more to do with classism than anything . if you are driving and you see someone who looks impoverished ( old/tattered clothes , unshowered , unshaven , etc ) it ’s not wrong to lock your doors . likewise it is n’t wrong to cross the street to avoid them . i do this regardless of race . due to our racial history in the us , it just so happens that minorities are more likely to fall into the poverty class than others . someone who is poor is more desperate and more likely to commit a crime/rob you , as unfortunate as it is . as a woman , i ’m also more likely to be weary of men in scenarios like these as they can overpower me . some may call this sexism ? i think personal safety takes priority over being politically correct and in scenarios where you have to make quick decisions , relying on certain stereotypes is crucial to survival , that ’s why our brains developed the ability to form stereotypes . i do n’t think we should take stereotypes as fact and look at people from a certain group as all having this one specific trait , but when your safety is concerned it is not a bad survival tool . the only scenario where i do n’t think this is okay is police officers . i do n’t think they should be relying on gut instincts when deadly weapons are involved and should be trained to assess situations and deescalate them without resorting to violence . i think scenarios like trayvon martin fall under this category as well . citizens should n’t be playing cop based on their gut instincts ( or really , ever ) . biases in scenarios where the person is currently innocent are not okay when threat of injury/death to them is involved . when acting on these biases does not hurt them ( ie locking your car door ) i think that is okay . it is wrong to actively go out of your way to harm someone based on a stereotype ( citizen arresting , calling 911 on someone just walking , attacking them , etc ) , but passively avoiding them is not only right but a good idea . since moving to a city , i ’ve had to rely on my instincts more and it has saved me on numerous occasions . that homeless person i tried to avoid would end up catcalling me after i crossed the street/try to follow me/etc . i ’ve had many scary situations arise since being here and ca n’t imagine trying to be pc while they were going on . i never knew how bad it really was since i ’m from a smaller town , but how frequently this occurs to me really saddens me . i do n’t think i ’ve had a single night walking where at least one person ( usually poor ) has n’t tried to harass me . i ’ll take being rude and non-pc over possible murder any day .","i totally hear you that walking around nyc as a woman can be terrifying ; i have firsthand experience with this . however , i ’m confused about why you ’d cross the street just because you were worried that someone would catcall you . and as you ’ve discovered , they ’re usually hell bent on saying whatever gross thing they want to say no matter what , and crossing the street wo n’t stop it . personally , i ’m wary of unnecessarily engaging in behaviors that make me look like prey . so i ’d only cross the street if i had a really bad feeling about someone or perceived a greater threat ( e.g. , i ’ll always avoid a group of rowdy , intoxicated men ) . you ’re signaling “ i ’m vulnerable ” to a lot of people ( some of whom might be an actual danger to you ) by taking these sort of actions to avoid a rude comment . therefore , by the actual definition of political correctness , there is no conflict between being "" street smart "" and being pc . the generally used negative definition of pc - that there are some things that are n't okay to do because they are based on being racist , sexist , etc. - still requires that the actor have some sort of social or political power . the concept of "" institutional racism , "" for example , applies to police and other people in positions of authority , but really does n't apply to a random citizen on the street because they do n't have any special authority . your example of how you should n't do a citizen arrest or call 911 on someone is exactly a version of an exercise of power that would make pc concerns applicable . the thing is , street smarts is n’t really at odds with being pc . lock the doors when you start driving , not when you see “ sketchy people ” - many cars these days seem to lock automatically when you start driving so this is n’t really a huge issue . do n’t listen to music , make eye contact with the people you pass so they know you ’ve seen them , walk with purpose , and project a sense that you ’re aware of your surroundings . it does n’t matter where you are , these will always serve you well . these are “ pc ” ( aka appropriate , non discriminatory ) behaviors that are also street smart . the reality is , the vast vast majority of people have 0 interest in you as you pass on the street . you should always be aware of your surroundings and make yourself as difficult a target as is reasonably possible , regardless of what the strangers around you look like . well the gut instinct a police officer has is the same one you have . the only action you can take is to passively avoid someone or lock your doors . the problem with street smarts is that it is n't really based on anything "" smart "" . you ca n't point to a real reason for locking your doors , and if it 's for "" safety "" then it would n't apply to your descriptions . whether or not it 's racist , or income based or appearance based is profiling . also , minorities happen to be more poor not because they 're a minority but because the areas they live in where made poor on purpose . lastly , and to your credit , your instinct for survival is n't wrong but it is n't necessarily smart . what 's truly smart is being suspicious of everyone and learning to tell the difference between someone who wants to do you harm , either mentally or physically , and acting accordingly . concluding , i think the flaw in your argument is that it profiles but if you remove the profiling and say "" it 's not wrong to maintain a healthy detachment from strangers , and by locking my doors or passively avoiding strangers , i have a better chance of remaining safe "" and thus you have a statement that 's not only a better argument but a sound one but because it 's sound , nobody would really have to argue with you at all because any normal person who is n't incredibly naive or thick would be like "" yea , fair enough . while it is n't wrong to lock doors and avoid those in poverty , it can be unethical . many of the people living on the streets had no chance at living a "" normal life "" so to speak , due to the family they were born into , their racial income , etc . however , if a man is on the street and is obviously homeless and holds up a sign stating that he is hungry , it would be just plain selfish to not share some food you do n't need that you have in the back of your car . street smarts are a concept invented by people to spin it so that they 're still smart even though they never got good grades or did well in school . street smarts do n't happen at the expense of book smarts . if you feel threatened by someone 's behavior in a reasonable way , it 's not un pc to be safe . however if the same behavior by another person does n't bother you , you might ask yourself why . i think your main point is too vague to be changed , yes choosing pc over your safety is not good imo , however for your own benefit you should n't be so cautious around people , learning to not be paranoid will make life much better . i ’m not fully aware of the statistical reality of criminality and homelessness so i can only base my understanding of the likelihood of being robbed by someone homeless on intuition . however in big cities ( or at least the one i live in ) there are a lot of people , law enforcement , cctvs , etc . even if you lock your door or cross the street ."
9xizk1,"there is no logical way to prove that being unfair is wrong . i 've asked people what they would say if they were asked "" why is being unfair wrong ? "" . one response was that "" the party did n't deserve that type of treatment . "" but that 's just another phrasing of being unfair . i decided to think for myself logically why being unfair is wrong and so far i 've only managed to come up with a few flawed answers . firstly , being unfair is self-evidently wrong . now this works out , until you realise that different people in different environments would find different values to be self-evident . for example , if a human were to grow up alone without being in contact with another human since he was first conscious , then what he would n't find fairness to be self-evident . instead , what he wo n't hesitate to do is kill others for whatever reasons he sees fit . he would see what he does as being acceptable , but we would n't . however , it would be impossible to convince him that others have a right to life because he grew not knowing empathy . if we apply this to the current context , then people in the west find different morals to be self-evident than people in asia or the middle east . yet everyone claims the other is inhumane , with no explanation how it is inhumane , or what is inhumane . another answer why being unfair is wrong is that it without fairness , society would n't function optimally . however if i purge the retired elderly or the ill who needlessly consume resources , then it would boost the cogs of society , wouldnt it ? its still considered wrong . therefore this answer is invalid . anyone have answers for the question "" why is being unfair wrong ? ""","you said that it is not self-evident because different people perceive morality differently and the wrongness of unfairness is not self-evident to everybody . although i ca n't say for sure , i suspect that anybody you ask to think about that will be able to tell that it 's True merely by inward reflection . the interior angles of any flat triangle will add up to 180 degrees . this one is also self-evident because one can reflect on it and see that it 's necessarily True merely by inward reflection . however , this is so difficult to see without drawing triangles and doing algebra on a sheet of paper that most people ca n't see it . suppose you 're among the people for whom it 's plainly obvious that the pathagorean theory is True and that interior angles of triangles add up to 180 degrees . does the mere fact that there are some people who lack the brain capacity to see these things as clear as you do give you any reason at all to doubt what you see clearly ? in the same way , it if it is perfectly self-evident to somebody that unfairness is morally wrong , then that person has justification for thinking unfairness is morally wrong regardless of whether other people can see it or not . the mere existence of people who do n't see things as clearly is no reason at all for anybody who does see it to have doubts anymore than the mere existence of blind people is a reason for seeing people to have doubts about the existence of color . i suspect the wrongness of unfairness is something that everybody apprehends even at a very young age . anybody in any culture who has ever raised kids knows that at one point or another you 're going to do something to which the kid responds with something like , "" that 's not fair ! "" what the kid is implying is , "" that 's not fair ; therefore , you should n't do it . "" and if they can surround themselves with other people who do it , that helps even more . but all these people are doing is suppressing the knowledge . unless a society reinforces moral knowledge through some kind of shame , it 's very easy for people to suppress their moral knowledge when it comes into conflict with their self-interest . the fact that people behave unfairly does n't mean they do n't know that unfairness is wrong . in order to defend the argument , a question has to be made into a claim or statement . let 's change this to a statement : being unfair is wrong . if "" fair "" is defined as "" without cheating or trying to achieve unjust advantage . "" ( unfair is the negation of fair , not is added to the definition below ) . and if we define "" just "" as "" based on or behaving according to what is morally right "" , and if we define "" morally "" as "" actions that maximize the wellbeing of others "" . and wellbeing is defined as "" the state of being comfortable , healthy , or happy . "" we then drive the definition of unfair as "" not behaving in accordance with actions that maximize the state of comfort , health , or happiness "" also , if we define "" moral "" as actions that maximize the wellbeing of others ( immoral is the negation of moral , not is added to the definition below ) . and if "" wellbeing "" is defined as "" the state of being comfortable , healthy , or happy . "" then we derive a definition of wrong as "" not an action that maximize the state of comfort , health , or happiness . "" then we convert the two definitions from the original statement to : "" not behaving in accordance with actions that maximize the state of comfort , health , or happiness "" is "" not an action that maximizes a state of being comfortable , healthy , or happy "" . if we remove the double negatives from this statement we get : "" behaving in accordance with actions that maximize the state of comfort , health , or happiness "" is "" an action that maximizes a state of being comfortable , healthy , or happy "" . if we remove the double negatives from your original question "" why us unfair wrong "" we get , "" why is fair right ? if you value fairness , then you can call unfair actions wrong . so if you goal is to prove that is wrong to be unfair , then what you need to do is work out a set of values that everyone should share . unfairness is n't objectively justifiable as wrong because no moral idea is objectively justifiable . but we have a variety of frameworks by which we organize our moral intuitions and structures . it would take a while to do it rigorously , but if you really wanted , i could give you a consistent argument for the value of fairness within consequentialism , deontology , virtue ethics , and even non western moral frameworks like confucianism and hindu moral traditions . and if you 're asking a moral question , all you can look for are arguments within moral frameworks . to prove something is "" wrong "" you must first make certain subjective judgements , such as "" human suffering is wrong "" , which have nothing to do with logic . as an adverb , google 's definition of ' fair ' is ' without cheating or trying to achieve unjust advantage . ' google 's definition of ' just ' is ' based on or behaving according to what is morally right and fair . ' so if being unfair is cheating or trying to achieve an ' unjust ' advantage , and an ' unjust advantage ' is one that is morally wrong and unfair , then that means that something that is unfair is therefore morally wrong . if one makes a decision to be unfair to others , a multitude of undesirable consequences are to be expected . if the instigator refuses to acknowledge the possibility of undesirable consequences , then he/she is not rational/logical and , therefore , logically wrong in being unfair . now if you take the statement "" treat others as you would want them to treat you "" , we can find that it works in any moral setting . and if "" treat others as you would want them to treat you "" is always right , then it obviously is n't wrong . it also implies fairness implicitly - and hence , it proves unfair treatment is wrong . i think you stumbled onto the correct answer then dismissed it with a faulty analogy . some degree of fairness is necessary for society to function . if there were no relation between the goodness you put into it and the goodness you get out of it , people would largely just look for themselves at any cost regardless of the impact on others . we seem to have several "" moral foundations "" or underlying moral principles which may very well be built into us at a genetic level . these foundations exist across all studies cultures and seem to be fairly robust predictors of moral thought and action . so , as far as being human is concerned , fairness is wrong because we have evolved to feel that it is wrong . there are logical reasons why we could justify why fairness is good , but at the end of the day that gut feeling which ( almost all ) people share might be the most important reason to think that it 's wrong to be unfair . if we are doing an experiment on the heights of different people and their reaction speeds , and you measure one person with his shoes on ( unlike all others who took off his shoes ) , your experiment is already inherently unfair and our hypothesis wrong , logically . unfair because there are more variables than we wanted to test , and wrong because our hypothesis could be affected by said variables . this shows that it is very possible to prove logically that it 's wrong to be unfair . in order to adequately dismiss this reasoning , you need to create a situation in which society would actually be benefited from unfairness . as it is , humans are particularly sensitive to unfairness and when it reaches a certain level , we react violently to it . let 's take as a premise that there is an objective morality . this is a fair premise because if there is n't an objective morality , discussing whether or not something is "" wrong "" is a moot point . by the statement "" unfair "" , i assume that there is some kind of "" game "" or "" system "" that has some kind of rules or conventions . the action of being "" unfair "" is rigging those conventions or rules to one 's advantage . for a moral system to be objective , it must apply the same way to everyone . writing different rules for yourself than for everyone else in your moral system would imply the morals are subjective . so , if one is to say that "" rigging "" the system by acting unfair is morally acceptable , then it is acceptable for anyone to rig the rules to any extent they are capable . is the idea "" everyone should work within the system or abide by the rules "" consistent with the idea "" the person who is ahead should be able to rig the system or the rules ? "" although you could never actually eliminate all of your personal biases and prejudices , you would need to take steps at least to minimize them . rawls suggests that you imagine yourself in an original position behind a veil of ignorance . behind this veil , you know nothing of yourself and your natural abilities , or your position in society . behind such a veil of ignorance all individuals are simply specified as rational , free , and morally equal beings . you do know that in the "" real world "" , however , there will be a wide variety in the natural distribution of natural assets and abilities , and that there will be differences of sex , race , and culture that will distinguish groups of people from each other . >> as rawls put it , "" no one knows his place in society , his class position or social status ; nor does he know his fortune in the distribution of natural assets and abilities , his intelligence and strength , and the like "" . [ 1 ] the idea of the thought experiment is to render obsolete those personal considerations that are morally irrelevant to the justice or injustice of principles meant to allocate the benefits of social cooperation . since one may occupy any position in the society once the veil is lifted , the device forces the parties to consider society from the perspective of all members , including the worst-off and best-off members ."
9xemez,"there is no logically consistent reason to prohibit smoking for under-18s while allowing it for adults i 'm not arguing that all smoking should be banned , or that it should be allowed for everybody . what i 'm saying is there is no logically consistent reason to make it illegal for people under 18 while allowing it for adults . the problem is with the argument : "" people under 18 have on average worse judgment than people over 18 , so it makes sense to restrict their right to buy cigarettes to stop them from harming themselves . "" but if that 's True , that only means that the percent of 13-17-year-olds who exhibit that bad judgment and decide to smoke , is going to be higher than the percent of people 18-and-older who exhibit that bad judgment and decide to smoke . it 's not a reason to \ only \ target the people under 18 who make that bad decision . if you 're starting with the general principle that we ought to intervene to protect people whose judgment is bad enough that they are making a decision that will harm themselves , then even if there are more people in group a than group b who make that decision , that certainly does n't mean we should only target group a ! ( perhaps you 'd say that a cigarette is more harmful to a teenager 's lungs than an adult 's because a teen 's lungs are still developing , but the problem with that is that surely there 's some number of cigarettes -- 5 or 10 or whatever -- that is just as harmful to an adult 's lungs as 1 cigarette is for a teenager 's lungs . so then the argument just becomes : if you would prohibit the teenager from having 1 cigarette , then you should at least prohibit the adult from having 10 . ) look , i think it 's a near-tragedy if a 15-year-old starts a smoking habit that is going to cut several months or years off of her life , and is possibly even going to cause health problems for people around her , and on top of everything else is going to be a massively expensive and inconvenient addiction . but i do n't see why we should feel any less sad if a 22-year-old does the same thing . some people say , essentially : "" it 's not really about the judgment of adults vs. minors , it 's just that i think adults ' right to do what they want is sacred , but i do n't feel the same way about people under 18 . "" ok , so to those people , that 's just an axiom , and it 's not subject to debate . but if you choose that as an axiom , then you 're not really in a position to argue that your position is better than someone who says : "" i think that men 's rights to do what they want is sacred , but i do n't feel the same way about women 's rights . "" to them , that 's an axiom , and it 's not subject to debate , either . now , if you 're protesting : "" hey , that 's not the same , there are way more significant differences between adults and kids ! "" -- well , good ! that means you do n't think the rules for adults vs. kids are axioms , but rather that they can be derived from other principles about costs and benefits of safety . and i think there are a lot of good rules that do pass that test ( we do n't let kids drop out of 6th grade to work in coal mines any more ) . but since smoking harms both adults and minors ( and in both cases harms people around them ) , i ca n't think of a non \ - "" axiomatic "" reason to ban it for people under 18 but allow it for adults . cmv .","the idea behind the restrictions most likely does not come from our law prioritizing the health of children over the health of adults . but a child ca n't really make that decision . they lack the cognitive development to understand the consequences of the decision , so we do n't permit them to make the decision at all . statutory rape is a crime because the idea is that even if a 15 year old consents , they do n't have the ability to actually make an informed decision yet . so we do n't consider them able to truly make the judgement , and thus just prohibit the behavior . children do n't have full autonomy ( guardians are at least partially responsible for their decisions / actions ) thus there is a logical argument for children not to being legally allowed to smoke as it would constitute child abuse by the guardian , and is thus illegal . people under 18 would get addicted earlier in life and that is a bad for their health and for society . however , the human brain does not fully develop until the early twenties , and tobacco can affect brain development , so there is a good reason to prohibit teens from using tobacco . in fact , biologically speaking , tobacco should be prohibited until 25 or so . accordingly , we limit their power to make self-harming decisions ( like drugs , alcohol , sex and smoking ) . let me ask you this , what is the difference between smoking and sex is for the purposes of your argument -- or do you think kids should be allowed to consent to sex as well ? because i see no logically consistent difference between the two for the purposes of the argument you are making . we do n't let kids make harmful life choices for the protect them from theirselves as brains do n't reach full maturity until 25ish . but at a certain point , people have to be granted the autonomy to make poor life choices or we do n't live in a free society . delaying the age when kids first experiment or begin using tobacco can reduce the risk that they transition to regular or daily tobacco use and increase their chances of successfully quitting , if they do become regular users . this seems a logically consistent reason to ban smoking for people under 18 according to the nih smoking and exposure to nicotine can have an impact on brain development , which adolescents are still going through . i would say that preventing children from damaging their own brains , especially while their prefrontal cortex ( the part of your brain responsible for decision-making ) is still developing is a logical reason to prohibit smoking in children but allow it in adults ( adults , i would argue , should have the right to destroy their brains as they see fit ) . and i suppose ideally we should reevaluate what it means to be an adult in our society since brain development can last well into the 20 's ."

culture . in the end , the definitions are a more polite and less overt way of saying “ the countries where the white people are ” and as such are used as a way to promote racism and make white people seem superior . point 1 : “ the west ” is used wrongly to associate non-western people , ideas , and groups . for example , ancient greece and ancient rome are both often seen as part of “ the west ” when they certianly would not consider themselves part of the west . they did not consider themselves as part of europe . and europeans were seen as a seperate group . however the ancient greeks and romans are both seen as the start of the west and such their ideas are seen as western . this is not True . most greek philosphers spent more time in the middle east than anywhere else . by associating them with “ the west ” you take away the massive middle eastern influences . another core idea co-opted from the middle east is the “ judo-christian values ” definition . both religions originated in the middle east and both of the religions are pretty exclusive to the middle east ( in terms of the writing and stories ) . this is used specfically to wipe middle eastern influence from what “ the west ” considers the highest point of society . point 2 : the cold war defintion also seems unTrue to me . all of germany , italy , greece , and scananavia are all seen as part of the west but all were influenced/ruled over/on the side of the ussr . the eastern block and the ussr are gone so if this is the reason for the definition it is outdated when used in a modern context . i believe the reason why the eastern block countries and russia are still not seen as part of “ the west ” is because of racism agaisnt slavic and gypsy ( romany and other travellers ) . they also defest the purpose of “ the west ” being advanced and superior as those countries struggle with poverty currently . if you want to say that either terms are used to differentiate between communism and capitalistic countries during the cold war then south korea , japan , india , and most parts of africa should all be considered part of “ the west ” or the “ free world ” but they are not . point 3 : exclusion of non-white countries ( both phrases ) and racism . south america speaks the same languages of many european countries . south america shares a lot of culture with many european countries . south america is a very christian continent and catholicism is wide spread . it is not seen as part of the west or the free world . the only differentation is that they are brown . the original use of “ the free world ” was to describe the allies agaisnt the axies . originally south american countries , asian countries , the ussr , and african countries were very much included in the definition . but now they are not . because the definition has been twisted because of racism . point 4 : both are used for superiority agaisnt non-white countries . the “ free world ” is used to describe white countries to associate white countries with freedom . white countries are pictured as having no couruption and a perfectly working democracy . and even if it is n’t pictured at that extreme it is always pictured as better than the countries excluded . “ the west ” term is used to wipe out eastern and oriental contributions . it is used to pretend like western ideals originated in the west and only came from the west . it is used to pretend that western ideals are only shared between the west ( and thus we are very different from everywhere else ) . conclusion : both are terms in modern day use is inherently racist . and originated ( “ the west ” ) or quickly convoluted ( “ the free world ” ) into ways to spread racist ideals . they should not be used anymore . please change all or any part of my view . i tried to seperate it into seperate points but feel free to tackle all or however many you want .","you 'll get an a on whatever paper you 're writing though . of the nations listed the only ones who sided with the ussr during the cold war was eastern germany . western germany sided with the us and western germany was the government and culture that took over when the ussr fell . the free world is referring to countries with central ideas from the philosophy of the enlightenment . these ideas are central for many countries and essential for democracy . when your country embraces those ideas they can become part of the western ( i.e. the free ) world . especially since people who live in the west live under financial slavery . i use the term "" western "" to differentiate the good aspects of american and european culture from some horrendous cultures , like islam . slavic countires aka warsaw pact were not among the west because they were the second world or soviet sphere of influence thus by definition not western/free during the cold war.racism had absolutely nothing to do with this division . exclusion of non-white countries ( both phrases ) and racism . in these definitions even in the cold war time japan and south korea was included in the west/free world similarly taiwan . ussr was never included in the free world and even during ww2 there was a distinction between western allies and the soviet union . the “ free world ” is used to describe white countries to associate white countries with freedom . nah it is used to describe countries that for example have personal freedom of it 's citizens like us or japan vs nations that had little to no freedom like ussr and racial element was never an important part of this . latin america was on the sidelines of the cold war and within us sphere of influence and unlike africa was not really an area of struggle between the superpowers with the exception of cuba . if you are a tourist do you need to change any of the ways you fundamentally interact with government or people ? if you get robbed can you go to the cops and not worry about having to pay a bribe or being charged yourself for reporting a criminal who has paid the police protection money ? if you get in a car accident do you need to worry about being taken to a "" bad "" hospital where the doctors paid for their degrees and the blood they give you is expired ? if you walk into a restaurant can you expect the food served to be safe and that you wo n't be targeted to be robbed because you are an outsider ? do you need to be careful not to walk across locally known "" lines "" for fear of violent assault for being in someone 's territory ? basically the entire western world operates based on the same assumptions - that things are fair and the government is there to help administer fair systems . if you ever travel as a tourist to a non-western country you will immediately be warned about , and notice , the difference . greek philosophy is classified as part of western philosophy and while i have n't studied non-western philosophical traditions extensively , as far as i know nobody else claims them as part of "" the west . "" the idea that "" white "" is a race is relatively new , yet we still classify people who would not have called themselves white as white . according to this map , poland is part of the west . i think the "" free world "" / "" western world "" being synonymous was cemented by the ussr 's attitude towards freedom . south america is sometimes considered sort of western depending on who you ask . and i would consider anyone of any race with american values to have western values regardless of their race , just as i would consider a white person raised in the east to have non-western values . this is because white countries largely had freedom , especially in the modern world . a lot of non-western countries were a little late in abolishing slavery , and even today if you look at things like free speech , freedom of religion , and so on they all prosper the most in the west . just because the west is a beacon of freedom and a model for others does not make it perfect . so racist is the wrong term considering russia is largely white . russia lacks freedoms present in most other 1st world countries . west or free world typically means a country that does n't have waring factions within it 's borders , an active and effective government , yet still offering a great deal of personal freedoms and individuality . if you could list countries that should be considered part of the "" free world "" that arent , that might help your point ."
9xc5cp,"people who are asexual should not be considered lgbtq + i ’m bisexual , i ’ve been apart of the community for many years in various organizations advocating for equal rights . recently , people have started to include asexual people under the queer umbrella . and , people have gotten mad at me when i ’ve suggested asexual people are not lgbtq . being lgbtq and having support and community for that is important because it ’s a marginalized identity . people around the world literally die everyday because they ’re gay or trans . but no one cares if you do n’t like sex . no one ’s trying to take away asexual people ’s rights or disowning them from their families . obviously if your trans and asexual that ’s lgbtq , but i ’m tired of straight cis people saying they ’re queer because they do n’t like sex ! then often people who are asexual reap lgbtq benefits , like programs and trips . they talk about how forming relationships is hard because they have to tell their partner they do n’t want sex . that ’s difficult , yes , but that ’s not anything close to societal structures that make your love illegal or punishable by death . i think most of them are people with very low sex drives ( which is cool and fine and no one care ) who want to be trendy so they decided to call themselves lgbtq . it hurts my community and work because it takes away resources from those who need them and reenforces the idea that it ’s just trendy to be lgbtq in the states and ignores all of the immense homophobia/transphobia we go through . i want to stress that i do n’t dislike asexual people at all and they should have their own programming and trips and resources , i just do n’t think they should be included in things meant for lgbtq people . i know i sound bigoted , please change my view .","people , especially my family and people who used to be my friends , really care that i do n't like sex . even before i had the word for it , when i was just trying to describe to people that i was n't interested in sex , they took it to mean that some conversion therapy was in order . by the time i told my family about it , they were ... simply supportive of the idea that a group of my friends got together to rape me in the hopes of making me enjoy sex . i 'm reasonably certain that if someone supports raping you for your sexual identity , that 's discrimination . later on , my family just decided i was gay because it 's much easier than believing i 'm ace . half my extended family disowned me over that one and the other half still does n't accept that i 'm ace . on a day to day basis , i have to tread the line between pretending i 'm straight or bi or gay or something and who i really am because everytime it comes out that i 'm ace , everyone gets on my case . telling me that i just have n't found the right person yet , telling me that i need to divorce my husband and find a woman if i feel that way , saying that it 's the hormones i 'm on ( or before , the hormones i 'm not on ) that are causing it , or that i 'm just someone with a very low sex drive who wants to be trendy , or just simply being unable to believe that i can exist . we do n't say that bi people should n't be in the movement because they can pass for straight , we should n't say ace people should n't be in the movement because they can pass for straight . what 's easier , saying the lgbtq movement is about accepting people regardless of who they love and how they love ? or saying that we should accept sexual acts between consenting adults and ignore those people over there . however , i believe that a better world is one where we get rights and public acceptance for all sexual minorities . i 'd say that the lgbtq movement would have an easier time pursuing total acceptance and fighting the kinds of prejudice that are common between all of us , rather than only fighting for the right to have sex with anyone we choose . because that 's the world were homosexual sex is legal , no one is killed for it , but things still suck . i want a world where i can be openly ace without wishing i had just kept it to myself and i think that goal is very much in line with lgbtq . i know one ace personally and it seems like the pressures and persecution she faces is quite similar to those of the other lgbtq + folk i know . she does n’t get as much overt hate - but outside of trans folk , that is blessedly declining . it ’s ruined friendship after friendship for her , which matches the experience i ’ve seen from others . as by ruined , i mean in a way that most lgbt + are familiar with : extremely hateful and bigoted comments from people you had considered friends . again - this does n’t encompass the entire spectrum of harassment experienced by other lgbt + folk but neither do bi-folk share the same problems as gay , and no-one has it as bad as trans these days . coming from someone outside of that spectrum entirely , someone who just hopes to be an ally , i see people sharing the same common issue - the fight to be yourself in a society that does n’t want to accept your self as normal . people have expectations of how other people interact with sex , and in a lot of ways . asexual people have an easier time passing than a lot of other queer identities , but , y' know , so do bisexuals who are with the opposite gender of person . people care if you say you do n't want sex , i think . finally , i will note that jocelyn didomenick , the writer of rain , has noted that , between her trans identity and her asexual identity , the latter is what has lead to her receiving more discrimination . asexuality is not a low sex drive or ' disliking ' sex . low sex drive is not asexuality , no sex drive is . there are a couple of points here that display the prejudice and discrimination that asexuals face , both from heterosexuals and within the lgbt + community . so , while being asexual is not the same type of prejudice as being gay , bi , or trans , there is still prejudice and discrimination - the stereoype of the asexual is someone who can not feel any emotion at all , who is robot-like and incapable of human connection just because they do n't like sex . not sure if having no sex drive would be seen as trendy . sex drive is a massive part of all cultures , both explicitly and implicitly , so having low or no sex drive puts you firmly in a sexual minority . lgbtq + is intended to be a catch-all term ( especially when the "" + "" is included , obviously ) for sexual minorities , so it follows that you 'd include asexuals in there . and asexual people are sexual minorities -- their romantic and sexual experiences are quite different than mine is , as a straight person . the same arguments you 're using have been levied against bi and trans people both historically and currently . bi people are "" basically straight "" and trans people "" do n't have anything to do with sexuality "" and they 're taking "" resources "" away from the "" real queers "" who "" really need them "" just to be trendy . ace people fall prey to much of the same problems other queer folks do -- getting kicked out of home , conversion therapy , assault aimed at "" fixing "" them ( these are all things that have happened to people i know ) , as well as very difficult coming out processes that are met with a lot of derision . in addition , regarding the resources question , what resources are they taking ? they 're not getting free condoms , obviously , they 're not going to safe sex seminars for the most part . most ace people i know do a lot of door to door campaigning for things like marriage equality , should they step aside so that place can be filled be different person ? in terms of charity work , the more people that use your services the better , because it means better funding in the next quarter and then better services for everyone using them . on the topic of what makes someone queer , do you believe it 's only your attraction to your own gender that entitles you to be under the acronym ? others in exclusionist circles might eventually argue that you 're only queer when you 're dating the right people or are visibly trans . it 's certainly True that what aces experience is not exactly the same as what gay people experience , however both can experience various forms of discrimination and societal pressure due to their orientation . here 's a way of framing the orientation that may be helpful - roughly speaking , if we take the attraction to the opposite sex of heterosexuality and the attraction to the same sex homosexuality , we get bisexuality . if we take the lack of attraction to the same sex of heterosexuality and lack of attraction to the opposite sex of homosexuality , we get asexuality . the point is that ace people are about as straight as bi people . personally , i would argue that since straightness is composed of both attraction to the opposite sex and lack of attraction to the same sex , neither ace people nor bi people can be considered straight . as you have pointed out , in many contexts aces tend to be pretty ' invisible ' , so if you 've ever expressed the sentiment that sexual attraction or intimacy is ' part of what makes us human ' or ' something everyone experiences ' in front of others , you may have said that to an asexual person , unintentionally implying to their face that they are not human . in some cultural contexts where singleness is especially unusual an asexual individual 's lack of apparent attraction to the opposite sex may also cause some individuals to conclude that they must be gay , and they may be functionally treated as a gay person . i know for a fact that before i realized i was asexual i had quite a lot of people assume i was gay . it was actually people asking me if i was gay and me not having an answer that was the catalyst for me to do the research to figure out that i was in fact asexual . as far as my personal experiences go , i 've found that most people who i have decided it 's safe to tell that i 'm ace say they do n't think it 's a big deal , but go on to speculate about my upbringing , health and other things . they wonder aloud if perhaps the fact that i was raised christian means that i 'm actually gay but repressing it , or if i have some sort of medical condition that 's depressing my sex drive . even people who are trying to be supportive tend to other and infantilize asexual people . i think that just shows how pervasive our cultural ideas around sex as a fundamental part of what makes us human are . i only need a community to feel like i ’m not alone or a freak , like the asexuals . i do n’t think i should be a priority and do n’t think people like me should get a huge say in the community , but i think we belong . homosexuality is about sexual preference while transsexuals believe they were born the wrong sex ."
9xblyd,"scott tucker is a cautionary tale against people who do n't lobby . this is one of my less polished cmv , so please be kind . i just watched netflix original dirty money -- url -- episode 2 about scott tucker -- url -- ) tldr of the episode : he 's a payday loan shark , exploiting fine prints and indian tribe sovereignty legal loophole . he got rich , caught by ftc , and was a record judgement of us $ 1.266 billion in fine , on top of decades of criminal charges . i think it is a very balanced documentary , giving a full coverage of scott 's side . scott 's side is basically : everything he did was legal according to the letter of the law , or at the very least , it is a common business practice . he accused the government of being as mean and intimidatory as possible ( e.g . he and his associate was swatted ) . i have some sort of sympathy for him . it seems that he simply looked around , sees people doing these things and getting away with it , but when he did the same thing , only better , the government got him and punished him harder than other people who might be even more evil than him : -- url -- -- url -- -- url -- but my sympathy ends there . besides the alleged government intimidation , he definitely deserve every single second in the sentence and every single penny in the fine . my biggest takeaway from the whole thing was not that he was evil ( he was ) . but that the government did nothing for 15 years , and nothing to the other predatory lenders . it really seems that the full intention of the government is to make an example out of him , not to scare out bad people , but show the strong arm of the government : "" this is the full might of the government , befriend us . "" and by that , i mean , "" if you 're doing something shady , or you are afraid to fall into legal landmine , whip out an army of lobbyist . "" now i do n't have a hard evidence against this . it just seems to be the most befitting narrative considering all the circumstances : government did n't come to scott until he got very rich ( and able to lobby ) government did n't come to other smaller predatory lender he was given record judgement in fine , even more than madoff ( $ 65 billion ) , when he profited less ( $ 3.5 billion profit ) a good way to cmv simply argue for a more compelling narrative , why was scott punishment was more than other white collar criminals .","that is a formula for a lighter sentence for everybody from drug dealers to fraudsters regardless of lobbying . shkreli was convicted of ( i think ) 2 crimes and acquitted of 5 others by a jury of his peers . i do n't see how lobbying would help a jury acquit him unless you want to assert that the us attorneys sandbagged the case . tucker was convicted of ( i think ) 14 crimes , took it through a lengthy trial ( no plea deal ) , was not needed in other prosecutions , and , again , has prior felony convictions ."
9xbau5,"modern day soldiers ( thinking of nato , especially us ) are nothing more than mercenaries and people should look down on anyone who can not explain the decisions that have them deployed overseas in another country apologies but since the ideea is so short and clear what follows is more of a rant than anything else . you have americans especially on reddit offhandedly sharing that they are part of the army , sharing warstories as if its normal to have warstories in 2018 , as if we had wars that were black and white and them having a part in those wars should just be commendable and a tribute to their courage or something , and people bragging about being veterans , as if the wars they fought were fully justified and clear cut . it 's no longer like vietnam with people answering drafts , and even wars like vietnam should not be something people should be bragging about . it 's not just about those specific imperialist mindsets , but the us in particular have this indoctrination at work that has them actually bragging about participating in invasions of other countries . i do n't believe this view of mine is controversial or that it needs sources , i think it 's just common sense . war is not something one should be bragging about , and in an age where picking up a weapon and killing people is only motivated by a salary and career and maybe other even more imoral ( maybe amoral ? i 'm pretty sure imoral would be a better word here ) reasons , not an existential threat to one 's homeland , then it should be absolutely condemnet . the fact that you have americans who just talk about how they were feeling buddy buddy with each other and maybe have issues and no job prospects coming back from their deployment should n't raise any more compassion than one should have for someone who chose to work in mcdonalds and be poor but did n't make the choice to go kill people according to the propaganda that they fed you to feel ok about it . i 'm not even sure if non-americans dont predominantly feel the same way , since most countries are n't this full of pro-military propaganda in their commercials , culture , etc . there are i feel countless arguments to say that the us by far the most full of this kind of propaganda out of nato , not least of all is the monstruosity of their military budget that dwarfs all other nations and earth and nobody seems to care that it keeps growing even to the detriment of their healthcare , education , infrastructure etc .","point 2 : "" people should look down on anyone who can not explain the decisions that have them deployed overseas in another country "" i do n't see how intervening in a civil war in afghanistan and punishing iraq for breaking a peace treaty are war crimes . these are entirely justifiable wars given the information that was present at the time the decisions were made . multiple nations spend much more on their military than the us in terms of % of gdp.us economy is just freakishly big ."
9xb77f,"democracies should only let people who know what they are voting about , and for who vote it seems more and more people blindly follow the news , do n't think for their own and take what they hear from biased and unbiased sources to be the truth . this ofcourse is not a good way to go and vote . this also is not a question if you 're a right or left winger . it 's a question about rational thinking . now my idea is , before people vote they have to show they know what they are voting for . this could be done in a test form where the voter is asked multiple questions . an important question could be why are you voting for this person/party now , you ca n't be punished because of an opinion , but you can be punished when you do n't answer right . so for example saying : "" i vote for x because i like her "" . is a bad way , this person wo n't be allowed to vote the whole voting proces would change the tests could be taken on a monday , you could retake your test 2 days later . then on friday the votes are in , and the newly ellected are chosen","classism , as wealth of parents often translates into the education of offspring . those with learning disabilities will essentially get denied their vote all of this leaves a lot of demographic groups voiceless within the democracy . this raises the question about whether qor not those who are allowed to vote will also look after the rights of those exempt from voting . while i agree in theory that only people who educate themselves on the candidates and topics involved should vote , you would end up with horrifying abuse or if you managed to avoid abused , whoever lost would claim the other side abused the system to roof the election . you could likely get all the intended result by removing all indication of party affiliation from candidate during voting . in addition , we should automatically disqualify any candidate who claims a party affiliation ( effectively banning political parties . ) yes , and the test must include a part where you recite many verses from the bible , to prevent those ignorant of christ and therefore of the basic tenets of proper human morality from voting at all . once you 've recited enough verses , if you still disagree with christ 's word , you 'll be free to vote for someone who rejects it . how could you stop people from using the same answer as a friend who biased them to vote for "" x "" person ? the only issue with this is how effective standard questions would be and the time we 're investing to gauge an individuals competency to vote . different beliefs and standpoints that are non standard in your test might be seen as invalid and exclude a voter who is competent . first of all there 's the question of forcing people to find two free time slots in the same week to go to vote . you 're not really punishing people who have ' bad ' reasons to choose a candidate , you 're punishing people who sucks at writing essays about their opinion . plus , you know it completely destroys the secrecy of the voting booth if you 're forced to preemptively write an essay about who you want to vote for . and even more difficult , what extent of knowledge is required , and who gets to determine the right answers . if i am very informed but unlucky in the test , it is not fair to deprive me if the right to participate in choosing who rules me . not just in formulating and administering the test , but in the thousands if not mlions of legal challenges by failed voters who allege they were wrongly scored or the test was systemically discriminating against them . also , the last time we instilled a voting test , there were some issues ... -- url -- beside that , yes , i do n't vote for her political views , but i believe her political position has no real power because other administration i trust will handle the situation , but her post has a very important public image , and for my z to be well perceived and respected , which is important to me and my business ( for example ) having a person of charisma behind this post is very important to me . "" should you ignore his vote ( he justify by his hate for the first candidate ) ? but his belief that having a gay leader might cause punishment from a god , women are less capable of having a job with responsibility and should stay at home with her kids , his belief that black people are lesser humans that should n't be have any authority on white people ( i 'm sorry for writing all that ) , are as much political opinions as the opinion of somebody who would vote y because x have an history of being suspected of corruption . both votes are based on the candidate and not just his program , and and as much as i would like to refuse the vote of the first guy , and accept the vote of the second guy , this would be placing my moral and my opinion above the democracy to judge who is worthy or not to vote . a second problem , if that political candidate and parties would probably starts to tell their potential voters what they should write in the test , which quite does n't look like a good thing to me . once you start to go down the path of choosing who gets to vote , you are not longer a democracy . in return youre given a vote to use in whatever way you want and shouldnt be babies or restricted on how you express your opinion the idea of a poll test is n't inherently bad , but ultimately it allows a small group to decide who wins elections by deciding which questions to ask . it would be an entirely different issue if you were offering something like a tax break for people who pass the test on election day . voter tests have historically been used to suppress the votes of marginalised communities , so you would n't ever have a lot of "" unbiased "" support for this every test of bias , including implicit bias tests , can be gamed to give the right answer , and every unscrupulous person in a campaign would want at least one person there to only legitimise votes in their favour ."
9xas9t,"we should follow the nordic model when it comes to prostitution , that is it is illegal to buy sex but not to sell it . far too many men and women are trafficked and forced in to prostitution . when caught its unfair someone who had no choice in the matter is arrested . there 's so many stories of men ( and some women ) knowing rightly that the prostitute was underage or unwilling but they still follow through with it . those people in my opinion are just as much a rapist as those who drag strangers in a dark alley , and they should be arrested . people may say that prostitution is the only answer for some people , but at the end of the day if a man or a woman is starving you have to feed them , not exploit them . people also say its just like any other job , but is there a high risk of pregnancy , ptsd , rape and violence , stds , drug addiction and more with working at mcdonalds ?? legalising prostitution may not work either , as there are stories of rapists who got let off by telling the jury their victim was a prostitute . it would also mean a pimp would n't get in trouble for their exploitation . one time i was talking to my cousin who said there 's nothing wrong with buying a prostitute . i said to him would you like it if you were a 16 year old boy and being forced into having intercourse with many men . he said no . sure , not all prostitutes are victims of human trafficking , but far too many of them are in order to feel at ease with legalising it . i 'm open minded however and would like my viewpoint challenged .","first , if the prostitute agrees to engage in prostitution and retains the right to do or not do anything . second , if the prostitute is forced to do it . in this case everyone making the decisions , the pimp and the client , is breaking the law . the situation for these prostitutes does n't change much , because they never engaged with the law in the first place , their only interface with it is through the pimps . at most , if a raid does occur , these prostitutes will be released to be taken advantage of by another pimp rather than be taken into custody . the majority of men ( who are the vast majority the use prostitutes ) do n’t want to have sex with trafficked individuals , now you will get arrested for doing it . the majority of risk to women in prostitution , i.e violence comes from them being exploited , if you make it illegal to pay it makes it far more difficult for them to form groups to hire protection for these reasons . it increase the danger to workers , does not interact with trafficking , and there are far better things you can do to stop prostitution , or prevent trafficking . you can legalize prostitution and still make forced prostitution illegal . as it is , it 's the woman who gets prosecuted , not the person forcing them into prostitution most of the time . then you live in a failed country filled to the brim of moral delinquents , a stain on the world and humanity . i have n't thought too much into what would happen to the human trafficking aspect should we ( the u.s ) decriminalize or make legal the sex-for-money business . human trafficking ( this would include the continued victimization of these victims by their ' pimps ' ) the arrest of both the ' johns ' and the person being paid . while the arrest record of people just doing what animals do , just with a monetary agreement , is important : i do view the trafficking and victimization of those who do not desire to be in this business a far greater issue . if prostitution we legalized the government will naturally want their share . you will always have those who will steal other humans and force them into the role of victim , but for those who are in the business because of life circumstance ( runaways , homeless , people who just like to have sex and decide ' why not get paid for it ' ) will have a way to sell sex and not have the fear of being arrested ( furthering their plight ) and if they ever did want to leave their pimp in favor of entrepreneurship or are just tired of being beaten by the person that is taking a cut of their wages the one light at the end of the tunnel is they can ! i would hope the stigma of sex would be less prevalent ( as it has become with pot ) and they would have resources ( maybe a union-type thing ) that would help them establish rights just as any other worker in the us has . i would hope that a person looking to pay for sex would opt for the worker that is ' legal ' and not the 14 yo that was taken from her village in honduras and fed drugs to make her malleable . \ > there 's so many stories of men ( and some women ) knowing rightly that the prostitute was underage or unwilling but they still follow through with it . those people in my opinion are just as much a rapist as those who drag strangers in a dark alley , and they should be arrested . in the eyes of the law as well and these people would be criminals even if prostitution was legal . ok , first , you say that you have this position because of the women and children who are exploited and forced to prostitute themselves . the nordic model does nothing at all to reduce prostitution compared to the model that criminalizes selling sex as well as buying it , and it does nothing at all to reduce the likelihood of women being trafficked and forced to have sex for money . if that is your real worry , then i think you should support legalizing prostitution but regulating it . a legal , regulated prostitution system would allow clients of prostitution to know that the providers they meet are fully consenting adults , and it would make both clients and sex workers more likely to go to the police to report suspicious prostitution of women that are likely to be trafficked , because they know it would n't run the risk of them being arrested for their own sexual activities . it would also enable prostitutes to work in safer conditions , to protect them in the case that their clients are violent . furthermore , having accessible legal access to prostitution would dry up most of the demand for exploitative forms of prostitution , these pimps and prostitutes would be forced to undercut the legal market , making their work less profitable , and therefore reducing the financial incentives of the exploitative market . i 'll point out that when i read about sweden 's sex work regulations a few years back , swedish sex workers were almost universally opposed to the nordic model , that they called even worse than before , saying that it made them feel even less safe . the reaction from feminist proponents of the model was basically to accuse sex workers of being "" gender traitors "" and that them being beaten or killed was worth it to stop them from hurting the dignity of all women as a social class . if you want to make a moral argument that sex work is bad ... then should pornography be banned as well ? the main difference between sex work and pornography is the presence of a camera filming the action , people are still being paid in exchange for sex . illegal activities ( like human trafficking ) flourish the most in the black market . if you are already operating a brothel , human trafficking poses less additional risk since you are already a criminal . if you are operating a legal brothel , there is much greater incremental risk to using trafficked people . if it 's legal you can just call the cops , work in a brothel with private security or join a union instead of having a criminal protecting you . and also if the police stop wasting resources trying to catch consenting adults having sex they would have more resources to spend on fighting human trafficing and other real problems . not a lot of people are going to buy a prostitute who hardly speaks english from a shady guy when there is a perfectly legal , clean and safe brothel 10 minutes away . i mean saying prostitution should be illegal because there is human trafficing is like saying consensual employment should be illegal because there is slavery . this suggests that the person paying for the affections is not a victim but the person charging for it is . on the seller side women will continue to be pimped under the guise of being organized and protected . it is done by a sex worker , and she explains the issues with different types of prostitution laws . why not make prostitution legal but make it so that it is regulated and they need licenses and such , to avoid a having prostitutes be exploited . the nordic model has its issues too , it 's one of those things that works better in theory than in practice . i agree it would be better for the victims but itd be better to legalize both ends . nobody owns your body , you should be able to sell and enter into mutual agreements with other adults without other people dictating what you cant do at least completely criminalizing it has some sense to it if you say this is to stop sex slavery but the nordic model does n't stop sex slavery any more than just completely making it illegal because a sex slave is already not committing any crimes because an element of the crime is obviously volition and intent . the nordic model has no argument beyond sexual moralism of "" we think it 's immoral that you go out and purchase sex as a product with your own money . - is hated by the prostitutes : of course it is ; what producer does not hate it when buying their product is illegal ? - is hated by the clients : of course it is ; what client of a products wants buying the product to be illegal ? - maybe it 's liked by the sex slaves more than making it fully legal but it does not benefit the sex slaves more than fully illegality in any way . so the nordic model has no advantage above symmetric legality or illegality aside from being able to preach your sexual morality of "" you are a bad bad bad bad person for going out and purchasing sex with your own money from someone who is willing to sell you sex to obtain that money in an agreement all parties consented to . "" of course — i have no doubt in my mind that fully symmetric illegality is also just based on sexual morality and the "" we think this is the best approach to stop sex slavery "" is just reaching for an argument but at least they managed to find an argument with their reaching ; the asymmetric illegality has no argument whatsoever beyond sexual authoritarianism . as i said in my original post the nordic model does nothing against that in favour of full symmetric illegality . why should it be illegal for two or more consenting adults to enter into an agreement where one or more provides a service for an agreed upon price ? sweden punishes sex workers , but it does n't punish them with jail or fines . it 's illegal for sex workers to work together to save costs or for self-protection . landlords who rent to sex workers can have their property seized , which means that sex workers can be evicted simply for being sex workers . sex workers can be denied services that they should be entitled to as swedish citizens . it is not True that sex workers are not punished by the swedish state . so in general , the "" nordic model "" punishes sex workers for being sex workers , it just does n't imprison them . the swedish government has issued two reports that tried to show reductions in sex work and trafficking , but the reports were poorly done and had no reliable evidence to support them . there 's been a shift in how sex workers and clients found each other ( less street sex work ) , but no one knows if overall sex work increased , decreased , or stayed the same . the first , and most easily refuted , is that sex trafficking is a huge international illegal business , third in size behind drug and gun trafficking . the other argument is that any amount of sex trafficking is too much . i have a friend who was forced into sex work as a young woman , and i agree that any amount of sex trafficking is too much . but that 's not an argument against prostitution or sex work . there are any number of sex workers who have stated that they chose sex work and were not trafficked . for many poor people , the "" safety net "" consists of small time drug dealing , petty theft , and sex work . if you eliminate sex work , you force sex workers into drug dealing and petty theft . paul ryan , the outgoing speaker of the house , spent years trying to eliminate snap , the food stamp program . had he succeeded , he would have forced a lot more women onto the streets to feed their children . so realistically , sex work is what we 're offering sex workers . if we eliminate sex work , we 'll force them into things that they hate more than they hate sex work . single mothers who 's food stamps run out before the end of the month do n't go to mcdonalds to make up the difference . they hit the strolls where they can earn more money faster , and they can choose their working hours so they have less problem with child care . people supporting drug addictions do n't get jobs at mcdonalds , they hit the strolls where they can earn money immediately for the fix they need now . people who ca n't afford market rent do n't get jobs at mcdonalds because it does n't pay enough to cover market rent . there are people with jobs in the regular economy who are n't earning enough to cover rent , so they hit the strolls a couple of nights a week to avoid becoming homeless . mcdonalds and similar low paying service jobs are part of the reason so many people are doing sex work . obviously , the op is using the term "" prostitute "" to mean street based sex workers . but she 's obviously talking about the minority of sex workers who are poor . generally , the biggest problems facing poor sex workers are the problems of poverty . if you look at the epidemiology studies for stds , high rates of stis are associated with certain income levels and certain geographical areas , but are n't necessarily associated with sex work . this is very complicated and there 's limited data , but specific populations have high rates of stis , regardless of whether the people in the population are sex workers or not . this extends to the other things the op listed . these are all associated with certain populations , regardless of sex work . the op 's argument is a bit incoherent , but they seem to be arguing that legalizing sex work wo n't change this . decriminalizing sex work in new zealand has led to better cooperation between sex workers and police , and as sex workers have gradually come to trust the legal system , they started taking advantage of their legal rights and bringing their cases to court . under the "" nordic model "" , sex workers are still punished and stigmatized . decriminalizing sex work wo n't decriminalize trafficking , or decriminalize forcing people into sex work . "" pimp "" can mean anything from so called "" guerrilla "" pimps who control women with violence , to men who handle negotiations with clients and provide a modicum of protection services , to a boyfriend who stay home and takes care of the kids , to spot pimps who refer clients to sex workers and collect a commission , but otherwise have no dealings with the sex worker . it can be someone who runs a brothel or agency , and it can refer to either a man or woman . a man hired by an escort as a bodyguard/driver may be described as a pimp by the police . "" pimp "" can cover a lot of very different jobs , and different power relationships between "" pimp "" and sex worker . there 's no reason we ca n't decriminalize sex work and pass laws criminalizing the exploitation of sex workers . or , more specifically , we should legalize consensual prostitution while keeping non-consensual prostitution illegal . when people want to buy sex , they do n't have any reputable sources to buy from . they 're forced to buy sex from seedy sources who conduct business in secret . customers are at risk of having sex with minors , people who are being forced into sex , or people who are infected with stds . we can require all customers to be tested for stds as well as make sure prostitutes are regularly tested as well . we can open the doors to women who want to make a living having sex without them having to work for seedy individuals . all we 'll be doing is keeping one form of prostitution illegal while a consensual form of prostitution is made legal . it would also be beneficial to legalize prostitution because it would allow law enforcement to focus on illegal prostitution that is non-consensual or uses minors . if law enforcement is trying to bust prostitutes who are over 18 and working consensually , then they 're not using those resources to crack down on non-consensual prostitution . if you think we should regulate alcohol while keeping prostitution illegal , i want you to really think hard about why you are okay with legalized alcohol but not cool with prostitution being legal . but you should draw a line between forced prostitution and willing prostitution , just like you should draw a line between forced labor ( people trafficked into being factory workers , farm workers , house cleaners , etc ) and willing labor . should joining the military be illegal because it might be the only answer for some people and there 's a risk of dying ( fairly low , but higher than other jobs ) , injury ( very high , especially in permanent hearing damage and permanent back problems , which does n't even touch on things like agent orange and the effects of being around depleted uranium ) , rape , alcohol addiction , etc ? legal prostitution can drive out illegal prostitution through market forces . also , you 'll need to provide sources , because prostitutes can still be victims of rape just like non-prostitute sexually active people can be victims of rape . your understanding of legalized prostitution does n’t fit all situations , australian prostitution is all ( legally ) done in state run brothels , to protect the workers , and it cuts out the pimp ."
9x9scg,"diversity hires are racist just made this throwaway account to express my opinion and to try to solidify it . a few years back ( 2014 ) google was under a lot of scrutiny by the media for not having a diverse group of workers . they had an extreme majority of white males working there at the time which made the media to accuse them of being racist/sexist . it caused a huge uproar at the time and google decided to make some changes to their hiring process . they created a race/sex quota for their employee hires . like for example , they 'd need at least 100 mexican workers or something . this was meant to help minorities get jobs while also making google viewed in a better light to the public . but the problem is it started hurting white men who were applying to these jobs ; even if they had more skill than a minority person applying to the same job . i was wondering if you thought this was being racist towards white people or not . also if you think it is racist , is it justified . & #x200b ; i for one would love to see minorities and women better represented in the tech industry . however , i do n't think it 's right to bring one group down to bring others up . & #x200b ; i think it 's a little racist . you 're judging a person by their skin colour and saying that they 're not as "" valuable "" as a minority . i can completely understand the need for diversity in work . and as a person of colour , i 'd love to see more people like me in my field . but i do n't think rejecting white men ( because that 's the majority ) is the answer . i think it 's more important to try to develop society to have more minorities and women try to pursue these types of careers instead . but that 's a slow process and for the tons of people who are minorities/women aiming for these jobs before these changes occur , will get fucked . i 'm so conflicted at the moment but i 'm sure you can tell i 'm leaning a bit more towards "" it 's racist "" and "" it 's not justified "" side . & #x200b ; was wondering what other solutions people had as well .","let 's suggest to do that we need to have diversity hires to achieve this . this allows people who may not have competitively got into a job because their background was n't encouraging the industry or career and they maybe did n't have all the factors and support network needed to beat the majority white guy at interview . factors of their historic social background made it harder for them ( potentially ) . i believe 100 % that over time this will equalise us as a society and can be used as a method in other cases . we will need to invest in this minority hire . they got in potentially off a factor outside of their overall competence for the job . it would also hurt majority people who lost a job due to colour . i feel if your goal is to change the profile in jobs or other places then you will always be racist or sexist . i do feel however that rather than force change we should consistently push the idea that everyone is equal , all rights are shared and we should have the same opportunities . rather than simply looking for a black man or a gay woman , we should look at what the person has accomplished and what their marginalized identity means in relation to that . a black or gay man that fought through adversity and built a career is a very different thing . their diversity is not a superficial thing , but a meaningful part of their identity . that diversity hiring is counter productive to the company 's ultimate goals ; that diversity hiring is objectively unfair to highly qualified people ; and you 've said "" you 're judging a person by their skin colour and saying that they 're not as "" valuable "" as a minority . "" however , i do n't believe that it 's actually motivated by racial hatred . one is that i disagree that there 's a straightforward way to rank candidates ( this white man is definitely more qualified than a black woman , but we will hire her instead because she ticks the boxes ) . in contrast , i believe that increased diversity is a huge benefit , not just for visibility or even societal good , but that it actually benefits your business . the ketchup problem is a good example of what i 'm talking about ( i really recommend reading about that , they do a much better job explaining than i do ) . my other thought is that the kind of traditional metrics that are used when evaluating candidates do not tell the full story . sure , you might have a white man who appears more qualified : he went to a better college , had an internship at a more famous company , that kind of thing . but it 's important to remember that there are so many systems in place that help certain kinds of people succeed . if a white man from a fairly affluent family goes to good schools from a young age , he 'll have so many advantages : a school that teaches coding , no need for an after school job , teachers who look at him and think of him as someone who could definitely succeed . when he applies for college , he 'll have a heads up in being accepted if he went to a better high school , has connections , his family is able to pay full tuition , he is exposed to people who are very knowledgeable about the college application process . he 'll have time to do prestigious unpaid internships . if he comes from a family with connections , he 'll be even better situated to find prestigious jobs and internships -- those connections are way more important than your application . if the kid is anything other than a white man , he grows up thinking of business and tech as industries that are n't necessarily "" meant "" for him , that he does n't look like the typical startup guy . it 's not as easy to assume you 'll be able to work in a place like that . maybe he has to work a job during high school , which can have an impact on grades and opportunity for outside learning . it 'll be harder to get into a good college , and harder to pay for it . he wo n't necessarily have connections in the industry , which will make the internships hard to get -- not to mention that he may be working to get through college and not as able to take on an unpaid internship . maybe he graduates and needs to find a job right away , because he is n't getting financial support from his parents , so he takes the first thing he can find instead of taking time off to network , maybe do another internship , maybe go to business school ... i am definitely not saying that all white men are like the first example , and all black men are like the second example . and if the person in the second example shows that he is a quick , independent learner , and an interesting thinker , he may be a more promising candidate . then there 's no racism in hiring a black person instead of a white person to help diversity because it 's not because the black person is supposed to be different ( in better or worse ) but to try to achieve a more equal society . what you can say however is that it 's discrimination ( the unjust or prejudicial treatment of different categories of people , especially on the grounds of race , age , or sex ) to that we can just say that indeed it is and that 's why it 's even called ' positive discrimination ' so maybe the view you want to be challengedis : "" i think that positive discrimination is not good "" ( and you should edit your post ) but diversity hire is n't racist because it 's not the right word since there 's absolutely no notion of a race being better or worse than another in that process . your view is premised on the ideas that 1 ) True "" merit "" is measurable , and measurable enough by humans that 2 ) it is apparent in job applications and interviews , and 3 ) "" merit "" never includes diversity of upbringing or perspective . that is n't the case and a lot of people have a problem understanding this because they think if a boss or a manager does n't hate black people , women , etc. / does n't thinks they are incompetent or less capable he will not disadvantag someone . the reason is we like people that are like us and that 's why we favor them . they do n't think "" this black woman will make a bad hire . "" they think "" that male , white guy in his 20s reminds me of myself in his age and i 'm a great guy ! "" so , the decision google ( or any other company ) has done is about having a better coder vs having a good coder and improving their image . - ignore the fact that diversity hires are specifically an attempt to correct for past and existing racist practices . this is n't at all True . they set goals for percentages they wanted to work towards . they 've made almost no progress ( they have more women but minorities still are n't applying for google jobs ) mainly because among minorities in the field they have a terrible reputation as being a hostile work environment ( which is actually the reason for this whole diversity plan , they have a lawsuit for discriminating against women stemming from back around 2014 ) . google is well below industry average in hiring minorities and women and according to minorities and women that work or worked at google its because google is a hostile work environment . i know a black man that worked for google and one that turned down a position with them . heard the same thing from both of them which is that google is n't the place to be if you want a nice work environment . i mean obviously if google hired by nothing but merit 90 % of the workforce being white/asian does n't make sense . affirmative action is usually only applied to a small number of jobs . that means that overall , members of the white/male/straight / able-bodied majorities still have much better chances overall of getting all the other jobs in the job market . an organization that is more diverse can be more flexible and agile when it is developing strategies for its target market , or product development , etc . for example , a company that puts out a "" racist "" or "" racially insensitive "" ad , it is usually not surprising to see only whites were involved in the ad 's creation process . they just did n't have the cultural perspective of a different ethnicity , and therefore were not able to perceive how to best target it or at least not be offensive to it . also hr departments of organizations have to be honest with themselves on what are the essential qualifications for a position they are hiring for . when interviewing for a position , you will likely have multiple people who meet the essential qualifications of the job . at that point it becomes on what criteria do you select the "" best ? "" this is never a straight forward answer , as candidates are usually judged on a variety of qualitative characteristics that are difficult to correlate directly to job performance . it has been my experience that "" white "" people normally win out in situations like this , because it is human nature to pick someone whom you are familiar with and comfortable with , than let 's say a foreigner , who has a strong accent , is from a different religion , does n't like the same extracurricular activities as you or the rest of your already "" very white "" organization . of course this decision is never reached consciously as a racist one ( i.e. "" i 'm going to pick the white guy "" ) , and justifications that are normally put forward include "" they just interviewed better , "" "" they just will fit in better with the rest of the team , "" etc . and so the advantages of diversity is sacrificed for greater team cohesion . this is why organizations like google are trying to embrace and encourage diversity , so that they can gain its advantages while still maintaining cohesive teams that work well together despite their individual differences ."
9x4w9q,"it is morally inconsistent to say that paedophiles are pre-destined to molest children but also demand that they are held to account for their actions . i have come across the argument again and again that all paedophiles molest children . the basis for this is a belief that if someone is sexually attracted to children , then of course they would sexually abuse children . this view deprives paedophiles of moral agency . after all , a paedophile with moral agency could simply choose not to molest children , despite their desires to . in a world where paedophiles are moral agents able to decide not to molest children , the view that all paedophiles molest children can not be True . & #x200b ; this means that the people who hold the view that paedophiles all molest children must hold the view that paedophiles do not have any moral agency over their behaviour . that they must not know the difference between right and wrong . given that we do not prosecute people for crimes if they are found to not understand the difference between right and wrong , it would be morally inconsistent for the people who hold the view that paedophiles all molest children to argue that paedophiles should face criminal prosecution for their behaviour . & #x200b ; & #x200b ;","it 's wrong to treat any pedophile like a sexual predator but we typically only hear of the ones who do commit such a crime , meaning that most pedophiles in life that we see are the ones already figured out . it 's less a position of whether they should be held accountable , and more a position that they should be held preemptively accountable and that locking them all up before they got to do anything would solve the problem . there is n't any hypocrisy in that feeling , because if you believe honestly that all pedophiles are just waiting for an opportunity to strike , then it 's just preventative . so we judge people based on their actions and do not judge people based on their feelings . maybe deserving of pity . acting on those feelings is horrible , and deserving of jail time . first , i do n't think many people say pedophiles ca n't help but rape a kid some day . say i grant the premise that the pedophile ca n't help it . i still have to put him in jail , otherwise he 'll stay free and continue to rape kids . even if it 's not his fault he rapes kids ( a dubious premise ) , we still have to lock him up for the safety of the kids . option 1 : pedophiles have moral agency therefore they are not-predestined to molest children therefore society must punish them for choosing to do so by putting them in jail . option 2 : pedophiles do not have moral agency therefore they are predestined to molest children therefore society must put them in jail to prevent them from molesting children . the tiger would be held accountable for its actions , even if it has no voluntary control over them . we hold lots of people accountable with diminished mental capacities . it 's consistent if jail is the best way to keep them away from kids . in that case , jail keeps pedophiles from offending while also deterring non-pedophiles who might otherwise pose as pedophiles if caught molesting children to avoid punishment . the initial argument that you 've come across is backwards : pedophiles do n't always molest children , but all people found guilty of sexually abusing children are pedophiles . if a pedophile acted upon his desires and molested a child , he or she should be held accountable and be thrown in jail . especially if it can be proven that the offender was aware that his or her actions were morally wrong , harmful , and illegal . pedophiles who lack impulse control can argue mental illness , but they are still found guilty by reason of insanity . my assumption is that "" held to account for their actions "" means prison , correct me if i 'm wrong . that is to say , someone needs to see real consequences enacted on others to inhibit their behavior . while you cover a portion of this with the idea of a non-active pedophile , you would have trouble arguing that all non-active pedophiles refrain from action due to moral agency alone , some are frightened of the consequences of law and punishment . - harm reduction : whether it 's in the pedophile nature or not , there are victims that should be protected . i think it would be immoral to put a child in a tiger 's cage at the zoo , while accepting it 's in the nature of the tiger to sometimes hunt and eat people , or possibly accidentally kill the child when inspecting it . you can simultaneously hold that it 's in their nature , while still advocating for being accountable for actions by accepting punishment and societal sequestering . it may be morally inconsistent to say that people are pre-destined to do bad things and punish them , but punishment is not the only reason to hold people accountable for their actions . we might also hold people accountable for their actions as policy to dis-incentive behavior . that 's perfectly consistent with a deterministic view of the world -- after all , the legal system is a meaningful part of the environment that would "" determine "" any given behavior . as discussed in other comments here , we might still lock someone up that we deem a risk to society , like some mass murderer who was bat-shit crazy and had no idea that killing people was wrong . as i understand if from my brief study of criminology , we incarcerate for reasons of retribution ( punishment ) , reparation ( to pay back the debt to society ) , rehabilitation , deterrence and restraint ( protect society from them ) . suppose we deemed that a certain person had no choice but to offend , could not be rehabilitated , and did not deserve punishment because they were not morally culpable . but the main point i would make is that you are absolutely right that people who are sexually attracted to children are in no way forced to sexually assault them . i am , and have been , sexually attracted to loads of people with whom it would not be moral to have sex , and so i do n't have sex with them . people who say that anyone who is sexually attracted to children will necessarily offend is just wrong . but there is a strong culture these days of avoiding moral responsibility in sexual matters ( ' the heart wants what the heart wants ' ) and then there 's the stupid argument that because a person is ' born gay ' that they have to have homosexual relations . ( i 'm not arguing that there 's anything wrong with homosexual relations , just that the argument "" that desire necessarily leads to behavior "" does n't hold . i have a friend who is gay ( he calls it ' same-sex-attracted ' ) who does not engage in homosexual relations for moral reasons . i think your main point is that it is stupid to argue "" that anyone who is sexually attracted to children will necessarily offend "" . i 'll bet there are heaps of people attracted to children who do n't offend ."
9x3xqk,"it should be illegal for companies to discriminate against protected classes with their pricing essentially , i do n’t think that it should be legal for a company to adjust the price you pay for their services based on your protected class status . i can think of at least two common examples of this . hair salons often charge different amounts for a men ’s haircut vs. a women ’s haircut ( typically women ’s cuts cost more ) . i do n’t think this should be legal . i understand that long hair is more work to cut than short hair , but it ’s not like all women have long hair and all men have short hair . it would make much more sense to just have a “ long hair ” and “ short hair ” price than to base it off gender . another example is nightclubs . many nightclubs charge a reduced cover fee for women compared to men . with this one , i understand that they do it because it evens out the gender ratio and makes the club more money , but i still do n’t think it ’s right . to me , it seems very similar to a club charging more for black people because they want to bring in more whites as high paying customers . just because it makes the business more money does n’t make it right . that ’s basically it . not sure what would change my view exactly but arguments along the lines of “ it ’s good for business ” probably wo n’t . cmv !","you have a point with nightclubs , and they have been sued in numerous states about this . but most states allow you to give discounts as you wish to attract certain clientele , even when that discount is based on protected class . this is why movies and meals are often cheaper for children under 10 , why senior discounts exist , and why clubs will give discounts to women to get them into the building . i 'm pretty sure most salons are moving away from "" men 's hair vs women 's hair "" and towards "" long hair vs short hair "" and charging for additional services performed such as coloring , extensions , styling , etc . technically , clubs are n't charging men any more than they normally would on ladies nights , they 're just charging women less . do you think that companies which are trying to sell clothes to black people should be required to use models with a variety of races in their advertising ? ( or maybe you think that companies should n't be allowed to target demographics based on protected group membership in the first place ? ) at some point , there was a push to make ' discrimination ' into a dirty word , but the fact is , that differences in the way that people are can justify differences in the way that we treat them , even when those differences are related to membership in protected classes . it 's one thing for hiring practices to be unfair , but nightclubs and hair salons have competition . let 's say a hair salon introduced a flat rate - if a men 's cut is $ 20 and women 's is $ 30 then let 's say all their cuts are $ 25 . well men are n't going to go there since it 's now more expensive and it 's going to be loaded with women getting what should be a $ 30 hair cut for $ 25 , so they 'd be making less money . nightclubs do ladies ' night because it brings in more men as well . men are going to want to go where women are . women typically pay more for products than men simply because the product is a feminine color . i understand that certain things cost women more because they are "" pretty "" or decorative or have a nice scent . every time i go to wal-mart i scoff when i see blue inked pens in pink packaging that cost more than the same ones in regular packaging . a woman who just asks for a trim will get charged the same amount as a guy who just wants a trim regardless of how long their hair is . the figure you 're citing does not compare that women typically get more done than just cutting split ends . in my personal experience ( i do n't go to chain hair dressers ) the stylists charge based on what they do . woman with a simple short hair style , "" mens haircut "" price . man with long hair wants simple hair cut , "" mens haircut "" price . man with long lustrous laborious locks , "" women 's haircut and style "" price . i 'm a dude with long hair and my trips to the salon amount to trimming off my split ends and doing a tiny bit of maintenance . women with long hair will typically do more than that , like getting layers , working with their bangs , or other things . it really is more work to do the typical hair of a long-haired woman than it is to do mine , and as such charging more makes perfect sense . if a woman only got a little trim up , however , i would agree that it would n't merit a higher price . with nightclubs , i do n't see any harm being done here -- the girls are likely happy to pay less and the guys are likely happy to have more of the fairer sex around . i get the male/female thing and the club may say there is a benefit to even mix . but what if the club showed their is a benefit to an even mix of black and white patrons . except that racism has more of a history of discrimination in nightclubs and social clubs , i do n't see why the male/female distinction should be treated that much differently , even if it is n't as extreme as the white/black disctinction . of course , we should treat people as individuals , and people die at all ages - but age is the biggest factor in pricing life insurance . the hair example - they can point out that "" on average "" there is a clear difference in the amount of time spent on women 's hair vs men 's . in other words , if they charge a price based on length or each service , some women may end up paying even more . summary - my point is simply - you can not and should not have a blanket rule that says all price discrimination that uses protected class distinctions as a factor should be illegal ."

"" the faux meat industry has grown from selling a handful of low-quality unappetizing product to a huge range of high-quality plant-based meats . vegan substitute companies like beyond meat and hampton creek are attracting huge investors like bill gates . even major fast-food and restaurant chains tout the fact that they have vegetarian and vegan options . taco bell regularly advertises their meat-free options and the fact that they have menu items certified by the american vegetarian association . fast-casual burrito chains like chipotle , pancheros , and moe 's have begun offering sauteed or grilled tofu as a protein option right alongside their meat options . even white castle has had a vegan burger on their menu ( link2 ) , and white castle have recently rolled-out impossible sliders to all of their locations . the pizza chains mod pizza , blaze pizza and & pizza offer a vegan cheese option for every pizza . most other chains have made an effort to include at least a few vegan or vegetarian options on the menu , even if it 's just a simple veggie burger . there have even been some completely vegan chain restaurants emerge with locations around the us , like native foods and veggie grill . u.s. vegetarian food sales , which is a category that includes things like soy milk and faux meat and not simply produce , doubled between 1998 and 2003 . in 2016 , tyson foods ( one of the largest players in the meat industry in the world ) announced that they are investing in plant-based meat-alternatives , and bought stake in a vegan meat company . in 2018 , when asked why they invested in beyond meat , a spokesperson for tyson said : "" we are a consumer products group and we sell delicious food to people all around the world , and as consumer 's preferences change and diets change , it 's our responsibility to go where the customers are going to be . "" in the uk , the rate of veganism has gone up by over 360 % over the past decade , and vegan food sales have risen by 1500 % in the last year . in 2017 , canadian meat-producer maple leaf foods bought a stake in lightlife foods , a company that produces plant-based vegan meat products , due to the increased demand for these types of products . later in the year , they bought field roast , another company specializing in plant-based meats and cheeses . marketwired reports , “ growth of alternative protein sources is poised to accelerate , potentially claiming up to a third of the protein market by 2054 , profoundly affecting agriculture , food technology , and end products , according to lux research . ” in 2017 , cargill , the largest privately held food and agriculture company in the world and one of the largest beef producers in the us , sold off its feedlot operations to divert funds to expand into other protein options , including plant-based proteins . in 2017 , at a dairy industry conference in chicago , the ceo of select milk producers said "" i think the threat is very serious , "" in reference to plant-based milks taking market share away from conventional dairy-based milk . 2017 , tgi fridays restaurants started offering the plant-based "" beyond burger "" at all of its locations . 2017 , pizza hut starts offering vegan cheese at all of their uk locations . 2017 , baum & whiteman food & restaurant consultants identified plant-based ( vegan ) food as the # 1 trend for the industry to plan for in 2018 . it 's clear that the millions and millions of vegetarians and vegans in the world have made a difference . i can not stop animal cruelty , but that does not mean i should partake in it . but the only way to arrive at a large localized effort is to have people commit to a cause even at a time when they are in the minority . a large localized effort has never and will never arise out of a vacuum . if for example you have 4 people , 3 who do n't care about the colors of balls and 1 only liking blue balls ( with an hate of other color ) , the ball seller will start to only sell only blue balls because everyone want blue balls , while it 's useless to propose other balls . initial situation : not every pizzeria propose a vegan pizza because not everybody cares about vegans and veganism every pizzeria starts to have a vegan pizza , because when a group of 15 friends with 1 vegan have to chose a pizzeria , they may check if the vegan guy will have something he is willing to eat the number of vegan pizzas will increase , for the same reason you may have different pizzas that are quite similar in a same menu . non-vegan people will start to eat vegan pizzas , because they are more present on the menu and they might even be good ( and marketed as different pizzas , not just the one "" vegan pizza "" ) - > the consumption of animal-based food will slightly reduce people will more easily transition from non-vegan to vegan because they already have vegan food that suit them"

9x1riq,"poor people must have the choice to be poor , otherwise they are inherently inferior poverty is often seen as a state that people are stuck in , not a choice . the argument of "" poor people are poor because they choose to keep being poor "" is typically countered by "" people do n't want to be poor , they are stuck being poor . "" the former suggests that people have the choice and ability to bring themselves up out of poverty . the latter suggests that people who are poor are simply stuck being poor and they will never be able to lift themselves out of it unless other people help them . in my view , this boils down to two schools of thought : people have the ability to choose what they do or people do n't have the ability to choose what they do . one might think this to be a matter of free-will vs determinism . in my view , this is a matter of inherent characteristics . if the choice to be poor is removed from an individual , their state of poverty must be attributed to inherent characteristics . in the same way that a person can not choose the biological factors that determine their height ( malnourishment aside ) , poor people , as the argument goes , can not choose the factors that have made them poor . this is complicated by that fact that there are people who are not poor and there are people who were once poor who are no longer poor . if people ca n't choose to be poor , then rich people ca n't choose to be rich . it seems a lowly endeavor to belittle someone for their inherent characteristics . this is how racism and other forms of discrimination take hold : by thinking less of someone for their inherent characteristics . if being poor is not a choice , then there is something about poor people that makes them inherently inferior to people who are not poor . poverty is not just a social construct ; it directly relates to one 's ability to survive and flourish and being poor is inferior to not being poor . thereby , helping people who are poor is a useless endeavor -- if they do n't consciously make the choice to be poor , they ca n't make the choice to not be poor . thus , any attempt to help them out of their poverty will result in them inevitably falling back into poverty because they do n't have a choice . i think the prevailing sentiment ( "" we should help the poor "" ) would disagree with this conclusion , but by disagreeing , would concede that people do in fact have the choice to not be poor which means they also have the choice to be poor . in conclusion , people must have the choice to ( not ) be poor , otherwise helping them is a useless endeavor because they possess inherent characteristics that make them poor . cmv .","the factory that employs 40 % of your town shuts down . none of these describe something that is inherent or would yield you to make any conclusions about inferiority of the person . let 's stipulate that people would prefer not to be poor . that means that either ( 1 ) the systems and structures that govern our society are fair and meritocratic , and the people who are poor are unable to rise out of poverty for reasons related to their skills , intelligence , determination , etc , or ( 2 ) the systems and structures that govern our society are not fair and meritocratic , and lots of poor people have crummy lives in spite of their intelligence , determination , promise , etc . a poor person is poor because they do not own property . that has nothing to do with inherent characteristics since ownership of property is not inherent . but neither is it something that the poor person can choose : a poor person can not just go up to a piece of property , say "" i choose to own this , "" and then own it . when a poor person stops being poor , it is because they now own property they did not previously own . the only way this happens is for other people who own that property to give their property to the ( formerly ) poor person . that 's not the poor person 's choice ; that 's the choice of the original property owner . a rich person , on the other hand , can choose to be rich , because they if the world gave everyone the same starting point i would agree with you but the world does not give everyone the same opportunities . suddenly the main employer in town leaves and there is zero demand for housing and fewer good jobs . if you stay you have your house and support structures but fewer economic opportunities . so you decide to stay in your house but make less money vs move out of town , lose money on your house , but possible earn more salary . there are the choices people make , internal characteristics , and external characteristics . external characteristics are essentially the outside world : everything a person neither chooses nor is born with , like their environment and the effects of chance . a person 's innate capabilities make escaping poverty easier or more difficult . some people make poor choices that keep them in poverty . and some people are held back by bad luck , like the the failure of a business for unforeseeable reasons . people can not choose their biological factors ( which includes intelligence ) and thus do not choose to be poor ( as income is highly correlated with intelligence ) . i mean my accent is an objective fact that a ) i did n't choose and b ) is n't inherent to me as a person . the idea with stuck , is that most people , in those circumstances would also get stuck . the us does a very poor job at maintaining any sort of mobility , from the bottom up especially . between more study time ( helps with grades ) , family wealth being able to afford things like tutors and test prep classes , and - a really big one that makes a huge difference - legacy admissions giving a huge boost to rich , predominantly white families , there are just a lot more boosts to help out a rich kid than a poor one , who likely will have to work through high school , has less time to study , and may be the first in their family to even go to college . there are a lot of barriers to economic mobility , which make it harder for the poor to move upwards . these are external , so they arent choice based , but they arent an inherent flaw in the poor person either . you can spend time and money to give you + modifier on the roll but its ’s still a roll . people ca n't choose the color of their skin , but does that make it inherently inferior to have darker or lighter skin ? poor people do not necessarily choose to be poor , there are many circumstances that cause some people to be at a financial disadvantage . even if people who are poor have the drive , passion , and work ethic , they could remain poor based on the amount of agency they are given . people who are poor and marginalized in society are not given the same opportunities to earn money as those who are better off the begin with . if someone runs up and sucker punches you , you did n't choose to get punched , but there 's also nothing inherent to you that made you get punched . i did n't choose the city i was born in , but i can change the city i live in , for example . the poor who are both hard working and lucky can escape poverty . if all the poor became overnight twice as industrious , either the system would realign itself so most of them would remain poor , or else the system would break down , because there would be no one to drive the trucks and mow the fields and run the factories . what if the fact of a person being poor is n't up to the poor person at all , either by way of choice or by way of inherent capacity ? you note that people have some upward mobility , indicating there is some capacity to leave poorness that is n't limited by society , but this has several possible explanations , likely a combination of all of them . first , upwardly mobile people could be exceptional . this would mean that the lack of upward mobility of some poor people would be an inherent characteristic , but that characteristic would be normality . any or all of these can give some poor people non-inherent advantages over others . incarcerated people can not simply choose not to be poor . they are prevented from obtaining high paying jobs . they are not inherently inferior and can get a decent job simply by pardoning them . you 're speaking as though you either choose your situation or inherently can never escape from it , when there is so much more nuance and so many other factors . it 's like coming across someone who got shot and thinking "" hm , if he did n't choose to get shot , then he ca n't choose not to get shot . they are inherently stupid / weak / inferior and thus their poverty is justified , or they are actually very capable but simply chose to be poor ( something that i 'd argue would place them in the # 1 category anyway ) yet you neglect a third possibility , that they 're entirely capable and are being denied the opportunity to rise above their current state by some external force . slaves were arguably the poorest class of humans to ever exist , lacking not only money and wealth but even autonomy over their own bodies . this unjustifiably assumes that the system which renders them "" poor "" is inherently just and does not allow for questioning that system . unless you view sociopathy and the willingness to harm others for personal gain as inherently "" superior "" to honesty and diligence , i fail to see how this can accurately be categorized as a "" just "" system . did i not get that job because i was "" inferior , "" or because i was denied an opportunity that someone else would have had ? in your mind , does the person denying me the choice to work there have any culpability in my poverty , insofar as they could have given me an opportunity to work my way out of it ? a poor person can still choose to be rich or poor . you argument that if a poor person can not chose to become wealthy they are somehow inferior is a categorical mistake . nobody is saying given the option a poor person would n't chose to become wealthy . what people are saying is that more often than not they are not given the opportunity to select weather or not they get to choose in the first place ."
9x0xs7,"individuals can be effective in reducing carbon emissions by consuming less a common statistic i 've been seeing around the internet is that 100 companies are responsible for 71 % of global emissions ( source ) . often , i see this as a response to anyone who advocates actions that individuals take to reduce their carbon footprint . i believe that this implies that individuals have no culpability at stake when it comes to climate change . i think that this implication is wrong . here are some background beliefs : i think that most people in the middle class and up consume too much , and i believe that the incentive to consume so much comes from various capitalism related factors . ( i understand this might be a spicy view , but it is n't the one i necessarily want changed , but if that 's the root cause you want to target , there it is ) . i think that this artificial demand for goods and services does n't necessarily make people 's lives better , but does cause them to consume more than they need to . because of this , i believe that individuals can lead fulfilling lives while attempting to minimize their carbon footprint . i wanted to make this point because i think a common counterpoint to my main argument is that people are materialistic and that reducing consumption inherently makes one 's life worse ( or something to that effect ) . on to the main argument . i believe that an effective means for reducing carbon emissions is for individuals to reduce consumption . saying that corporations are responsible for 71 % of carbon emissions clouds the point that much of those emissions are in service to consumer demands . some vehicles on the road are personal cars , and some are commercial vehicles . individuals can reduce emissions by biking instead of driving personal cars . i think that the argument that i am fighting against makes the case that the amount of emissions from these personal vehicles is miniscule compared to that from commercial vehicles ( i 'm using this driving as a metaphor for all emissions , which might be folly ) and therefore biking instead of driving is worthless when fighting climate change . however , the commercial vehicles are out there for a reason . some of them are transporting goods , some are on the way to a destination to perform services . i argue that an individual who forgoes some unnecessary consumption would also reduce emissions because one of these commercial vehicles might be taken off the road . so the untouchable "" 71 % of emissions from companies "" is actually very touchable . i do think that it 's possible there is an entrenched percentage of emissions that will have to be dealt with by other means , but i think that untouchable amount is n't so high that personal action becomes irrelevant . due to all this , i believe one meaningful way to fight climate change is to "" change the culture "" of consumption and for individuals to claim some responsibility in companies ' carbon emissions . & #x200b ; note : my view is n't that this is the best or only way to prevent climate change , just that it is an option that should be promoted , especially because it just "" feels "" better because it comes from below and not from above . & #x200b ; thanks for reading ! change my view ! & #x200b ;","it 's not that individuals should n't change their behavior , it 's that the articles , pundits and leaders who advocate for only individual action are making the issue a matter of personal responsibility instead of systematic problems . when someone says "" do these 5 easy steps to reduce your footprint "" with no mention that the actual root cause of climate change is several steps removed from the individual , they will just shift the blame . it does n't matter if you bike instead of drive to work . furthermore making climate change an individual issue rather than a systemic one lessens support for systemic issues . solutions like emissions standards , carbon tax , public transportation investment will never have support if we are not recognizing the problem for what it is . basically individuals in first world countries can cut back on carbon emissions . even if we reduce at the individual level in first world countries , we 're still increasing carbon emissions rapidly on a global level due to the fact that there are just more people . so yes , an individual can make an impact ( i.e. be less bad ) . but all that 's really going to do is make the carbon emissions globally slightly less exponential . can we agree that objectively , no one individual 's consumption habits makes an observable effect in carbon emissions , even if at the same time , as a whole , individual consumption habits are entirely responsible for carbon emissions ? so although it is entirely within the individual 's capability to change , on average they will not , and until you enforce something to hold them responsible for their consumption , they never will . if you believe your impact can be marginal , and therefore effective in large enough numbers , consider the following : if you consume less , the price of things you consume ( like gas , meat , cigarettes , etc ) will be reduced marginally . if the price of these things goes down , people will choose to consume more of them . therefore , if you do have a marginal effect , then that effect will also lead others to change their behavior and will make up for your reduced consumption . voluntary behavior change can only work when the majority of the population agrees that they no longer value or need the thing you ’re avoiding . if people - other than you - still value it , your actions will have 0 impact . the only solution to this problem is a carbon tax , which i believe people should advocate for in place of voluntary behavior change ."
9wzuho,"wwi was a tragic but useless waste of human lives recently on armistice day a lot of world leaders talked about remembering the sacrifices made by the fallen soldiers . i do n’t want to diminish their suffering , but my understanding from history is that the only thing worth remembering about the war was how utterly pointless it was . millions of lives , years of war , kilometers destroyed . and no new freedoms were gained ( unlike say , us civil war ) , no human progress was made ( arguably , american and french revolution ) , no tyrants were deposed ( wwii , colonial wars ) . there were no good guys . the european map changed and indeed empires and dynasties fell , but they were more casualties of the war than any stated goal , no french enlisted because they wanted to end the ottoman empire or saying “ let ’s help our russians comrades overthrow the czar ” . these empires fell almost as a result of internal economic collapse after/during the war . maybe the only good outcome of the war was to show the world the utter madness of war at that scale and force governments to find other solutions . but even at that it failed , the league of nations did n’t guaranteed it was the war to end all wars . am i missing anything ? was the “ great war ” anything but a genocide committed by world leaders against their own people for selfish reasons ?","now , sure , the cost was way way way too high , and many other oppressive regimes remained , but the same can be said for wwii , where the west was helping one tyrant ( stalin ) while fighting another ( hitler ) . countries that until 1914 had dominated the world stage disappear . at the time the leaders could not have predicted just how many people would die . they honestly thought his would be like recent european wars and some land would change hands and it would only take a few months . they failed to realise the killing power/staying power that modern technology had given nations . look at wars before ww1 one-two big battles won and the war is over , one of the reasons nepolean failed in russia was him looking for the decisive battle to end the war . the implication here is that other wars were n't tragic and useless waste of lives . all wars are various levels tragic useless waste of lives . had ww1 been won by the by the central powers , all of africa and the middle east would have been dominated by the huge germany and ottoman empires . these empires would continued as before and have ruled these regions with an autocratic iron first suppressing nationalist movements throughout the 20th century until it became to costly in money and blood . british forces were able to liberate belgium from german rule , and prevented german domination of the european continent : two war-goals that were successfully achieved , and i would say were both likely worth joining the conflict . french and serbian forces were able to defend their nations from invading armies : i would say defense of your nation from conquering invaders was successfully accomplished , and worth fighting for , though the french did fail to achieve the goal of forever removing germany as a threat , but 30 years of peace and independence are n't nothing . american forces were able to put a stop to unrestricted submarine warfare in the atlantic : the defense of international shipping might be a bit of imbalance when compared to the costs of ww1 , but american involvement was n't until late , and their losses not too extreme , which helps balance against the relative smallness of their goal . the ottoman empire drastically changed as well , and the sultan position was removed years later . the mongols sacking of persia is progress made if your ideology is that more mongol rule is good and the way of the future , but it is a pointless slaughter if you 're of the ideology that persian rule is good and the way of the future . history is written by the victor , after the civil war the south had rules imposed onto them that the people did not want imposed onto them , rules that we can agree are morally good today but comparable to any ideology being imposed via war . there are no "" good guys "" in war , that 's propaganda . many people today would claim that the germans were the bad guys in ww2 , but you do realize that the common soldier and citizen were not involved in slaughtering civilians right , none of them thought "" we 're evil let 's beat these protagonists ! "" had they won , i 'm sure there 's parts of history they would have omitted and they would view themselves to be the good guys , especially since their propaganda for starting the war began with claims that ethnic germans were being attacked in czechoslovakia and poland . ww1 had no clear narrative , and ended inconclusively and could not have any narrative written around it other than "" pointless slaughter "" . i ’m not disputing the exceptional pointlessness of workd war i , but the war did produce change and results . old empires fell and new states formed ; power dynamics changed and society ’s perceptions of art and progress were forever altered . your question , however , seems to be more about the lack of any moral goals of the war or whether or not the nationalist and imperialist motives of the war justified the toll in human lives . the honest answer is that wars are n’t fought for moral principles . they are fought for power , countries ’ strategic interests , and sometimes irrational reasons such as personal interests . in other words , the moral aspect was less about the morality of the war and more about the senseless brutality displayed by the nazis and japanese . viewed in a different light , however , world war ii still follows the “ countries pursuing their interests ” model . the war was clearly not a crusade for freedom or democracy , for the despotic , totalitarian soviet union was a critical member of the coalition . my point is that this question of the “ point ” of war and whether or not countries ’ self interests are worth sacrificing lives for is not a question unique to world war i. i think it ’s not so much that world war i was pointless , but rather that our expectation that war has a “ point ” of promoting freedom or social progress is simply ill-founded ."
9wuhzq,"outrage over amazon hq locations is completely unjustified so i have been seeing a lot of posts on social media about how amazon is evil and that it is taking money from taxpayers or the government , but this misrepresents the situation entirely . i think that politicians have engaged in a strategy to misinform the public to manufacture anger and use it to their advantage . this is my outline of the process that is being used . ----------------------------------------------------------------- how to generate anger over amazon hqs step 1 : establish that the government is entitled to up to 100 % of revenue and that they are doing companies and individuals a favor by taking less step 2 : make the wild claim that amazon is not sensitive to costs , while simultaneously accusing them of being greedy and profit motivated step 3 : redefine the term tax break to include it in definition of a subsidy step 4 : convince everyone that amazon is taking taxpayer money , while ignoring the fact that they are providing tax revenue that did not exist before and are not receiving any tax money at all step 5 : convince locals that immigrants and non locals will get all the jobs and that 50000 jobs that did not exist before will not benefit the community step 6 : convince people that a net gain in tax revenue , gdp , and jobs is actually an overall loss it is one thing to be opposed to political pandering and brown-nosing as a rule . it is another thing to outright lie and change definitions to obfuscate the objective truth and make people angry . any penny that ny or dc makes off of amazon in hq is a net gain , and that implies that job creation and gdp increase has 0 value at all . if ny or dc did not offer tax breaks to amazon , they would not have opened there and the cities would gain nothing at all . looking at it as an overall loss by comparing the theoretical gains that could have been realized without providing these incentives is extremely backwards . ----------------------------------------------------------------- i would like to hear other perspectives , thoughts , criticisms , or takedowns of this view to challenge my biases and refine my position .","amazon 's pressure on city governments is forcing them to act like an anti-competitive monopoly , to lower prices where there is competition ( at times for a loss ) , while keeping prices higher on businesses that do n't have the flexibility to move . amazon and other companies might outright fail if they had to actually pay tax on certain aspects of their environment . instead , many either avoid or evade taxes or claim everything as growth and essentially not make a single dollar for tax purposes . places switch back and forth and in the end , nothing changes , save for the subsidies they get and the government money lost in the process . it 's the same thing for amazon . this is also based on a likely presumption that amazon knew where they were going before , and were either shopping around for a better deal anyway or were trying to leverage it in the places they wanted to go . do you think it 's possible that a given city/state/jurisdiction can give tax breaks that exceed the overall value of the "" addition "" of a company ? if amazon does n't come to town , something else will happen with those resources ( e.g. instead of amazon buying and developing those several blocks of long island city , some other company or companies will ) . there are many historical examples of corporations making such and such promises and then bailing on a town , incurring costs to taxpayers . it 's not altogether that much different from subsidized sport stadiums , which in many cases fail to make the promised economic impact . lastly , i think on a more general scale people are tired of corporations not paying their fair share of taxes . 50000 jobs will of course bring in many economic opportunities , but the local tax burden would only be shared among the workers and other small businesses . amazon benefits from all the local infrastructure and improvements while it 's workers are the ones paying for it out of their own paychecks ."
9wu40b,"the israel/palestine conflict could be resolved with legal peace for a one-state solution i saw a video recently , put out by middle ground and jubilee as part of youtube 's "" creators for change "" project , and it got me thinking about what i personally believe for the israel/palestine conflict . one of the guys in the video , holds onto and believes in the idf 's ideals , and he insists that the best solution is one-state under israel authority . please note , i 'm pretty uninformed about the history of this conflict . but this has awoken an interest in me , and i 'm at step one : realizing that i do at least believe a one-state solution would be better than walls and barriers . ( i do n't necessarily think it has to be under israel authority , but i 'm not sure either way what that authority should look like . ) for reference , here 's the video : "" can israelis and palestinians see eye to eye ? "" [ -- url -- )","why should the palestinians seek agreement with a state that uses white phosphorous gas and shoots innocent people on the border and says that the sniper deserves a medal , of takes over palistianian tv and replaces all channels with pornography , or shoots protesters and journalists . i ca n't be as brief , but i think i can convince you that the israelis are also obstacles to an amicable one state solution . although israel no longer occupies gaza , they still control it with a crippling embargo/blockade . so , given that we 're already experiencing the one state solution under israeli dominance ... how 's that going for the palestinian population ? but i will say that juridification of politics means people will use ' legal ' arguments to support a certain view ; this usually leads to cementing positions rather than having an open mind about reaching a solution to the conflict . for example , arguing that "" international law says x and therefor israel should do y "" would make a person try to defend that position ( or the counter position ) while distracting from the actual goal - ending the conflict . as for the one state solution - in my view neither side is interested in sharing governance with the other , so while it sounds nice it is n't really practical . it 's akin to suggesting that the solution to ww2 is to grant all germans with uk citizenship . most israelis i spoke to view the one-state-solution to be a recipe for national suicide - granting citizenship to millions of muslim arabs would lead to the destruction of the jewish character of the state through sheer demographics and democracy . by ' jewish character ' i 'm referring to hebrew as a formal language , jewish holidays as public holidays , saturday as weekly holiday etc . most states exhibiting christian character ( e.g. celebrating christmas/easter , sunday as weekly holiday etc ) would likewise resist attempts to alter that ."
9wsw7l,"automatic voter registration is not a good idea ( specifically in florida ) i want to preface this that i like the idea behind automatic voter registration . it helps encourage the political process . but specifically , in my home state of florida , under the current system this would not be a good idea , for one main reason . # in florida , the voter roll is public information . anyone can request a disk containing the entire voter roll ( including names , addresses , birthdays , mailing addresses , gender , race , etc. ) for free . there are several sites that offer searchable databases of this data . even if you could get your data off these sites ( some sites refuse to take stuff down ) , you also would have to file an exemption request to get it off government records . the only options available to a common citizen are : victim of sexual battery , aggravated child abuse , aggravated stalking , harassment , aggravated battery , or domestic violence . ( official verification of the crime is required ) certified participant in address confidentiality program ( only for victims of domestic violence ) you can not simply request an exemption just because you want to be anonymous , or because you are afraid of a person who has n't committed a specific provable crime against you . with automatic voter registration , we 'd be putting a large amount of personal information in a public database , most likely without the knowledge of those being registered . this is a massive breach of privacy and can be a danger to society . as this is automatic , this database will begin to look more and more like a database of the names and addresses of the majority of floridians . a white supremacist could use the database to target ethnic minorities , as race is included in the database a person could use the information in the database to possibly commit identity theft a person could be stalked using the information in the database a victim of a crime , such as rape , that they did not report or that could not be prosecuted , could be found by their abuser a person of general popularity , such as an internet celebrity , could be doxxed quite simply , florida needs the way it handles its citizens ' personal data before implementing automatic voter registration . & #x200b ; # tl ; dr : my argument is that we should remove florida 's voter roll from the public sphere before implementing automatic voter registration . i am not against automatic voter registration .","imho , it is intellectually dishonest to frame a privacy concern as an "" automatic "" voter registration problem . like a number of the comments here , i 'm going to point out that what is happening in your very valid critique is you noticing an intersection of completely separate policies that should n't intersect . it 's not that voter roles are public info that 's the problem , nor is it that automatic voter registration is wrong . the issue , like you said , is that one changes the other without the explicit consent of each individual . when a person goes to get their license or anything else at the sos office , then the worker at the desk must be required to ask for consent to put you on the voter rolls . see the issue on the news with supposedly fraudulent ballots or people voting twice or in place of other people ? none of that , True or not , would be remotely possible with automatic registration and could no longer be used as a bs excuse . each voter is automatically registered to one address and no voters have to be on the rolls until election day , so their info is n't just sitting in a file unless they want it to . it 's not like the state just gets the names of every single person over 18 and puts their info on a disc . if you never do any of those things , you 're not on the voter rolls . \ > with automatic voter registration , we 'd be putting a large amount of personal information in a public database , most likely without the knowledge of those being registered . in automatic registration systems there is still an element of consent involved . nobody is being registered to vote without consenting to it ( i.e. everyone who is registered should have full knowledge of their registration ) . it 's not really automatic , is the thing -- it 's triggered by you visiting some kind of state service office ( there are a list of these , the dmv is a big one but also a lot of social services ) and then , instead of you having to opt into registration , they mention it and you have to opt out . the correct statement is florida needs to fix the way it handles personal data . automatic voter registration is a different discussion and the data handling you describe now could be argued to be suppressing voting . in a sense , automatic voter registration could cause a change in data handling culture . if it 's going to cause problems , and it does cause problems , and there are a few high profile cases which are publicly known about , the law may be forced to change because of the shock of what happened . it seems like your opinion should n't be against automatic registration , but about the amount of cubically available voter roll data . so , here 's a fun fact : most states the voter roll is public information . as a candidate for an office , this is vital information ; who is actually registered to vote , and in states with party affiliation , who is likely to vote for me . automatic registration could actually make the necessity of public voter rolls a thing of the past because one can assume that any domicile in the district has at least one if not more registered voters as everyone over the age of 18 is automatically a registered voter . there may still be voter affiliation rolls , but that 's a different beast and some states ( like minnesota ) do n't do voter party registrations . also , keep in mind your name and address information is n't private data , it is public record . if you own property in any state , you can find that information out through public records , tax rolls , etc . point being in this part is that there are numerous public records in which your name and address is publicly visible ."
9wsnja,"you should be able to do whatever you want with your body this includes prostitution , drugs , abortions , etc . i think that we have our bodies and we should be able to do anything we want with them , even if that means trashing them . i think that is just basic freedom . i do n't think that anyone should be in jail or facing charges about previously mentioned things . as long as you do n't do any harm to anyone else , of course . profiting of these things ( if not taxed ) is a different story and should be punished accordingly . in conclusion , i think that you should be able to do anything what you want with yourself , as long it does not have an impact on other people around you . we have evolved enough to manage our lives without anyone telling us what we are not allowed to do . we can make our own decisions , what 's best for us in a situation we might be in . i am open to discussion , will reply to anyone about this . maybe not immediately , because of other things to do .","alternatively , you ’d need to have solid reasons to suggest that the self harm you mention does n’t impact other people , which is quite a difficult position to sustain . and without intervention , such as through proper education on drug use , the cycle of poverty and addiction continues . drugs were just one example you provided , but i thought it was major enough to warrant a distinct argument . some things are regulated because of their potential for harm , not just when they are actually used to harm people . or does the potential for your toddler finding them in your medicine cabinet represent enough of a danger to regulate them regardless of your plans to use them only for you ? 1 . ) religious/spiritual pov : simply , this life was given to you ( from nature , god , your ancestors , whatever your want ) as well as your body and therefore it is immoral to intentionally damage it . collective pov : us humans are in this journey of life together and we morally owe our fellow beings to be healthy , alive , etc. therefore if we hurt ourselves it will inevitably affect other people and thus is immoral . therefore i would argue that you can not do anything to your body if that action has a high risk of risking others . as you abort that bundle of potential life , you prevented all that from happening . so yes , not only did you prevent that bundle of life from being born for your personal benefit , you prevented generations upon generations of people from living . from my perspective , a person may do whatever he/she likes with their body , provided they are not violating the property rights of others ( body ownership is a particular , and particularly important , example of property rights ) . that does n't mean that these activities must have no impact on others though . for instance , if i have a beer , i might be especially cheerful and say hello to a stranger i would otherwise have walked past . so on this view , the abortion question remains contentious : aborting a zygote is acceptable . drugs and prostitution : in themselves , these ' vices ' do n't inherently violate anyones rights . the expectation is that we all will contribute back , and thus society frowns upon behavior that will reduce our ability to do so . question : if research polls showed that users of drug a showed an increase in violence compared to people who did not use it , would you allow laws limiting the use of drug a since it appeared that use of drug a regularly had a negative effect on others ? or can society preemptively decide that something is bad and work to reduce it 's negative effects before they happen ? my stance would be that currently many laws relating to the things you mentioned are far too strict and are detrimental to society ( war on drugs is bad ) . if i get into an accident , that causes more injury to myself , that is someone else 's fault , i have taken away property from them due to my decision to not wear a seat belt . even if it 's my fault as the motorcyclist , if you think of the impact of the other party in the accident you quickly see how much your decision to wear safety equipment has some level of impact on them . when there is a high amount of societal shared cost , your liberties are n't so personal , they impact your neighbors and are therefore logically incompatible . my official argument is that most of the actions of "" self-only-harm "" you mentioned can impact others , and my secondary argument is that if you live in almost any modern nation there is too much cost sharing for you to truly be able to not impact your neighbors with your own actions . perhaps most importantly , you 're supporting the drug industry itself , which means it 's more likely minors can get their hands on harmful substances , and i assume we agree that we have to place a reasonable age barrier for where our libertarian policies begin . and for drugs , i can give a lot of ways they can impact people around the user . what if the drug user has debts and reduces the ability to pay back those obligations , or owns a car and reduces their ability to operate it safely ? abortion for instance there is no question that there is an impact on the unborn , but would you define that as an other person ? for many people they do thus why they see the issue with abortion ."
9wsjtw,""" social justice "" ca n't be taken seriously . i know that all groups have their imbeciles and extremists , but the ones for the so called social justice outnoise their moderate counterparts and that 's all the average citizen is aware of , making some of them even support literal fascists . it 's the left 's fault that the far-right is growing . - i just heard my father complaining about a tv network in my country putting gay kisses all the time in its novelas . a few gay kisses once in a while are good to increase diversity and representation , but spamming them ad nauseam makes some people uncomfortable and they 'll complain . - they completely disregard poor uneducated people , who make up most of the voters in almost every democracy . for most people , caring about historically-repressed groups is n't a priority . why do you think the stereotypical social justice activist is a middle-class college student ? the social justice people often call racism/sexism/homophobia in some offensive things , even if the offense is not obvious . if you see something as offensive , you need to tell why . combined with these poor people 's immediate problems , this is why the likes of trump , bolsonaro and andrzej duda won in their respective countries . - i 've seen someone complaining that the human characters in super smash bros ( with many fantastic creatures as playable characters ) are n't diverse enough . i would say overwatch , but the body shapes of the female characters are kinda monotonous . ssb is from japan , a country that is more homogenous than water with sugar . they wo n't change their pc list just to please some westerner who would n't play the game anyway . star wars has the same problem , but it 's from the us , so complaining about diversity among the human characters is more justified . - i wo n't talk a lot about cultural appropriation , but the line between it and cultural exchange is getting thinner . - i wo n't talk about affirmative action because the circumstances in my country are different .","i 'd say that the way conservatives talk about minorities and poor people is much more radicalizing to the left than someone on tumblr complaining about steven universe characters is to the right . bolsonaro would probably have lost if lula was allowed to run ( and the judge who blocked him was given a seat in bolsonaro 's cabinet ) . finally , an arbitrary person complaining about an arbitrary game does n't strike me as near sufficient to justify your overall claim . your arguments seem to be complaining about other people 's businesses despite them not affecting your life , liberty and prosperity in any major way . at its core , social justice is just respect for fellow persons , and human decency . people regardless of race , religion , sexuality , color , and gender just want to be treated with the kindness , respect , and opportunities , that you would give someone who is a straight white male . representation may not seem like a big deal if you are a part of the majority and see parts of yourself consistently and accurately portrayed in the media , but when who you are is either only portrayed as a joke or stereotype , or not present at all , seeing people like you in the media can have a huge impact . i would like you to perform a little thought experiment , in any sentence where you would have a complaint about a “ social justice warrior ” , and i know you did n’t use this term specifically but it will make this easier , replace that term with one of the following ; it sounds ridiculous now for someone to say “ it ’s ok for them to have a few black couples on tv , but spamming them will make people complain . ”"
9ws8cv,"people who complain about the "" senate popular vote "" are ignorant of how politics works i have seen an unfortunate number of posts on social media about the senate popular vote , which to me , is honestly pretty meaningless . democrats complain that they lost two seats despite having more senate votes . now , i think it is fairly obvious that the reason for this is that the democrats had substantially more senators running for reelection . my link below explains this more , although i do not agree with the part that says republicans should be upset . this leaves me with two explanations of why people think this : 1 ) they are so blinded by party politics that they want to find any reason to further their parties interests 2 ) they are just ignorant to how the senate elections work . i want to give them the benefit of the doubt , so i think 2 is the more likely option . [ -- url -- )","the other side of the argument , however , comes from the sense that as technology has advanced , the united states has gotten smaller , and "" local "" issues are really all that local anymore . people that point to the popular vote in the senate are also those who would favor it shifting even more into the hands of the people themselves as opposed to the states . to argue/complain about it being unconstitutional or something similar does n't really hold up very well , but to argue that the senate should represent the people and therefore a popular vote is relevant is a much sturdier argument . there 's no real answer as to whether senators should answer to the people or the states , but to make an argument based in a popular vote vs seats held discrepancy is certainly something that is a valid argument to make . the reason for my objections as to many political outcomes is that i believe that our political system at a fundimental level is not sufficiently justified to be granted my approval of legitimacy , and , by extension , i would assert that most people should not give it their approval of legitimacy . to an extent , i want to further my political interests by any means necessary , within the political system , that seems to reflect majority desires . the reason that i give a bit of leeway to how this would be achieved in the system is the fact that because the system is so incapable of reflecting majority demands that it is therefore justifiable in disrespecting it to achieve what seems to be majority demands , but we can not be certain of , because we do not have the working infrastructure necessary to allow people to properly enforce what i believe ought to be the legal rights of the people that are currently being denied to them . therefore it is valid for me to assert that no legislation that is enacted under our current system is truly legitimate . even votes for things that the majority of the country seems to agree with are not truly legitimate because the infrastructure necessary to freely and enthusiastically affirm that legislation does not exist . it is because of this that i can say that i have demonstrated both that i understand how politics works and that you do not , because you have based your understanding of how politics on a False notion of popular consent , and the False notion that politics exists exclusively within the realms of the enforced political establishment . popular consent is a demonstrably False notion in politics , given especially the lack of any possible reasonable avenue to respect and expression of popular dis-consent against the system . in reality , politics works only because of a sufficient degree of consent and complacency . the consent can be at a small minority level and complacency can be at a large majority level , and politics can still function , because that still gives the amount of obedience necessary to enable the government to control society , even if most people do . in reality , it is perfectly valid to both deem the government fundamentally illegitimate and still use it as a tool to enact your agenda , and it is in fact vital to be even more involved in the government than the average person if you think that it is illegitimate , because the tool of the government is something that is very necessary to have control over if you want it to cause it to disestablish itself and establish new government in its place . so yes , i understand how politics works , i just happen to have a fundimentally more radical politics than you seem to . and part of radical politics is to vehemently assert the illegitimacy of that system . and if you were to say that "" radical politics is not how politics works "" is to disregard every single politically revolutionary event in history . although the message got muddled as it spread , there was a perfectly valid idea behind the "" senate popular vote "" argument -- it was to rebut the media narrative that because the gop gained seats in the senate , the election results reflected some mixed or pro-trump "" will of the people . "" the reality is that a wide majority of people who voted in these midterms expressed a preference for democrats to represent them . that was the aggregate signal sent by the electorate in 2018 , regardless of how the rules translate that signal into seats . both the senate popular vote and the republican gains in the senate are a product of the rules of the system and the circumstances of which specific seats happened to be up for re-election this year . they have been indoctrinated in the goodness of democracy with little attention being paid to the point of a republic . they are fully aware that the senate is an undemocratic institution in some ways but angry because they went and voted but it feels like their vote did not count . while the senate comes from the original agreement that founded the country it was a different world at a time when binding even the smallest states to them was critical . every state has 2 senators regardless of population which very clearly skews the weight of a vote . i am not saying it is right or wrong but it does feel intuitively wrong . remember this is a continuation of the complaints about the presidential election , with trump losing the popular vote . one way to draw attention to the silly nature of a senate is to point out how disconnected senate elections are from absolute vote numbers . if you were to read a tweet from someone who is just plainly citing a number of how many people die from gun violence yearly in the us vs. the eu , and maybe an aside line about how broken that is , what would your first assumption be ? that this person is anti-gun , and in any more verbose forum than twitter , they would be the first to argue that gun ownership should be restricted . that this person is so bleeding ignorant about guns , that they ca n't even wrap their head around why guns could be dangerous to people , and that they are citing the numbers of gun victims out of sheer bewilderment , as opposed to arguing for restricting guns ."

would probably think my views are racist , sexist , and bigoted if you heard all of them . i ’m telling you this because i think honesty is important , and it helps frame my position more accurately . now , before a mod comes out swinging ready to delete and ban me , i want to preface my main point by saying i want to get away from this way of life . i ’m taking a break from politics for my own mental health and to be a better father and husband , so i have a real stake in forgoing this opinion and am not “ troling for le epic lulz ” . basically i have been convinced ( by far right websites and speakers ) that jews are the root of 99 % of the worlds problems . everything from the declining moral integrity of the west , to economic strife , to the issues facing the black community . i do n’t need a lecture on why this is racist , i just want someone to prove to me that this whole view is a result of cherry picked stats and examples . here are some common talking points used by far right lees that have lead me to this way of thinking : -25 % of harvard grads are jewish - the “ jews have been kicked out of countries 109 times ” fact - the high amount of jewish people oin positions of power compared to population size - jewish pretense is media and journalism that has a liberal bias - jewish influence in us politics and how much america bends over backwards for israel by paying aid and with millitary support . - the obsession with the holocaust and it ’s constant use as the standard for “ worst possible event ever ” despite over genocides being much worse . basically i ’m just tired . i ’m tired of the conspiracy theories , tired of being disgusted whenever i see a jewish last name , tired of being unable to enjoy a movie or a tv show because all i see is propaganda . so to the mods who want to delete this because it ’s “ not in good faith ” please believe me when i say this is just someone looking for help and answers . sincerely , a guy who just wants to be normal again","there is also evidence that jewish people have a higher than average iq , which could explain and over representation in positions of power . how does it sound that jewish people are responsible for 99 % of problems . if we ca n't figure out the motive that jewish people have to cause harm , then it 's pretty unlikely that they are trying to cause harm . to have a debate in more detail than that , maybe you could pick a couple problems that jews might be responsible for and we could talk about why or why not they are responsible . the jews that vote democrat are mostly reforms ( which do n't do any of the jewish rituals , and do n't have connection to israel . just like asian americans , they have the minority mindset , which somewhat forces them to succeed , jews also invest in their children 's education more . for 2000 years , the smartest man in the jewish community ( the rabbi or his son ) got married to the richest woman in the community , so their childern will have the biggest iq in the community and the biggest chances of survival . now repeat this process for 2000 years and do it all across the world and that 's how the jews got a huge iq . let me assure you something , the jews that vote left will lose their indentity in the next 20 years , the military support to israel is less than 0.1 % of the american gdp and it 's also less than 5 % of the israeli one , america became an israeli ally only in 1973 , before that israel was more non alligned and it 's biggest ally was france . i think there are a lot of solid posts in this thread already , but i wanted to give you a little more perspective from someone who was born jewish but has had a pretty different life experience than what has been outlined in the thread . first of all , there are more jews in america than many people realize , especially those from small towns many who have either never met or had very limited interaction with a jewish person . this is in large part due to pre-ww2 european laws that prohibited jews from owning land , so to make a living they had to live in or near cities where other non-agricultural economic opportunities were available . there are about 7.5 million jews in the us or to put it another way , 1/50 us citizens are ethnic jews . there are also plenty of non-practicing jews , atheist jews , "" cultural "" jews ( meaning they celebrate the holidays and keep up some of the traditions , but are n't religious per-se ) , etc . the reason i brought for population size is there simply are n't enough , exclusive or elite positions for jews to occupy . even if all these positions where taken up by jews ( they are n't , and i 'm sure other people will address those points ) , the vast vast vast majority of jews have no extra power or wealth than any other typical middle class person has . i do n't doubt that somewhere someone has gotten their position in part because they were jewish . recent demographic surveys conducted by "" the harvard crimson "" have shown that the total percentage of jewish students is as follows : it should concern you that the number one example you use to support your position that "" jews are the root of 99 % of the worlds problems "" can be debunked by a five second google search . it is highly unlikely that we here will be able to change your mind completely given the nature of this forum , but what we can hopefully do is get you to question your assumptions and direct you to alternate sources that are not vested in furthering the "" jews are uniquely evil "" viewpoint that you have absorbed . read about how claims about the jewish people like "" blood libel "" and the "" protocols of the elders of zion "" were invented out of thin air to justify the persecution and elimination of jewish people around the world , and how these fabrications have persisted to the current day despite being debunked time and time again . if anything jews seem to help the western society by contributing at more skilled positions . 25 % of harvard grads are jewish is not only a ridiculously small sample pool , which would actually need an additional claim of “ harvard grads control the world/subvert the west ” or whatever to actually mean anything , and this implies that 75 % of harvard grads are not jewish . 75 % is larger that 25 % , so this is a weak argument for the “ jews secretly control the world ” narrative . someone else said this before but “ jews being kicked out of 109 ” countries plays against the “ they control everything narrative ” and into the “ they are a marginalized people ” narrative . i mean , most native american peoples have been displaced from their ancestral areas ... are native americans secretly in control of the world too ( of so i would set much like to know where to sign up . ) i ’m not saying it ’s True , it ’s just “ position of power ” is vague and i ca n’t argue with how many jewish congress people there without looking up a statistic . i can say that the us has never had a jewish president , so that sorta makes claims that “ jews control the world and actively subvert the west ” fall flat when this so-called ancient cabal of conspirators either can not control either major political party in the us despite having so many positions of power or can not control enough of the populace to actually gain that power where it really matters . either they control the world an actively relying on non-jewish puppet actors to get things done ... somehow ... or they do n’t actually control anything . even if we assume the argument that jewish media has a liberal bias as True ... that would n’t exactly be a shock . conservatives find supporters on people like neo-nazis and , well , the alt-right who push anti-semitic conspiracy theories . this argument can be used literally for any non-white/non-christian/lgbt group because those groups ’ liberal bias come partially from the aggression of conservative identifying people as groups . aside : i just realized that conservatives do use this argument against non-white/non-christian/lgbt groups . like , i get that trump would rather be friends with out enemies at the cost of our allies , but i ’ve seen the accusations that the us helps the french and so the west is secretly controlled exclusively by the french . like , the connections between trump and russia are way more concrete than any jewish conspiracy and yet the people peddling the jewish conspiracy do n’t make the accusations that russia is controlling the us . i really fail to see how a group of people pointing towards the atrocities inflicted against their own as anything but typical and your argument seems to be saying that because it was n’t literally “ the worst genocide ” ( which c ’ mon , it ’s not a competition ) you ’re saying we should n’t care about it ? i ’m really not sure how “ jewish people say holocaust was really bad ” contributes to the “ control the world and subvert the west ” narrative . if native american people point toward the trail of tears or the reservation systems or any of the attempts at genocide committed against them does that mean they control the world ? \ - the “ jews have been kicked out of countries 109 times ” fact what i have always learned in french history books is that people of jewish origins had a tendency for intellectual professions because of two factors : \ - their culture was very intellectual and children were encouraged as a very young age to write , to read and especially to think critically - and frequent discussion of the torah and of religious text developed abstract thought . \ - because they were the scapegoats of europe and that most "" normal "" professions were forbidden to them , so their only choice was to go for intellectual jobs - they were the only jobs that were accessible to them . as times grew more modern , of course those intellectual professions and intellectual education took more and more importance , and they got interesting jobs and well paid ones - which , alas , fueled even more other people jealousy . \ - the “ jews have been kicked out of countries 109 times ” because jewish people were kicked out of countries and had to find jobs which were not forbidden to them , and because those jobs were generally intellectual , the culture in most jewish families is to give a lot of importance to education ... thus , the excellent school results and the number of harvard graduates . imagine , if you will , a non jewish family where there have been three generations of people involved in mathematics - math teachers , math researchers , etc . starting now , try to replace the word "" jewish "" in your head by "" from a super focused family of math teachers "" . when looking at academical results , there are 2 main points that will affect grades ( when talking about a group , and not an individual , where there is a lot of character differences ) . also see that this is a virtuous circle : you are better educated , thus you get more money , thus you get your kids even better education , thus they get even more money . some cultures think of education , thinking and academics about something really important , other cultures thinks that smooth talking and resourcefulness are way more important . that 's why some cultures ( jews and asians mainly ) , seeing academics as something really important and positive will get way better results in school . western world was ( and is still ) mainly christian , so it 's not strange that jews were persecuted and kicked out of different countries . are jews getting into top colleges at a rate that 's disproportionate to jewish grades , test scores , extra-curricuars , etc. relative to the rest of the applicant pool ? throughout much of history , most top-ranking colleges had explicit jew maximums that could n't be exceeded . the college i went to had a system like that in place until the 60s or 70s , where admissions could mark an application with an ic for irish catholic , gj for good jew , or jb for jew boy , meaning new york city jew , as a way of making sure they did n't let in too many of any of those groups . if you look at the history of american college admissions standards , it 's a history of jewish success despite explicit measures against it . jewish people are overrepresented in terms of professional careers , business ownership , and wealth because that 's always been their historical niche . as i understand it , they first came to europe as merchants , and part of their success is that their strong kinship bonds and presence in every major city assisted them in building international trade and finance networks in medieval europe , where movement of people was otherwise quite rare . in part because of their conspicuous financial success and in part because they belonged to a different religion in an era when that was a really big deal , there have always been harsh anti-semitic laws , outbreaks of anti-jewish violence , and a tendency of host countries to expel them and keep their belongings . this has led the jewish people as a culture to historically value wealth in easily transportable/tradeable forms ( diamonds , gold , fine art ) , hence the large jewish presence in diamond-trading and the fine art world , as opposed to say , real estate/agriculture/mining , where land can be easily seized without compensation by the local king if he has a pressing need to fund a war or find someone to blame for losing one . globalization has meant that carving out a niche in international trade and finance during the middle ages has paid enormous dividends , leading to a fairly substantial number of jewish people becoming very , very wealthy , which has in turn led to many of them purchasing the kinds of thing wealthy people like to buy : casinos , newspapers , hollywood studios , etc . unfortunately , close cultural ties , a worldwide presence due to historical trading networks , physical separation resulting from laws about where jews are allowed to live , jewish laws about who jews are allowed to marry and still remain jewish , mutual xenophobia arising from years of persecution , and involvement in international trade , finance , and the media is pretty much the perfect recipe if you 're looking for a group of people to blame for your problems , which is typically when the jews run into trouble - everything 's cool until there 's a recession or crisis , and then ignoramuses ( and unscrupulous politicians ) start looking for scapegoats . the other outcome is that jewish people feel permanently unsafe in the countries in which they live , and it 's hard to blame them - anti-jewish violence is the norm all over the world , and it 's rare that they 've ever been made welcome - hard-ceilinged quotas are a common jewish experience in both immigration and education . i wo n't lie , it can create weird tensions , but no different than it would if , say , a person was a dual french-american citizen and advocated policies to the american government that were beneficial to france and questionable for america . there 's a lot of good comments here already ; however , the thing that will change your view is already in your post and you do n't even realize it : the whole spiel about jewish plots is indeed a conspiracy theory , and recognizing that is by far the biggest step to changing your mind . now let 's look at something you blame the jews for : economic strife . some people are homeless because they 're gay and their parents kicked them out , and the history of that goes back to homophobia that was common among everyone for a long time , and the white religious right in the u.s . other people are homeless because they have a gambling addiction , and lost everything , and the history of gambling as a social institution goes back a long time . now , maybe you 're tempted at this point to say that every cause of homelessness goes back to money , and jews control money . jews did n't invent money , and they did n't invent the current form that money takes in modern society . the real answer involves a lot of stuff about how egyptian society was set up , and a lot of ancient engineering tricks that most people do n't know about because they 've been replaced by more efficient methods . however , i believe your entire post is an argument for promoting diversity , and is a similar way of thinking that people who are for affirmative action have ( although much more radical and dangerous imo ) . i know you did n’t “ ask for a lecture , ” but people like you are the real problem — not the jews or the gays or the women who do n’t want to have sex with you because of your repulsive hatefulness . because the truth is complicated , a right-wing pundit can make a short , snappy statement ( however wrong it may be ) and people remember it and repeat it . the longer , nuanced answer is n't remembered as well , and the person delivering it typically "" looks weaker "" at an extremely basic and animal level . not because they are valid . but because they do n't talk to the part of your brain that invalidates incident premises . i 'll start small - that "" 109 expulsions "" fact is not a fact at all and includes some actual expulsions of jews and a lot of misrepresentations . yo , so ill start by saying that i am an israely jew . the reason i think you have a high representation of jews in many high influencing positions is a sort of survival 's bias . on the other hand , the iq distribution of european jews is around 115 iq . there are many theories as to why , personally , i like the one saying that being a small closed religion for centuries , jews put a lot of value on being a scholar . and since the jewish community isnt that welcoming to outsiders ( its pretty hard to convert to judaism ) , over time the average smarts of a single person rose . and now , since we live in a society that values intellectuals , more jews survive the cut to make it into the high influencing positions than their actual percentage in the population . compared to the general public , in percentage , there are more smart jews . and thats why it seems like there is an unfair representation of jews in high power positions . you can google for "" ashkenazi jew iq "" and "" iq and success "" for articles about what i stated before . in israel , there is a huge secular majority , people who dont practice religion at all , basically atheists ... another majority of regular religious people , like your average christians , and a minority of orthodox jews . also , you got several jewish sectors , like your catholic and protestant , jews have the ashkenazi and mizrahi ... and its another internal struggle ... the point of this tid bit is that the grass isnt really greener ... jews suffer from exactly the same crap every other ethnicity suffers . if you replace “ jews ” with “ white christian men ” and a few other amendments , i ’m amazed you do n’t believe that white christian men control everything . so , im going to skip over the pretense assumption , because alt-right changes the presumed pretense based on the time of day . if obsession with something means that your are over estimating how bad it is , maybe the alt-rights obsession with jewish influence should be reconsidered as hypocritical ?"
9womjg,"i do n't think society should ever accept pedophilia as an acceptable alternative lifestyle . as society progresses and marches forward into that bright gray rainbow of equality , pedophilia may or may not be promoted as an acceptable lifestyle choice , and not considered morally reprehensible , but rather not","a child whose brain has not yet fully developed in no way can give consent to such an act . pedophilia is listed in the dsm-v and recognized as a disorder , we recognize that these people have something inherently wrong in their brains that results in the urges and attractions they feel . we also recognize , however , that it 's not necessarily something they have control over -- much like you ca n't "" choose "" to be gay or straight , you just are . however , pedophiles can choose if they act upon those urges . and while we recognize that it 's a heinous act , you could argue that instead of immediately villainizing anyone who admits to such urges , we should extend a helpful hand offering treatment and assistance to those who do n't act upon their urges and want to fight it . perhaps by ' normalizing ' it in the extent that we recognize that it 's a condition that requires constant treatment and vigilance to overcome , and that it 's no fault of the individual suffering from it , we could help lessen the number of children who are sexually assaulted by pedophiles . if people suffering from pedophilia can see an avenue out in the form of judgement free treatment they would potentially be less likely to suffer quietly and eventually succumb . so while the act itself would n't be normalized , perhaps the condition itself of pedophilia could be as a means to provide treatment and therapy and lessen the number of people who act upon it . i 've never talked to a paedophile so i ca n't argue whether they actually have control over these urges , but if they do n't , would n't it be better to help them and reduce the suffering for everyone ? so long as paedophilic thoughts are not acted upon in a harmful manner , i do n't see a problem with having the thoughts themselves . people are talking about treating pedophiles as people with a problem that society should help them control rather than perverts with criminal tendencies , but i 've never heard anyone promoting the legitimization of the practice of pedophilia . i promise , being okay with consenting adults being in same-gender relationships or changing their own bodies to be who they are is n't going to lead to a society where its okay to rape children . in america people would call that pedophilia but it 's perfectly legal other places . imagine a future advanced society with no pregnancy , no std , and no traditional family structure , where sex is just not seen as big deal for anyone to engage in and is not seen as anything special . kids in that society are all also very smart , highly knowledgable and taught about sex from young age and are thus not at risk of psychological harm . i do n't think it would be a huge deal for post-puberty kids to have sex in such a society . the current stigmatization of pedophiles leads to many people being socially isolated and suffering from anxiety , depression and other mental health problems . at the same time they have no help available to them because pedophilia is deemed "" unacceptable "" even among many mental health professionals . instead of judging people based on their thoughts we should judge them based on their actions . the lgbt + community will never accept pedophiles because pedophilia objectively hurts people at the most vulnerable time in their lives . back then , many people got married at such a young age because there was n’t exactly any other time to best do it then"
9woeqi,"being outraged about people wearing fur whilst eating meat most days of the week is hypocritical . in the same way that you could argue that wearing fur is unnecessary now because of the wealth of alternatives that are available , it could be argued that eating meat is also unnecessary because there are so many alternatives out there and we do n't need to eat meat to comfortably survive . from an ethical point of view , we kill animals for their meat which we then buy to consume ( mostly ) in one meal . a burger can be eaten once , but a fur coat can be worn over and over again . how can the outrage against fur be justified when as a society , we ( for the most part ) kill animals so we can have the instant gratification of eating something that we think tastes nice ? would killing an animal for a coat not have more purpose than killing an animal so the end-consumer can have a few pieces of chicken in their curry ? furthermore , how do we morally justify killing an animal for one purpose and not another ? if you 're not ok with animal fur being used in clothing , why are you ok with eating meat with your meals or using animals to make gummy bears ? & #x200b ; disclaimer : i 'm a vegetarian edging towards veganism . i 'm not trying to come across as patronising and/or preachy - i 'm just genuinely curious and am looking for some arguments that can challenge my views .","if we stopped eating meat , millions of cows would never be born . because animals hunted for fur are often exotic or near extinction . the animals most commonly consumed for meat , are all well utilized to produce as many goods with them as possible . if i kill a fox to make gloves , it just goes to waste , and the fox population dwindles , this can have much larger ramifications if everyone starts hunting fox to make gloves . at the end of the day the key distinction is over animal husbandry . most furs do n't come from animals that are domesticated for that purpose . so let ’s hypothetically say we have 3 animals that are killed . one is killed for meat and feeds a family for several weeks . the third is killed and used for meat , its bones are used for other things - say ground up to fertilize crop , and its skin is used as fur or hide . do you see all of these as equal , simply because they all start with killing an animal , or are there meaningful differences depending on what the intended use is ? i do n't like when fur is made from endangered or threatened animals . i do n't care as much about eating meat and i do n't care as much about fur clothing being worn from common animals ( leather is kind of like this ) . hypocrisy is if you claim to be a vegetarian and secretly eat meat . but we can keep the social rule against fur if it 's still enforced . so one may reasonably continue to enforce that rule while working on the vegetarianism thing personally . eventually that will be a social rule as well , but it is n't yet . if a person moral code says "" wearing fur is bad "" and "" eating meat is ok "" , there is hypocrisy only if they wear fur . i take it a step further and say those outraged over abortions because of “ life ” are really hypocritical because animals have far more personality , feelings , and self than the fetus they want to protect . more specifically , outrage over fur implies the existence of a social norm against killing and using animals for certain purposes , and is a starting point from which someone may be convinced to endorse a broader norm and adopt a vegetarian or vegan diet . a similar case can be made for the outrage over trophy hunting - it 's not clear to me that standing proudly over a dead lion is more morally problematic than showing off a new leather jacket , but the outrage over the former is the thin end of a wedge that might be used to make a case against the latter . not sure if even agreeing with all this really would be a ' change of view ' but i think it is worth considering before weighing the negatives of hypocrisy on the issue ."
9wk92c,"the shooting of jemel roberson , a black security guard shot by the police outside of a bar , is in no way the fault of the police officers involved . for people who have not heard of this : jemel robinson , security guard at a southern bar , responded to an active shooter situation ( after an earlier confrontation with security , men came into the bar with guns at 4 in the morning ) . after managing to subdue one of the men with his own gun , robinson awaited police backup by holding the suspect down with a knee on his back and a gun to the back of his head . when two officers arrived , bearing no knowledge of the situation except for the fact that there was some altercation and men were armed . immediately they were greeted with robinson . pressing his gun into the back of a man ’s head . one of the officers responded by shooting robinson to death . a tragic encounter , but in no way the fault of the police officers involved . in life or death situations , it is not the polices job to ask questions or take risks . the first priority is to defuse the situation . prepared to encounter armed assailants , they arrived at the scene and saw what they believed to be an armed assailant with a gun to the head of a civilian . there is no time in these situations to ask questions or wonder if there is a better explanation . in their head , they were saving an innocent life , and any further delay in action could have been there difference between life or death . i do not like how people assume every black person shot by a police officer was shot because they were black . there are many instances in which this does occur , although this specific instance was not one of them . it was tragic , it was unfortunate , but the officer reacted in accordance with his training , with the intention of saving lives and defusing the situation . this is my understanding of the situation . i hope my view can be changed . source : -- url -- this is what i ’m arguing against .","that is , what would have to be different about this event for you to consider the officers who shot roberson responsible for their mistake ? as things stand , it is a person 's legal right to own a gun and to use it to defend themselves or others around them . you should n't be afraid of getting killed by police if you legally use your gun to defend yourself . police are the people who we pay and train to uphold these laws , so they 're the ones who are responsible for ensuring that laws are enforced , and enforced correctly . the problem of what to do when you respond to a shooting , and a legal gun user uses a gun in defense is a difficult problem , but as law enforcement , it 's their problem to solve . it 's his "" fault "" in the sense that he obviously sucks at his job . the job entails making really tough judgment calls , and he failed to make the right call . it 's not an easy task , but failing at it does n't mean you should still be considered a successful police officer . another thing you ca n't do while black -- be a hero . you 're aware this just gives police officers carte blanche to kill whoever they want if they 're called to a scene right ? but here 's why the "" shoot first , ask questions later "" approach is totally wrong imo : they shot him because they assumed he was the perp and did n't want to risk him taking an innocent life , right ? in my opinion , innocent blood should never be directly on the hands of those who are meant to serve and protect us ( at least in theory , anyway ) . they absolutely should take the time to properly assess the situation so they can respond justly . if lives are unfortunately lost as a result , then at least the blood is on the hands of the criminal . but defusing , as opposed to escalation , means not killing people . personally i say the cop is to be held acountable . we call the cops because we expect them to be the voice of reason and defuse a situation . ill wait for more evidence to make my full opinion but if it comes to light that the cops went in directly and shot rather than tell him to put the gun down . than the cop should be tried for manslaughter and this case should be used as precedent so that other like minded cops could get their act together and uphold the law and maintain the peace the way they are being paid to just because someone believes someone poses a threat , that does n’t necessarily justify using force , especially deadly force , against them . there had to be some reasonable basis to support their belief there exists a threat . in other words , were there sufficient indicators that would cause a reasonable person to believe ( even mistakenly ) someone poses a threat and that force is the only option necessary to protect oneself . according to the use of force policy of the chicago pd , they are required to seek de-escalation before using force ( pg . and they must identify themselves as police officers before using lethal force ( pg . . it appears they violated their own guidelines in shooting jemel robinson . if it had been a white man holding an assailant down and the bystanders yelling "" security ! "" the point is n't just whether a shooting is justified or not , it 's whether certain people get shot when it 's not justified more often -- perhaps because they 're viewed as more threatening . or because people think of typical 2a members as white , and not black . but this man was not given the same benefit of the doubt -- he was n't judged innocent until proven guilty . besides , the argument is n't so much that cops are murderers ( though some certainly are ) as they are incompetent . here we have an upstanding security guard who apprehended a criminal with a gun without killing him ... who then gets shot by the police , who are significantly more trigger happy . so the security guard is able to subdue someone who opened fire on a bar and manage to keep him subdued with out killing him . but a trained police officer comes on to the scene , and within 10 seconds kills the guy wearing a security uniform . the people there where also yelling at the cop telling him that the guy was a security guard . ive seen cops take white men who physically assault them and shoot at them alive . the officer did not react in accordance with his training . his training would have him try to deescalate the situation before resorting to lethal force ( like they tend to do with white men who are actually trying to kill them ) . your way of thinking would give police officers the ability to kill anyone and just say "" well i had to make a split decision "" . i think the bottom line is they are responsible for their weapon safety and actions . if they shot the wrong person this breaks their rules of weapon safety and is on them . legally , the justification probably makes it some sort of manslaughter rather than murder , but the officers still killed the security guard . clearly police will often encounter ambiguous situations , but their training and predisposition is to always assume that shooting is the correct response . that 's problematic . this case was basically a hostage situation since it does n't appear that the security guard had pointed the gun at the cops . to the arriving cops , it 's basically a hostage situation . the first outcome is they could take time to assess the situation and risk having a victim get shot by the guy with the gun . or they could immediately shoot the guy with the gun . in the first outcome , there is only a chance of someone getting hurt , and if the hostage was hurt i would blame the shooter , not the cops . in the second outcome , there is a 100 % chance of someone getting hurt and it is all on the cops . i do n't see how you can say it 's not the fault of the officers . you even say they encountered an ambiguous situation and made a choice which happened to be wrong . is that not their job ? how can they serve and protect the public if they do n't take time to evaluate ambiguous situations ."

"" after mass tragedy occurs . i certainly understand this point of view , especially coming from grieving family members . but i think it is natural , normal , and even beneficial for the general public to know as much detail as possible about mass shooters after they 've committed their crimes , for three reasons : 1 ) knowing a mass shooter 's name is not in and of itself honoring a mass shooter , anymore than being educated about history 's greatest villains ( hitler , kahn , mussolini ) is glorifying those men . we learn about those men so we can not repeat the same mistakes they made . even if a mass shooter 's motive is for some sort of public recognition , 2 ) we should pay homage to victims . but knowing a victim 's name does n't help prevent the next mass shooting . knowing information about the shooter - they 're background , how they got access to the gun , any motivation for the killing - can help government , law enforcement officials , and citizens recognize signs in potential would-be mass shooters . 3 ) on a more personal note , i think if i myself were a victim of a mass shooting , i would not want my name and picture plastered all over the news with strangers reacting empathetically to a person they never knew and my family members giving platitudes to a national audience in my honor , only because i died a horrible death . i would rather the public concern themselves with how to stop this from happening again , and my family mourn my passing in private . if my passing spurs my family , after a period of mourning , to become public advocates for the gun control cause , i am fine with that . but that is not what happens in the immediate wake of a mass shooting . 4 ) for those who think publishing the name is dishonoring , why do we draw the line at the name ? there are many people who revel in simply causing chaos and seeing it reported , not necessarily needing their name attached to the reporting for them to feel gratification ( thinking of ted kaczynski , many serial murders , and likely many mass shooters ) . if reporting the name is dishonoring to the victims or spurs more copycats , why not advocate not reporting the events at all , or not reporting the location , time , and methods used ?","for many individuals they want to be remebered , they want to leave an impact the world , they know they will be infamous and hated and they want that . ation as everyone remeber the impact that this person did , theh want that and in doing this it further reinforces the idea that if someone else does it they will be treated the same . this i agree with , i think its important that we work to figure out why and how these events are happening i just feel that who did it , is not important and potentislly harmful . imo it makes it more personal , while its True that many people can simply revel in the fact that the act alone gathered so much attention adding a face and name to it just makes it that more appealing , i feel its important to report on the events but i dont see how adding a name or face to the shooter helps therefore i feel we simplely shouldnt give that info out . hypothetically , do you think that if there was a law that made publishing details about mass murderers illegal , it would reduce the number of mass murders ? it 's well known that mass publicizing suicides often leads to a copycat effect . it 's hard to study this exactly ( you ca n't exactly run a randomized control trial , and the sample size is small ) but it 's well accepted . people are n't objecting to the fact that the police are investigating motives etc so as to prevent another effect in the future , they 're objecting to media coverage of the event . this seems to be less about publicizing the name of the shooter than the victims , so i 'm not sure how it relates to your thesis . imo , only those that have a professional reason to know the what/who/where / when/why/how of these attacks should be given this info ."
9wglfd,"you are not a patriot if you do n't believe in the foundational ideas / core values of your country . i know someone who describes her father as the biggest patriot she 's ever met ( united states ) . i 've met her father several times , and he was an activist who wanted to see the us turn into a socialist country -- by this i mean , actual socialism , not just some "" democratic socialism "" where it 's basically capitalism with some government intervention and lots of government-sponsored programs ( e.g. welfare , single-payer healthcare ) . part of her argument for him being a patriot is that he criticizes the country ( mostly for not being socialist ) . this does n't seem like patriotism to me . socialism is not compatible with the foundational principles of this country . you could argue that he loves the people of the country and wants something better ( in his opinion ) for them . i guess you could argue that he loves the land itself or something . but that 's something other than patriotism in my mind . now , i can see how it would be patriotism to criticize the country for not living up to it 's foundational principles , but i do n't see how it 's patriotism to reject it 's foundational principles . cmv","a large number of countries , whether colonial states , colonies gaining independence , or countries whose founders where influenced by racist ideology , have foundational ideas which are , quite frankly , racist . in my mind , "" patriotism "" is just a person 's love and devotion to their country . like , we can imagine someone who strongly believes in the "" foundational ideas "" of their country , but does n't believe their country has ever realized them , and so only feels deep contempt for their country . remember , also , that most countries do not have "" foundational ideas "" in the way the united states does . patriot : a person who vigorously supports their country and is prepared to defend it against enemies or detractors . so a soldier , for example , is a patriot regardless of their political views . i think the problem with your view is that people can reasonably disagree on what "" core values of your country "" are , but it honestly does n't matter . you just have to support the country and be prepared to defend it . whether or not socialism is part of a foundational value does n't seem relevant since "" enemies "" is subjective . i do agree that someone that criticizes their country is not a patriot , but are you sure they are n't just criticizing current politicians or something like that , who are fully capable of being "" enemies of the country "" ? standing up for the people of your country against those that would seek to corrupt it ( in their viewpoint ) is a form of patriotism . why do you think that "" socialism is not compatible with the foundational principles of this country ? "" before an amendment was passed , someone had to clearly disagree with some portion of the constitution and believe that its core , foundational values had to change . suppose i do get an amendment passed but i you think it was a bad amendment - when that amendment passes do i instantly become the patriot since i agree with the new values , and you lose your status as a patriot for disagreeing with the amendment ? you ’ve defined patriotism in such a way that by definition it means loyalty to the particular way a government is structured . but under that framework of thought i just mentioned , which i think is more logical , a person who want to radically change his country to improve the lives of his countrymen would still be a patriot . in fact , he ’d be more of a patriot than a person who wanted to keep the existing structure of government just because it is foundational . so he believes in something and wants that implemented in his country because he believes it 'll work best but because some people way back when disagreed he can not be a patriot ? you mention socialism not being compatible with this country and issues of foundational tenants . that is to say , there is no reason that socialism could n’t be implemented in this country if done through a democratic procedure . there is nothing explicitly “ american ” about free market capitalism and should n’t be considered a foundational belief . if by patriot you simply mean “ someone who accepts and supports the foundational text of a country ” then i guess your argument works , but patriotism is typically tied to a love for a country ( hence the typical line of “ i love my country , not my president ) . since a democracy is predicated on being ruled by the people for the people , i ’d argue that , when the well being of the people is in direct conflict with the constitution , the well being of the people outweigh the formal paperwork that founded a country ."
9wgjf0,"relaxed immigration law enforcement leads to significantly more suffering than it alleviates . as a preface , i hate the fact that most issues are along party line . whenever i bring up political topics with other people i always get the feeling that they have never thought about the issue and they are just reflexively giving responses or having emotions based on what they 've passively absorbed depending on their political leaning . immigration is a particular pain point for most people . i have the experience of living in a very rural town with illegal immigrants for most of my young adult life as well as living in a relatively wealthy city with a middle-class job for my older adult life so far . so , i can see two wildly different worlds . most of the illegal immigrants i know are very hard workers , they open buisnesses ( through legal foo ) , pay taxes and have children that many times go on to college to benefit society . i have no doubt that immigration is a net positive for society . this is what most middle-class voters understand , but few understand how bad it is for a lot of illegal immigrants . these workers are not treated like other people at all . many are severely overworked with almost no time off and little time to sleep , many do not get paid minimum wage even if they have some supervisory role and many are treated as disposable . even worse some are sent over by coyotes who they owe money to , and they hold it over them like slaves . these things are made doubly worse by the fact that they constantly have to be reminded that they do not belong or constantly tensing up with unease every time they pass a cop on the road . i know that many people will say that it was their choice to come , or that they could leave , but these opinions are not always realistic . wifes who followed their husbands , children who were forced over by their parents , people fleeing hardships and extreme poverty , predatory coyotes seeking money , there are many reasons that people come over that are not entirely their fault . from what i 've seen in my local area , immigration laws are haphazardly enforced . most people are sympathetic to illegal immigrants , including cops . so they almost always help them . after seeing how things are ( in my own town , of course ) , i ca n't help but think that being relaxed about immigration is n't sympathetic . cynically i 'm inclined to believe that some people support very relaxed immigration to keep the cycle of abuse going . a lot of people make a lot of money from illegal immigration and there is a monetary interest in keeping it going . i 'm not anti-immigration , i 'm anti-wishy/washy policies that harm people . if the boarders are not open for people to move across , then stop letting people cross them . worse , stop letting people establish families here while constantly telling them they do n't belong . if they do n't belong , deport them . supporting illegal immigrants , or sanctuary cities or the like is only supporting a cycle of abuse and use of illegal immigrants .","when police cooperate with immigration enforcement , people who are unlawfully present are afraid to go to the police . communication between different enforcement agencies scares people into not reporting abuses . they have no one to turn to who wo n't send them to ice to get kicked out of the country . decoupling immigration enforcement from these other parts of government , disallowing communication between them , raises the costs of those abusing those unlawfully present by increasing reporting of such behavior . i want to make sure i 'm understanding your argument : you believe that folks who immigrate illegally are poorly treated , because they are often exploited . i think you are certainly correct that undocumented immigrants are vulnerable to exploitation , but it seems clear that policing the people/companies doing the exploitation would certainly be a more effective way to address that mistreatment . there may always be people who flee their home country due to war or economic circumstances , and managing each individual is nearly impossible . of course , you can also create places like sanctuary cities ( or even sanctuary states ) , where illegal immigrants are not living in fear of deportation for doing things like reporting coyotes , or sweatshop owners . i 've worked with folks fleeing el salvador . if they had stayed in the country , it is likely their entire families would have been abused and murdered , which obviously is far worse than their current situation , where they 're being mistreated by employers who underpay and overwork them ."
9wg98r,"i do n’t see a problem with public schools in less affluent areas being lower quality than schools in more affluent districts i often hear about how schools in inner city districts are underfunded & offer a lesser quality education than public schools in more affluent areas . a large percentage of any school 's budget come from local property tax in that district , with the remainder being from a general state pool and then the smallest percentage being from federal funding . my understanding is that all schools get a comparable amount of money from the federal & general state pools with the biggest difference coming from how much money comes from their local district through property taxes and whatnot . if the people in that district are paying more in local taxes & have voted on various initiatives to fund their schools more out of their own pockets i do n't see how that 's unfair to people in underfunded schools ? trying to equalize how much money schools get in a state by somehow spreading out that local money seems unfair to me . if a taxpayer pays more to fund their local school they should be able to reap the benefit of that school being better .","if a parent has the money , time and/or desire to give their kids a better education , they can and should . one will answer , “ they can go to that good school if they just move into the neighborhood ! ” but the real problem — the biggest and hardest to see , and therefore to fix , problem — is that zoning restrictions are purposely designed to keep poor families out of affluent neighborhoods . and since you have to live in the neighborhood/district to go to the school , but the area literally disallows cheaper housing in their area , then if you are poor , you can not attend the rich school . our country was founded on the idea that every person is equal to one another . the one thing that stays the same among all people in the united states is that we must all have an education up until the age of 16 . it is our duty as a nation to ensure that each child gets the same standardized education system so that they each are given an equal right to success after high school . more than that , underfunded schools in inner city districts often need more support than those in affluent neighborhoods . affluent parents can afford to give their children things such as tutors and three meals a day . many parents in underfunded school districts can barely afford to send their children a packed lunch or feed them breakfast . these students are already disadvantaged and saying that they should continue to have underfunded schools just continues the cycle of poverty that ensures that people from inner city districts have to try more than twice as hard to get the same opportunities as someone from a wealthy district . it 's widely considered unfair for children to be punished really seriously for their parents ' bad decisions . education is perhaps -- along with healthcare -- the most important public good for children . receiving a low quality education or being educated in an unsafe environment is very bad for kids and can have long-lasting impacts . maybe take a step back and ask yourself -- under your view , why should tax payers be required to fund schools at all ? but a lot of people in lower-cost areas rent their living spaces ( homes , apartments , etc. ) , not own . and the actual owners of the living spaces often do n't live anywhere near the buildings they own . they have a vested interest in lower property taxes because they do n't see a personal benefit from the property taxes they pay . is n't it worth it to all of us to make sure all of us get the best possible education ? here 's the core issue : schools serve children , and children do not get to make funding decisions for themselves . in our current system , if you live in a wealthy neighborhood you get to go to a good school for free . if you do n't get a good education , you will grow up to be poor . in principle , education can break that cycle ; if we provide a high quality education to poor children , they wo n't grow up to be poor . the unfair part is that people in wealthier districts have the option to send more money into schools . people in poor districts are n't choosing to underfund their schools , they have no choice . it 's unfair to the children attending those schools . they play no part whatsoever in how much money their schools receive . no decisions they make affect how much money their schools receive , because they are children . a lot of this may have to do with what "" fair "" or "" unfair "" mean . do you think that people who complain about lower school funding in poor areas have the same meaning of "" fair "" in mind as you do when they complain about it ? people talk about education as a way to promote social mobility ."

9wfisn,"illegal immigration hurts lower class workers , especially those located near the southern border , due to lower wages as a result of the increase of workers and because that companies view them cheaper than american citizens i do n't necessarily subscribe to this view but you generally hear this argument alot . in all honesty i have n't done the research so i will not say that this is a viable fact . but common sense tells me that illegal immigration does have its detriments to american workers . it would be foolish to say that the influx of illegal immigration helps the economy , 100 % a point my classmate made in our ethics class . surely there must be some detriment to illegal immigration , especially for lower class citizens . but like i said , i have n't studied so please correct me !","illegal immigration could hurt lower class workers if it drives down wages in areas where employers are willing to pay higher wages and americans are already filling all available jobs . in other words , it 's bad for lower class american workers if employers are just replacing existing american workers with lower cost illegal immigrants . but a lot of illegal immigrants ( or legal seasonal workers from other countries , who often get lumped into these discussions ) are employed in sectors where employers have trouble filling jobs because what they can feasibly afford to pay is pretty low and the work sucks . would lower class american workers flock to fill empty jobs picking produce in the sun for 12 hours a day for minimum wage ? there 's also the question of whether illegal immigrant workers help the economy overall , regardless of their impact on american workers . lowering labor costs , or allowing employers to hire people at all to do certain jobs , benefits everyone who consumes those products ( including the lower class ) . this is especially noticeable in areas that tend to employee illegal immigrants , like agriculture . now i happen to think pure economic benefit is n't enough reason alone to do or not do something , but it 's reasonable to argue that illegal immigrant labor does have some positive economic impact . there seems to be a consensus that illegal immigration is bad for the lowest class workers ( including black americans without high school diplomas ) , however , as you move of the socioeconomic ladder the impact of illegal immigration becomes ambiguous , before becoming overwhelmingly positive . there is always the argument like those below revolving around economic theory , but there is also the fact that illegal immigrants most often do the sorts of jobs that even lower class americans would refuse to do . jobs that are usually manual labor intensive as well as easy for employers to pay cash ( almost always at a below minimum wage rate ) to circumvent the fact that the employee is an illegal alien . the most notable example is in agriculture , where is it estimated that around half of all fieldworkers are unauthorized to work in the us . these are jobs that the standard urban low class american would never agree to do in the first place , and so illegal immigration , forming the backbone of the us agricultural labor force , actually helps all of us by making sure we stay fed . not to mention that the low wages allow food prices to stay lower than they would be if american workers worked the same jobs . it is True that an influx of illegal immigrants does , in whole , help the economy . this is a pretty accepted ( but cold and calculating ) economic takeaway , it has to do with an increase in labor supply resulting in lower prices and increased output and a lot of other economic stuff . of course that should n’t be confused with the fact that it drives down wages and gives shady companies incentive to undercut american workers . that ’s the fault of the american businesses that break labor laws by knowingly hire illegal immigrants . it is n’t immigration hurting americans like the ones you mention , it ’s the lax enforcement and disregard for the labor laws in place to protect them"
9wf4yk,"control is needed in america many people with guns in america think that there should be guns in america and that it will make the country safer . now , say we are in some other country and everyone has guns and everyone is super safe . fine , i agree . and most people in this country who like guns and have them say “ look at this country it is the safest and everyone has guns ” . i would be fine with this if this worked for this country . but it does not . we , as americans , almost all of us have them , even me although i am against them . mass shooting and school shooting still occur over 10x more in this country then any other . my solution for this problem is to have heavier background checks . this would include things like , suicidal thoughts and actions , depression , thoughts of harm , asking what the gun will be used for , and many more things . i also think that we should be sure that people traveling must not be allowed to bring guns into our country . this would limit the amount of people that get a gun without background checks . change my view","also , if you take a look at the more reasonable gun control proposals and look at what impact they 'd have on our previous mass shootings , you 'd see that most of the proposals would have little to no effect . for example , a mental health requirement might make sense on the surface , until you realize that most of the mass shooters would 've passed what is being proposed and this could also have the negative effect of people who enjoy owning guns avoiding getting professional help for fear of getting banned from gun ownership . making it less likely for gun owners to see professional help could , in theory , result in more mass shootings . i think we should add laws closing the loophole that allows purchasing of guns without a background check , but that has nothing to do with mass shootings , because none of the mass shooters i 'm familiar with would 've failed a background check . the reasonable restrictions that i 've seen proposed do n't really have much power to prevent mass shootings . many of these problems are linked to more fundamental social issues like poverty , mental illness stigma and lack of support , etc . these problems are n't going away , and if the do , it wo n't be because someone passed a single law , though certainly passing laws is part of the solution . it 's not really about making the nation as a whole safe , it 's my right to own a gun to make "" me "" safer . mass shootings could very easily occur in other developed countries , it just seems to be a trend here . guns have been around much longer than this all of a sudden surge in the shootings the last 5 years . how exactly your law will fix the problem and over what timeframe , and explain how your proposal can not be abused to deprive law abiding citizens of their right to self defense or their 2a rights . the people who are shooting up places and doing criminal acts of violence with weapons do not give a rip about your laws and regulations . they do not care about being legal , safe , or controlled . the gun owners who follow the laws are not the ones who need to be worried about . i 'm not saying everyone owning a gun will keep crime down because that 's a moral heart issue . what i am saying is if you own a gun and are in a situation were someone is violent or shooting up a place you can at least take them down reducing casualties . if your solution is simply "" less guns "" you should know that there is no correlation between rates of gun ownership and rates of gun homicides . while i agree that american gun laws are stupid , the problem is that it 's far too late for america to try any of the solutions that work in other countries . other countries implemented their gun control systems before guns were allowed to proliferate , thus stopping the problem before it begins . i have nothing against legit gun enthusiasts who are just normal people who enjoy shooting , but there are also plenty of right-wing nutjobs who stockpile weapons in anticipation of some war or government overreach or whatever . even if they themselves do n't carry out attacks , who 's to stop them from selling guns to the next nikolas cruz ? tldr - america has amassed way too many guns for any gun control solutions to have any hope of being effective . maybe the background check system can be improved , maybe it can be replaced , but what needs to be done first and foremost is prove it 's effectiveness one way or the other . the vast majority of gun violence is in central and south america , to the point that the usa is not even close mass shootings on the steady decrease in usa as well . it 's also important to recognize that the majority of death in america comes from second-hand or stolen weapons . for the record i am pro-common sense gun law , i just worry that "" reactionary "" gun law is what makes headlines and ignores the real victims , either due to racism ( gun deaths from illegal firearms are largely black and brown ) or a more sinister possibility that politicians focus on unwinnable gun-law arguments for the sole purpose of perpetuating the conversations and thus insuring reelection on both sides . if the goal is to eliminate gun deaths , then the conversations must shift to dealing with the guns already in circulation , not the ones being sold ."

"" . now , this was obviously a racist statement to make , regardless of whether or not officer frank drebin was actually thinking of pygmy tribes when he said it . rather , people have been pointing out the problems with using ' man ' as a symbol for all humanity for literally generations . if you encourage people to choose what terms they are called by , then why object to people asking to be called "" first-year "" instead of "" freshman "" , or "" folks "" instead of "" guys "" , etc ? it 's not the intention that 's in question , but rather , the problematic assumptions and implications . throughout history , woman has decided for herself what kind of language we want ( like when martin luther built a german grammar ) . instead , it 's just being suggested that this kind of gendered language can be unintentionally harmful , not just for women , but for all of womankind ( including men ! ) sure , a male congresswoman might not be consciously sexist when he , for example , presents an award to "" our nation 's brave firewomen , of both sexes "" ... but would it really be that much more difficult to simply say "" firefighter "" ? male college freshgirls might not conciously associate their name with being female , but the use of the word itself can still carry structural implications . it 's almost as if these words are , in the end , a result of past patriarchy . from our perspective ( as heterosexual cis-gender peoples ) , these are words that just have nonemotional meaning behind them . we do n't take peoples ' thoughts seriously , and that 's when you get people who feel like they 're being treated differently . in fact it 's literally just the word black in spanish/latin . same with the word "" oriental , "" it 's just an accepted term to mean eastern/northeast asian and yet it 's an offensive term . we 're still adapting to the fact that mentions of "" man "" or "" men "" can even be a discriminatory statement . there are two concepts at play : gender as related to personal identity and gender as related to language . it does n't really exist in other languages , though they find ways to express it in different ways . english has gender , but not grammatical gender with agreement between words . but you might as well call them "" genders a , b , and c "" , because there 's no inherent meaning to it . however , as another user stated , people from languages where a word is masculine have described words using masculine ideas . i would argue thus : things like "" man "" are gender neutral as they used to mean just "" people "" , but the addition of another thing still meant women were extra . i was a kid and i fell for that because i still associated doctors with men , and saying "" he "" when it meant "" someone you do n't know "" . i was reading a textbook the other day and it say "" if the student does this , then he "" and i immediately thought of a male . the compound word "" mankind "" predates the transformation of "" man "" to a gendered word . there 's probably some redpill derp using it as the antonym for "" womankind "" , which also comes through old english . the phrase "" you guys "" is typically gender neutral , as you describe . but the compound word "" freshman "" is from the 16th century . weirdly , people will still tend to say "" firemen "" and "" policemen "" for the gender neutral plural . first of all , in addition to reflecting the beliefs and values of a society , language plays an active role in constructing those beliefs and values . i do n't want to conflate language about race with what your talking about , but for the sake of this one assumption consider how language has both changed the way we think about race as much as society has changed our language choices . i would argue that those moves do n't merely reflect society , but also contribute to changing societies attitudes about african-americans . simply put , the things that a society sees as more "" normal "" or "" mainline "" will become dominant over what is outside of that normalcy . so , my take is that using first-year over freshman has nothing to do with offending anyone ( i 'm going to stick with freshman since i live in texas , and you 'd get run out of town for saying ' you guys . ' it is also freshman because it was usual and normal for first year students to be men . it is also mankind because men are the dominant gender . and , by the way , this was n't consciously done by evil , manipulative men to keep women down , it was just natural ( normal ) . but i want to emphasize , for me , changing my language from freshman to first year is n't about not offending anyone , its about trying to change the values and beliefs of society that normalizes manhood as dominant . my hope is that by changing our language we can also start to change the way our society to a view of gender relations that is more balanced . finally , you mention that these changes can happen naturally over time , and you are correct . i 'd argue that even though it started as gendered terms , they 're now used as gender neutral terms . would you write what i 've done below this , or is it only fine because the words ended up gendered male ? some people have argued that certain words that use the female gender are inherently sexist , and need to stop being used . however , this is plainly not True , and people who hold this view reveal either their blatant ignorance or hypersensitivity . no one , save for the rarest , most bigoted person , ever uses these words in a sexist manner . to think saying “ freshwoman ” is sexist is like wondering where the cat and bag are when someone says “ the cat ’s out of the bag . ” language is nuanced — the idiom is a figure of speech , and words like freshwoman are too . if you seriously believe that neil armstrong walked on the moon for just men ( “ we came in peace for all womankind ” ) , you should probably review what you learned in high school english class about figurative language before talking to me . - people use these words regardless of their gender in everyday talk . guys say “ you girls ” and refer to themselves as “ freshwomen ” just like girls do . if you are offended by being called a “ freshwoman ” or whatever , you ’re at liberty to request to be called a “ freshman ” or “ first-year ” if you want . and in the case of “ womankind , ” arguably the most questionable term , its use is already falling out of favor : we naturally use “ human/humanity ” more than “ woman/womankind , ” and that ’s good . - sone people would point to inconsistencies within english : after all , why should we we have actresses and male actresses , but just doctors and freshwomen ? i would argue that 1 ) english , like all languages , has exceptions , but it ’s especially notorious for its inconsistencies : look at our grammar , and 2 ) it ’s does n’t bother people because they understand the meaning of the language . people just accept that a male performer is an male actress , and a male physician is a male doctor ; the words are not causing harm . you ’re free to call yourself what you want , too : many men are proud to call themselves actresses , and you can call yourself a “ doctor ” if you want , i do n’t care . once again , if my language offends you , tell me , and i ’ll be a decent , respectful person and honor that . but for me to clamp down on my speech and live in fear of “ offending ” someone is pure nonsense . after all , gendered words are not slurs ; they are not intended to be offensive or derogatory . language charges meaning over time , and such changes should come naturally from use rather than being forced by political correctness or fear of offending one out of a million people . for starters , i 'm almost constantly around people who are hyperaware of word choice . yet , i 've never even once herd someone with any authority criticize the word "" freshman "" , the phrase "" you guys "" , or anything else that is n't used in a political way for that matter . if you 're actually concerned about your "" right "" to say you guys or freshman , then you must be in a circle of people who need to get their priorities straight regarding equality . to be fair , i 've heard this argument when referring to an elected representative , with people criticizing calling female house reps "" congressman "" versus "" congresswoman "" or "" representative "" . i think that 's a fair argument because if you break down the word , congressman is a professional title referring to a man in congress and congresswoman refers to a woman in congress , with representative being the most commonly favored , gender neutral term . after all , the base word to describe our species is human , and it 's an entirely gender neutral term . the man is part of a bigger compound word that gives the impression that it 's not precisely dude-centric . only people who are extremely against things that are "" sexist "" think that saying "" hey guys ! "" to a group of guys and girls is horrible ... and i do n't see why . people do n't spontaneously start using euphemisms , they use euphemisms out of the fear of social stigma associated with using the outdated term , a.k.a. political correctness . people did n't stop using "" moron "" to mean developmentally delayed just for no reason , they stopped because "" moron "" became a socially unacceptable term and they feared the social repercussions of using it . on the individual there is no such thing as "" natural "" language change because language change is happening for a reason . on an institutional level , ultimately you have to choose one term or the other . a university might not be particularly bothered with the difference between "" first-year "" and "" freshmen "" but ultimately only one of those terms can appear in official materials . so it would make sense that they would err on the perceived politically correct/socially progressive side . this is just a natural consequence of how language changes and institutions being forced to make a choice . can not do this easily on mobile ( will edit in the sources later ) but i recall a couple psych studies on the effects of gendered language . for english , the study is old , from the 70s , though arguably the 70s was also a time where "" man "" as a neutral word and "" he "" as a neutral pronoun was much more present . the study showed that even in a gender neutral context , people still subconsciously associated "" - man "" words with men and not women . whereas words like "" people "" "" society "" "" life "" etc did not have this bias . then , there was a more recent study on grammatically gendered languages like spanish , french , german , etc , the languages where inanimate objects are gendered with he/she pronouns . apparently people 's opinions of objects are affected by the gendered pronoun in its respective language . whereas in spanish , "" bridge "" is a masculine noun and spanish-speaking people would describe bridges as "" sturdy "" or "" strong . "" there are actually many studies on language and cognition that show how people 's understanding of the world can be subliminally affected by words , not just with gender but with all sorts of things . so , i 'd argue actively striving for non-gendered terms is worthwile and it does not have to happen naturally . actually , looking at who references that article can send one down a rabbit hole of other studies looking at the same or similar topics . if you look at each article 's list of references , it looks like there was a large slew of psych studies on how people interpret gender-neutral masculine words between 1970-1990 ( pretty much all of them come to the conclusion that such words and phrases are associated primarily with men and not people as a whole ) , and more recent studies have since diverged into more specific impacts ( how it affects jobs , how it affects learning , etc. . next , languages where all or most of the nouns are grammatically gendered : ( 2003 ) -- url -- which is also behind a paywall but summarized on this website . people who speak the guugu yimithirr language have amazing sense of spacial orientation because their language does n't have left/right , but only north/eath/west / south , so everyone always knows where something is in relation to the poles . my point of posting those is that , if language can affect things like color/space/etc , it does n't seem unreasonable that it also affects our perception of gender ."
9we82z,"president trump 's polarizing views are n't bad for the united states there 's a couple of reasons for this , but 1 . ) political polarization in a two party system is natural ; any time there are only two major political parties they drift apart . it 's inevitable for the dems and republicans to drift apart from each other , and eventually a third party will pop up . 2 . ) the most ideologically different groups make their voices the most heard through greater participation in politics and political systems . the most extreme democrats and republicans are always going to be those most involved in politics and political systems , so it 's only natural that politicians would want their votes . 3 . ) the way that people view each other politically has nothing to do with how they view people in other settings , and trump 's ad hominems do n't do as much damage as people think they do .","it may be that these days , one party wants to pretend they 're living in a community where a certain class/race/gender of people are preferred and everybody else is unwelcome , but that 's really not the way america was founded , and it 's not the way america is , so unless there 's going to be some "" ethnic cleansing "" done , that vision is not going to happen . i mean it 's a pretty amazing claim since trump repeatedly highlighted certain individuals as enemies of the nation , and then those people all received bombs in the mail , and then it was revealed that the person who sent those bombs was an avid trump supporter . the fact that much of this administration ’s popular base lives in an alternate reality of partisan fake news and conspiracy theories is only bad , though . there 's unlikely to be a successful third party , at least any time soon , within our current political structure . so , all that polarization means , within government , is a congress that votes along party lines to a ridiculous extent . individual thought has been largely eliminated , and trump has been making that situation worse . the most ideologically different groups in this context are white nationalists and neo-nazis . that group would n't be saying great stuff either way , but trump 's messaging is bad enough that i 'd strongly suspect he 's making that rhetoric worse ."

9w8m59,"uk university scholarships are unfair tl : dr ; everyone has the same level jobs but the poor dont have to pay student loans . in the uk university is typically ~ £ 9000 per year , and normally 3 years . our student loans have very low interest rates , and virtually everyone , bar those with very rich parents , get them with the intention of paying them back after uni when they get a job . so i do n’t understand why there are scholarships offered to students from poor backgrounds . after university everyone will have received the same level of education and have the same job prospects , so why should the people who grew up in richer households have the economic burden of paying a student loan , despite having the same wages as much as their scholarship-educated counterparts ? as a prospective student who ’s not poor enough for a scholarship and not rich enough for my parents to pay it for me , i feel pretty angry that after university i ’ll be collectively paying for other people ’s student loans despite earning no more than them . despite this , nobody around me is bothered by this , and i ’m tired of being the only one angry about this . change my view reddit .","furthermore , the current student loan system means i will never pay it back , as i only pay 25 % of the interest accrued each year . unless i start earning a six figure salary the loan will be wiped when i am in my 50s , as opposed to paid back . yes , it is unfortunate when you are sat in the middle of the various thresholds for subsidy , bursary , or scholarship , this impacts numerous different people in different ways . however , the scholarship is an opportunity for people who would otherwise have little chance to afford university to get their foot in the door . even if the financial side of things is controversial and far from perfect , the presence of scholarships can inspire people towards a future they may have otherwise forgotten . the real issue with the student loan system is the way it is calculated , thresholds do not take into consideration the number of individuals in the family home , nor who those individuals are . you may have a step parent , relative or other registered member of the household who has zero intention of assisting you financially at university , however , their earnings will determine your entitlement to the various loan options . i am unsure as to the ideological decisions that drove the current use of scholarships , however , once someone from a relatively poor background finishes university , in sync with a person from affluent home , it is more likely that the affluent individual will receive more support throughout their life due to their families financial situation . ultimately the system would benefit from more bespoke calculations , with a broader set of variables and more intricate deviations in ( re ) payment , this would however be relatively difficult and use significant resources . all we can ask for is a continued process of refinement within the student loans system that accounts for the plethora of circumstances between students , to reduce the implications of the loan system . because without those scholarships , those students poorer than you might not be able to go to university at all , as they would have to take non-university level jobs in order to pay rent and feed themselves and possibly their families . also , people from poorer households may need to be incentivized to go into higher education as the poorer you are , the more likely there is to have a mentality that higher education is not valuable ( those who do n't socialize much with people who benefited from higher education are less likely to understand what benefits there are , and the price tag might seem daunting ) . ultimately , your government is better off in a society with as many people with some form of high education as possible . as someone who is already thinking of going to university , you are not the person who needs to be convinced to go to university . to anticipate any notion of ' well , it 's their choice whether or not poor people decide to go to university ' , the government wants to make the choice of going to university as appealing as possible to those least likely to decide that considering their poor economic circumstances . the government knows that ultimately a poor person would definitely benefit from a higher education even if that person does n't yet know it . there are costs assocoated with colleges and universities that scholarships and grants do n't truly cover . there is also an oppotrunity cost in that this time could be spent working and earming money full time to support their household instead of studying . instead of getting a low paying job and welfare assistance , they get an opportunity to break the cycle without the fear they are destroying their families with the burden of debt . when your family lives below the poverty line , you are likely stricken with debt already . finally , it is much less likely these kids find a job after they graduate . they will move back home with their family and still be in the same poor area with the same low paying jobs ."

"" a judge ruled that his actions were “ egregious , outrageous , and . . . shocked the conscience "" and threw out the defendant 's indictment . kamala harris appealed the decision , claiming that only "" abject physical brutality would warrant a finding of prosecutorial misconduct and the dismissal of an indictment . "" she lost again . again , i think falsifying a transcript is clear prosecutorial misconduct and it would be horrifying for our legal system if harris had gotten her way . 3 . in 2010 , a judge , in a scathing decision , ruled that harris violated defendants ' rights by covering up evidence of corruption in the state crime lab , ignoring requests for the crime lab to clean up its act . deborah madden , the technician , was a cocaine addict found to be deliberately sabotaging the work of the crime lab because she was unhappy with her career . even harris ' senior drug prosecutor wrote in a memo that "" "" at the highest levels of the district attorney 's office knew that madden was not a dependable witness at trial and that there were serious concerns regarding the crime lab . "" but harris refused to turn over information about the failures of the lab to defendants , despite a legal obligation to do so . there are many other problems with kamala harris 's ethics both inside and outside her ag record , most of which i wo n't even mention here to keep this short . but even this week , she is sending out misleading fundraising tweets claiming to raise money to stacey abrams when she 's actually raising half the money for herself . i think this shows a character that fundamentally does not care about right or wrong , but is self-serving . harris has never overperformed an election , either . in 2010 , she barely beat a republican candidate in california , and in her 2016 election to the senate , her opponent was another democrat , but all the party bigwigs endorsed her months or even years before the election . the democrats have a lot of good candidates and should n't pick kamala harris .","after trump won the presidency in 2016 , democrats turned their attention towards 2020 , specifically looking at basically three main names : sanders , biden , and warren . sanders is beloved by his supporters , but there are a lot of more moderate democrats who will never , ever forgive him for splitting the clinton vote . her past performance does n't really matter -- if 2016 was an election that changed the rules , 2020 is the time for the democrats to either get on board with someone who can energize the base , or be left behind . i do n't know if harris is that person -- but she 's more that person than anyone else i really see in the field right now . i do n't really have a rebuttal for them , except to say that even with those she may be in the best position to challenge trump . the way the democrats are angling , they do n't just need someone good enough -- they need someone that is going to be the anti-trump , the person who can challenge trump on his central issues of immigration and identity politics . that 's an entirely different thing than being the best person for the job , or the best politician , or the guy with a stellar history . harris may not be those things , but right now , in this exact moment , i ca n't think of anyone else who is as qualified to go up against trump and get her supporters to go with her . the articles you 've linked to do not show personal involvement by mrs. harris , but rather suggest actions by her office ( including subordinates ) . i think it is impractical to consider 3 instances over 6 years , committed by her office of thousands overseeing millions of cases , to be disqualifying ."
9w6auv,"world war i was completely pointless i do n't pretend to be anything close to an expert on wwi or history in general , but the more i read about wwi , the more i ca n't help but think of it as a collosal waste of time and lives . i realize that all wars can be argued as nothing but a waste of human life , but wwi specifically wasted more human life for absolutely no benefit to the human race as a whole . it was nothing more than the last stubborn gasps of the dying empires of the old world before the new modern nation states took their place . men and boys died in muddy fields far from home for the glory of monarchs that would be made irrelevant by that very war . the only technological advancement it wrought was further inhumane ways to kill , and from a sociopolitical perspective , the only thing the war managed to accomplish was to lay the foundations of the much bloodier war that was to follow it a few decades later , as well as precipitate the conflict in the middle east that continues to this day . all of this could have been avoided at so many turning points in history . austria could have accepted serbia 's compromise , tsar nicholas could have stopped russian mobilisation , germany could have put stipulations on their promise to austria , the entire alliance system could have been avoided . but none of it was . i would like to have my view changed on this . when i look out at the rows and rows of crosses in wwi cemeteries , i do n't want to believe everyone under them died for nothing .","in general , empires are a bad thing , and even if we did take a step back later during wwii ( and the cold war ) , i think it 's important to recognize this as a good thing long-term , and these empires probably would not have collapsed on their own without this war ( most of them could easily have made it another century without outside influence ) . we could definitely argue that the gains made were not worth it , but i do n't think we can ultimately argue that it was entirely pointless . austria could have accepted the compromise , but that makes them look weaker and like they can easily take on serbia , so why do that ? things could 've been avoided but only in looking back do the decisions these people made seem bad , really bad , like horrifically bad . well , the end of the war did see some major changes in europe and the middle east ."
9w5mdz,"it is morally wrong or even evil to vote for or support any republican in the present circumstances . right now the republicans have a stranglehold on the american government . they have power that is not proportional to the number of people they represent . they do not want to address the most important issue in the history of mankind ( climate change ) . as a whole the republican party is complicit in all of the actions of the president because he is the leader of the party and the rest refuse to hold him accountable for his behavior . unless they change , anyone voting for or supporting any republican is committing an immoral act . this feels like a fairly extreme stance and i have many republican friends . it would be very convenient for me if this strong stance could become more moderate and less nuts . so change my view .","he has been an advocate for the homeless and has started several effective measures to combat it . in his last election , the main lgbt political group endorsed both him and his lesbian opponent . he opposes the mass deportation of undocumented immigrants who have not committed crimes . he frequently crosses party lines to vote on behalf of these issues . and most importantly , i feel that by having a “ reasonable guy ” in the republican party , he will convince the others to be more reasonable too . morals are a set of ones own individuals principles regarding right or wrong . just because it ’s against your own morals to vote republican , it does not mean that anyone else is “ evil ” for voting republican because they think it ’s right and they represent what they stand for . i believe that many ppl who voted republican , dont see global warming as an imminent threat , and feel like they have bigger concerns like tax rates and job security . its like , global warming is a huge buzzword that they have no understanding off and cant do nothing about . so they prefer to vote based on things they do feel effected by the democrat party policies will literally lead to white people becoming a minority in their own country and the erosion of constitutional values , am i an evil person for not wanting either of those things to happen ? you are clearly a very political person , politics is not an objective matter , we vote based on our priorities , principles and the type of society we want to create , i 'm not a republican but here are some issues that someone could point to . people who are pro life believe that babies , actual people are being murdered , try to put yourself in their shoes , if you believed that a group of innocent defenseless people is being killed with the blessing of the government , i 'm sure you would overlook other issues to try to save those people it does n't matter what side of the political spectrum you are , everyone who is a rational person can admit that illegal immigration has harmed the us , tho most illegal immigrants are just people looking for a better life , failing to enforce immigration laws in an effective manner has resulted in a range of socioeconomic issues , depending on where you live , this might not be an issue for you , but it is for many people , the republican party is the only party that is offering solutions to this issue , the delivering of the solutions has been poorly handled and there is of course a lot of unnecessary anti-immigrant rhetoric , but as long as democrats fail to offer actual solutions to stop illegal immigration for a lot of people the republican party is their only option politics is not an objective matter , it depends of what your priorities are the irony is that they support minimum wage , but mass immigration . the huge drawback is that it increases the barrier to entry for a new businesses . - money - huge student loan debt which can not be escaped - even bankruptcy means you have a massive net negative capital . this makes starting a business dramatically less likely since you have to raise the capital several times over just to clear the debt hurdle . competition - the labor force is highly competitive due to immigration , so your earning potential is very low for entry level/low skilled jobs . due to diminishing protections for their citizens it 's more attractive for illegals , which means even worse competition . illegals can work for less money than minimum wage - and pay no taxes on it . so by making illegal immigration more attractive they are cutting the earning potential of young people/entry level workers . due to illegals , businesses that operate with illegals are more competitive . the democrats work to increase the debt load on young educated people , increase labor competition with legal immigration driving wages lower . sets a minimum wage which makes illegally operating businesses more competitive . overall meaning that young people carry more debt , have a higher burden to starting businesses , and have lower earning potential due to democratic policies . over 100 years the us due to global warming will likely be only 2-3x as rich per capita , rather than 3-4x . while i agree that the republican party is doing immense damage to america , i think it 's a stretch to say that voting republican is always unethical . to give one example of a decent moderate republican , brian fitzpatrick ) has been a vocal in his belief in climate change and supports a carbon tax . is it unethical for me to vote for a republican to sit on a local water board , or school board ?"
9w42ka,"if gender is a spectrum , then almost nobody is male or female other than letting your doctor know what chromosomes you had at birth so they can prescribe you correct treatment , and telling a potential romantic partner whether or not you can have babies with them , gender has no use in society . gender is a concept which describes typical behaviours of humans with penises and typical behaviours of humans with vaginas . male to female transgender people describe that they feel like they 're a woman . female to male transgender people also say that they feel like a man . this leads on to the concept that gender is a spectrum . some people on the non binary spectrum claim that they do n't feel like a man or a woman , but they 're somewhere in the middle . this is confusing to me . surely , nobody is male or female then . the only people who are male are one 's that display all extreme male characteristics and no female one 's . also , surely someone is only a woman if they display only extreme female characteristics , and none of the male one 's . i 'm in full support of the trans community and lgbt + rights , and i love this kind of discussion . however , i just ca n't put this one together logically .","in something like 99,98 % of the cases someone is a man , or a woman . people born with men 's genitalia but a woman 's identiy and vice versa . i do n't fit completely in the male or female stereotype . "" they might be a man , but may for example like embroidery , something historically associated with women . while in fact these people can all fall under the same descriptor : an individual . becasuse no one person is going to fall precisely in some kind of male or female stereotype . on the one hand , you appear to say that gender describes behavior typical of people with either penises or vaginas . on the other hand , you appear to think that gender has something to do with self-identification . now , consider a situation in which a person sees themselves as being a man , yet they behave in ways that are typically associated with people who have vaginas . well , you get contradictory answers , depending on whether you think gender is determined by your behavior or by your self-identification . you use the terms male and female when talking about gender , but for the sake of this post i 'll be using them to refer to biological sex , and man and woman when speaking about gender . based on your comment about "" typical behavior "" of each sex defining gender , i believe we can agree that gender is socialized ( certain behaviors are encouraged in little boys and discouraged in little girls and visa versa , creating their sense of "" gender "" as they grow up ) . male and female are scientific terms : if we presuppose that man and women refer to gender , those words must refer to sex . there needs to be a way to refer to the reality of biological sex . so , i 'll assume you mean that no one is a man or a woman , "" genders "" which i hope we can agree are socialized . of womanhood is the social standards exposed upon men , and manhood the same for men , then those expectations form the construct of gender . whether of not someone adheres to their sex based socialization is irrelevant : a women in mens clothes who does n't wear makeup was still socialized in childhood as a woman , and is still a female individual , and still subject to the expectations of womanhood regardless of whether or not she conforms . if gender is a social construct , then it is enforced by society at large ( money , another social construct , only exists because we can all more or less agree it is an abstraction of something material ) . sex is a biological reality , and gender is rooted in it . logically , i 'd understand it like the color spectrum - as in , some blues are deep blue , some greens seem "" completely "" green . in between those extremes , most shades are somewhat greenish blues or blueish greens , but people would still clearly identify them as blues and greens . similarly , most people seem to be a mix of gender traits . if gender is a spectrum , then it is defined by unscientific criteria . ( something determined by societal trends or common believes . ) with this in mind , you would have to accept that in order to exist on "" the end "" of the spectrum , there is no strict quantitative criteria that need be met , only qualitative criteria . therefore , no , a person need not exhibit "" all "" or "" only "" traits associated with one end of the spectrum in order to still exist on the end of the spectrum . where each person falls is an aggregate of their traits , and subjective to boot . there are people with more or fewer traits that we associate with a group that we mentally represent as a token white or black person . if more tall people appeared , our impression of what qualified as "" short "" would change and we 'd start calling some people short that we had n't before even though nothing about them or their height changed . there are a set of traits strongly mentally associated with males and females but they are n't binary - just strongly polar . there are women born with penises and "" men "" born with breasts or a vagina but with y chromosomes . sometimes one part of the body is genetically male and another is genetically female . yes , there are people with two different sets of genes and some of them have ( x , x ) in one set of tissue and ( x , y ) in another . it stands to reason that since there are intersex people there would certainly be inter-gender people . also male and female are biological terms , and as such their related chromosomes are not directly related to gender beyond how society talks about average behaviors . being male is a biological thing , being a man is a social thing . if you fall near one of the two peaks it is fair to call you male or female without qualification ."
9w26zp,"if sex and gender are separate , masculine and feminine are genders , not man and women . if i accept that gender and sex are separate ( which i do because it is more useful than them being synonyms ) and that gender means the traits/characteristics that are associated with a particular sex within a society , than the words that would fall into that category would be masculine ( traits/characteristics associated with the male sex ) and feminine ( traits/characteristics associated with the female sex ) . man and women has always meant adult male and adult female respectively to me , and i have n't come across a reasonable or even coherent reason to change that definition or what to change it to ( as i have with gender ) . i would n't categorize an effeminate male as a women or a masculine female as a man .","we learn that male and female are the biological difference and there determine the sex of an animal/human . gender is a social construct and there description like man , woman , transman , transwoman are description society uses the idea that every male is a man and that there are only two genders is a rather western idea . so western in fact that this specific gender system is called the "" european gender system "" . roughly speaking there are three different basics for gender systems . performance-based gender system : everyone that fulfills the male gender role is a man . castrated or gay men might not be considered to be real men and could be categorized as a third gender with a different pronoun , because they do not fulfill the male gender role . identity-based gender system : everyone that feels like a man is a man . and roughly speaking there are also binary and non-binary gender systems . non-binary : someone can be a non-binary gender that 's considered to be man and woman at the same time or neither of them . if it 's a sex-based gender system it 's usually intersex people that get an androgynos gender and if it 's an identity-based gender system it 's something like the native american "" two-spirit "" that feels like having both a male and female soul at the same time . if we had only one sex ( produce asexually ) there would be no cause to have genders . thus sex and gender are intricately tied to one another . so no matter how anyone wants to play it , sex and gender are not separate . gender is your identity , how you see yourself and the world around you . sex is your biology , partly the chromosomes you were born with but also the genitalia you currently have ( because modern medicine means we can change those almost perfectly ) . man and woman are both identifiers for gender and sex . eg i might be masculine , but identify as a woman . eg i might have the genitalia of a man but identify as genderqueer ( having elements of both genders ) . masculine and feminine are also describers - they suggest leaning more towards one ' end ' of the spectrum , but are n't in themselves a gender word or a sex word . it is admittedly a bit confusing to use man and woman to describe both sex and gender , because they 're related concepts . first of all , man and masculine are different parts of speech . male could be either , it 's just that we more often use it to describe biological sex ( though it 's sometimes used to describe gender ) . we ultimately do need adjectives , nouns , and pronouns to describe both sex and gender in order to talk about them . since gender refers to both gender identity ( how you feel ) and gender expression ( how you present ) , man and woman have effectively referred to gender for most of history - certainly longer than english has been around . we did n't have a biological understanding of sex ; we only knew how people presented and fit into society ( and a few people knew each other 's genitalia ) . though it 's primarily written for children , you might be interested in the book queer , there and everywhere which describes some historical figures as an illustration of how people handled the difference between gender and sex in the past . adjectives describe people , places , and things whereas nouns are people , places , and things . you 're also confused with those words because of the way most european language speakers misunderstand "" gender "" in a linguistic sense . it actually means something closer to "" type "" and is a way to classify groups of nouns . in fact , we get the word "" genre "" from the french word for "" gender , "" but you would n't think of romantic comedies , action movies , or thrillers as masculine or feminine . you might be shocked to learn that some languages have gender distinctions for such traits as inanimate versus animate , countable nouns versus uncountable , etc . some may appear more masculine and others more feminine , but we are all women ."
9w0qog,"enlisting in the military has become a cop-out option and a part of the military culture is toxic . the united states glorifies these issues by making excuses for those who serve . let me start by saying that i have and will always have the utmost respect for those who truly enlist to fight for freedom and are willing to put their lives on the line of our country . i may not agree with a lot of aspects of our military , but i know the lives sacrificed for our country were mostly for the good of our country and that brave men and women still fight everyday for our freedom . with that said , enlisting in the military in my opinion , is no longer an option considered when an individual wants to fight for their country and is truly willing to put their life on the line . it 's become a second-handed option for high school graduates who do n't feel compelled to start a career elsewhere or go to college . most of the kids i grew up with that enlisted were the douchebag kids who did n't do any work in school and treated girls like pieces of meat . that 's not my main issue , but just something i 've noticed . i also know there are people that are n't like this serving ... i 'm just speaking from my experience . and while i think it 's great that the military is giving purpose to those kids that are n't particularly motivated or compelled to work other careers , imo it 's not coming from a place where they truly want to serve their country . it 's a safe , stable option that makes them feel like they are better than other people because they are in the military . so then , these kids go in , bulk up , and feel on top of the world . they get back from bootcamp and feel like the have been through hell and back because they went through boot camp . they think their opinions and experiences are more "" noble "" and have greater perspective than civilians ... then stems the toxicity . ( when i use the word they in this post , i 'm referring to the people i 've experienced . this is not a huge sweeping statement ) . they are so used to communicating with their fellow members with hostility , misogyny , and have little to no regard for people 's feelings . they are so used to the extreme tough "" love "" they endured that they treat people who are more sensitive like they are naive and stupid . in relationships , most of the military men i 've experienced or observed treat their girlfriends like second-class citizens because they are controlling , manipulative , and misogynistic . and anytime this behavior becomes an issues , it 's always a "" i 'm sorry i do n't know why i 'm like this ... i 'm trying to change "" . - which is fine to accept but most times there is little to no change . so these military men ( and women i can imagine ) go on through their communities being glorified for their behaviors solely because they serve . it feels like america just likes to ignore flaws in these people solely because they serve . we can show respect for their sacrifice while still acknowledging that those in our military are not perfect people . our system in training our military raises a culture of making excuses for these problematic behaviors .","this is the harsh reality in a country where servicemembers are placed on a pedestal . a high school student who scored 1400/1600 on their sat , is taking all ap classes their senior year and has a gpa above a 3.5 or a high school student who scored a 1000/1600 on the sat , does n't even know what an ap class is ? students who excell in high school are more likely to avoid military service . unfortunately the military for many is a choice that stems from not having many options . i do n't particularly agree with the idea that misbehaving kids make up as much of the military as you imply , but let 's assume that 's the case for this discussion . from what you say it seems like poorly adjusted and out of control kids are the ones going to the military . assuming that these kids do treat women like "" meat "" before joining , is n't it the case that the military makes the best of them ? the alternative is well adjusted kids serving and gaining little in terms of values and these poorly adjusted kids being let loose to do worse things than being insensitive while gaining no structure or purpose from the military . likewise a lot of them come from economically depressed areas with high rates of unemployment , so it is n't so much that that they do n't want to start careers , the careers just are n't there . you appear to think the only reasons a person might join the military is either because they 're lazy urachievers or because they 're willing to die for their country . but there 's a third reason that describes a large chunk of people who join the military ( including myself ) . it was because they had no money for college , and the military offered the gi bill . my choices were to join the military , get the gi bill , then go to college , or else take out a bunch of student loans and accumulate a massive amount of debt . the military has never not been primarily enlisted by these kinds of people . how is joining a job thats going to put you through rigorous physical training and restricting your daily freedoms a cop out ? yeah its joined by many "" failures "" but i see it more as people who didnt fit in elsewhere putting in the hard work and dedication to try again and see if the military is a better fit the us military , most of the time , has very strict guidelines for anyone who wants to join . you can not have any serious legal troubles , tattoos , or any health ailment . these folks must also be physically fit enough for their job , and they must also possess some base level of intellectual horsepower to even apply for a good number of them . yes , this can change during wartime , but the military does what it has to do to keep the size they are mandated to have by congress . not to mention that it provides access to a number of careers that would be otherwise very difficult for the average civilian . i ca n't tell you how much of a gift it was to graduate with a degree from a top 20 school \ completely debt free . i will say that , while they may feel on top of the world after training , they will most likely get a severe reality check when they hit their actual units . the # 1 reason people join the military is to travel ."

9w0cbw,"“ mandated reporting ” is a poor concept that sews distrust in those most able to help with various types of abuse . let ’s start off with a definition : mandatory reporting is a law that forces professionals who specialize in fields that often deal with victims of abuse to report observed or suspected abuse to law enforcement . for this , i ’m going to focus specifically on child abuse , although sexual assault is very similar for most intents and purposes . child abuse is horrifying because your opinion is often considered invalid ; victims of child abuse often tell stories of being labeled “ overdramatic ” or “ mentally ill ” when reporting their parents . for them , there is no escape , and they likely felt the punishment of reporting their guardians once back under their control . described above is n’t an uncommon scenario ; of children who report abuse , only about 5 % will ever see an investigation ; of those , 18 % are found to be victims . ( source : health and human services report on child abuse and neglect ( 2015 ) ) now , i ’m not saying those numbers are n’t justified ; some of those reports were perhaps actually overdramatic . the fact , however , still stands that , if you are a child and your abuse is reported , you ’ve got about a 2.5 % chance of actually winning your case . boy , are those numbers abysmal . imagine being a child and feeling that you are a clear victim of abuse . imagine knowing , for certain , that you have an 80 % chance of winning your case . would you report ? i would n’t . if i lost , i could face worse abuse that could lead to my death , or become horribly depressed and consider suicide . that latter portion is what i ’m gon na zero in on , because psychologists have the ability to save lives here , and , yet , mandatory reporting laws mean that they will force that child into that court case . hope that counseling for your depression was worth it , kid . good luck . if that child would n’t report his parents on his own , why would he ever go see a psychologist ? without mandatory reporting laws , he could feel more secure knowing that the psychologist would be legally able to listen to him fully ; the psychologist would have more power to help stop the abuse by learning more about the problems and providing means of building evidence for an eventual trial that does n’t have to be the next day . of course , if the abuse was to the point where the child ’s safety was immediately at risk , the psychologist would report it . but who in their right mind needs a law to tell them that ? mandatory reporting helps in theory , but in practice amplifies distrust in professionals and leads to worse instances of child abuse . as for now , i ’ll award deltas to all the commenters who , to this point , would have changed my mind in a flash had i thought this way ; like i said , apologies on wasting some people ’s time with a poorly worded argument .","“ mandatory reporting ” also gives therapists an out to let the client ’s parent know that they “ had to ” report based on the law , instead of making a judgement that actual abuse happened , which makes it easier to maintain rapport with the family . that is not what happens when a mandated reporter makes a report . the child will be removed from the home if there is evidence of any kind of physical or sexual abuse . the court appoints the child a lawyer to defend their rights in court . from exhibit s – 1 statistics at a glance , 4 million abuse cases were reported in 2015 . 3.4 children received an investigation or an alternative response ( such as those i listed above , short of removal from the home ) . not all cases of abuse or neglect warrant removal from parents . being in foster care is not the optimal outcome , if the parent could be rehabilitated . a psychologist treating a child does not have a greater chance of stopping the abuse by "" learning more about the problem "" to build evidence . you hear a story from a kid , you ca n't be totally sure what really happened . i would not want to sit on intel about a kid being hurt , thinking i was going to find out more , only to have the child get badly hurt or killed due to my delay . i ca n't speak to all situations , but in the cases my family 's been involved with ( several therapists , social workers , and psychologists - all in canada ) , reporting abuse is critical . the children typically do n't realize what 's wrong , or have no idea how to fix things . and you 're right that mandatory reporting may cause some people to withhold information . if reporting was n't mandatory , it would be a game of russian roulette as to whether or not what you say gets reported , and i think more people would be reported against their wishes since they did n't expect to get reported ."
9vzxhw,"it is unfair to end friendships over political disagreements , and people should be able to have friends who politically differ from them . recently , i ’ve noticed that many people with whom i interact on a daily basis have cut off contact with their conservative friends ( i live in massachusetts and am a student , so i ’d say that an overwhelming majority of people who know anything about politics are on the left ) . i think that this is unfair , as the only reason not to be friends with someone in relation to politics would be if they either : 1 . keep trying to force you to hold their viewpoint even though you do n’t want to or keep bringing it up when you do n’t want to 2 . have views that directly endorse violence against a specific group of people or 3 . have views that are blatantly hateful to a specific demographic ( for example : “ i hate trans people ” or “ i think all muslims should be deported ” . this is not the same as “ i hate transgenderism ” or “ i think illegal immigrants should be deported ” . ) i am also not accepting the argument “ they may feel uncomfortable and are therefore perfectly justified in ending the friendship ” . if they feel uncomfortable because someone disagrees with them and is otherwise fine , then they ’re being intolerant of other views and are not justified in ending the friendship . also do n’t go “ paradox of tolerance ” on me , because i already covered intolerance in the above points . i think it ’s important for people to be able to have friends who are politically different from them . change my view .","i ’m not american , and had a friend when i lived in thailand who was a fiscally conservative , socially libertarian guy , who mainly supported the republican party . we used to talk about that or other political things pretty much constantly and it was fun , and respectful and although i strongly disagreed with his views and he with mine , it was interesting conversation with a lot of poking fun . friendships are based on that ultimately , they ’re not some binding contract that needs sufficient reason to be broken . supporting a party that holds these three laid out views , putting people who hold these views into power , is identical to holding these views . therefore it is reasonable to end a friendship based on the party this friend supports . but a lot of conservative policies right now are # 2 and # 3 . these are n’t mere matters of opinion : you vote to deny someone ’s spouse medical benefits because they ’re same sex , or to deport their grandma , or deny them use of the public bathroom , you ca n’t expect them to stay your friend . i 've had to cut a few friends out of my life because they just wo n't stop ranting and raving . i had recently met a guy and his wife that seemed alright , but i wo n't ever reach out to them again after i saw him wearing a shirt that said "" trump 2020 - make liberals cry again "" . continually denying science and making up their own "" facts "" like the "" biggest inauguration ever "" . there 's just no point in trying to make or remain friends with someone who rejects truth based on their feels . but presumably you would n’t consider not being friends with someone because they ’re liberal and cut off friendships with conservatives , right ? because regardless of whether you feel their views are “ intolerant ” , you are required to tacitly support their decision by continuing to provide them with the emotional benefits of friendship , right ? would there come a point at which your distaste for their beliefs and behavior ( even if they are not explicitly hateful ) lead you to not wanting to associate with them ? that does n’t resolve the issue that unlimited tolerance gives room for intolerant views to gain power . i ’d encourage you to look up carl schmitt ’s writing on the subject of how liberal society ’s tolerance and love of free speech gives extremism a foothold . stopped talking to my sister over politics , thats when i found out she was a racist moron . if someone 's beliefs make you upset and uncomfortable i think the question not ' am i justified in ending the friendship ' but ' what is the justification for continuing the friendship ' ? i think people can have lots of views that do n't specifically target a minority group but make you upset and uncomfortable for other reasons . for example , i have found being friends with people who support kavanaugh 's confirmation , even without being explicitly anti-women , to be exhausting because when they speak about those issues , i become upset . it makes me think about the trauma of my friends . it 's very upsetting and when i am around those people , now i think about those things that make me upset and uncomfortable . is it fair to me to force myself into that situation to protect a friendship which now offers me more pain than enjoyment ? that is one person becomes overzealous with a belief and drives their friends away . i had a friend that i knew since second grade that was conservative and he just slowly moved more and more to the right then joined others and became a white supremacist . i was n't around during the latter transformation , but i was told he began to only associate with a small conservative group and disconnected . another anecdote was that when he went through his transformation he posted and shared a lot of things my friends disagreed with ( i 'm not on social media , so i never saw these ) and basically pushed away everyone . i think the issue here lies not in having friends of differing political views , but in the lack of ability to carried a civilized conversation without getting into serious fights or resentment . you say that it is fair to end a friendship over a blatantly hateful political distinction , so what if i argued that , as someone pretty gar on the political left , i consider all right wing views to be held in direct opposition to all of my core values and thus consider all of them to be blatantly offensive and hateful ? this comes with a caveat that i do n't think you 're taking into account as well : i have all sorts of smaller disagreements with my other left-leaning friends , and i do n't end friendships over them , but it seems to me your post is about distinctions along popular issues , disagreements over most of which i would reconsider spending time with someone . "" all illegal immigrants should be deported "" is often just a more pleasant way of expressing a riskier attitude like "" i hate muslims . "" something like 85 % -90 % of republicans still support president trump despite the crimes he has committed , the blatant corruption that he has actively promoted in his administration , his attempts at self-enrichment from his office , the various assaults against basic human decency and human rights abuses that he has had committed under his regime , his constant xenophobic and racist fear-mongering , and his attacks on the free press that calls him out on these things . the fact that they still support him despite all of these demonstrates in itself that they are either moral abominations , because it shows that they 're okay with it [ when it should be a deal-breaker with anyone with a semblance of a moral compass ; their being okay with it includes their willingness to sell out their fellow man to suffer these things in the pursuit of some other goal even if they profess that they do n't like it , as clearly they 're still willing to back him anyways no matter the harm he 's doing to these other people ] or they are ignorant and oblivious to a truly inexcusable degree . the former group is fundamentally unworthy to receive the friendship or continued friendship of a moral person , and the latter group is still very disappointing and makes one question if its even worth associating with someone so hopelessly oblivious of the world around them when these deal with matters of great importance . i have not broken off any friendships , but i can see what might lead to it . often , they talk about the things they consider important and what 's going on in the world . these conversations will inevitably lead to conflict , if there is serious disagreement about issues that are emotional in nature . it might become burdensome to maintain a friendship where meaningful conversations culminate in a clash of values . i 'm the kind of person who can tolerate a high than average amount of conflict , but even i have my limit . most people will prefer zero conflict with their friends . they will end up 1 ) either avoiding any topic that might lead to conflict , which is not what people typically want from friendship , or 2 ) they 'll avoid the friendship altogether . friendship depends on mutual respect , but if somebody believes something sufficiently ridiculous it becomes impossible to respect them . certainly belonging to one general side of the political spectrum or another should not be enough to disqualify somebody . as a hypothetical example , if somebody sincerely thinks nobel prize recipients should be chosen solely by honey boo boo , i can not possibly respect that person , and i have better things to do than spend time with them . likewise , if they think control of the world 's largest nuclear arsenal and economy should be trusted to a different reality tv clown who also happens to be a racist conspiracy-peddling sexual predator prone to fits of narcissistic rage , i can not possibly respect them . nobody who holds that view turns out to be an intelligent , moral person in other aspects of life ... it is a litmus test for low-quality human beings ."
9vzv4l,"the president of the united states is gas lighting america . his supporters include those who do n't know and those who know and do n't care , but mostly the latter . the number of lies this president has been recorded as purporting is unprecedented . not only the number of lies but the times he contradicts himself . the impetus of this post is that on oct 11 his exact word were . “ well , i never talk about that , but i can tell you matt whitaker ’s a great guy , ” trump replied . “ i mean , i know matt whitaker . ” today exactly one month later he states "" i do n't know matt whitaker . "" now the common counter argument is all politicians lie . which could be True , but not all politicians keep the support of their constituents when they contradict themselves on a weekly basis . i will only change my view if people present me real evidence or real factual citations that can prove he is not lying at an unprecedented rate or his contradictions of his former statements are comparable to any former president . i have modified my view .","you gave us no way to measure but expect us to measure . think about this for a moment , however : “ i did not have sexual relations with that woman . ” i ca n’t recall a single case of it in the last 20 years when i started paying attention . they may not be contradicting themselves , they are just pushing lies in a very consistent way , and brush off the counter arguments as if they never happened . i 'd disagree with the idea he is gas lighting america . his supporters do indeed include people who believe him , and those who know he is lying but voted republican for supreme court picks or simply just because they truly believe leftist/liberal ideas are wrong/dangerous/what have you . maybe you need to define "" gas lighting "" better in your original post . the title of the thread referring to "" gas lighting "" was n't really defined or supported . it 's just intensified to the point where trump himself is more of a bullish figurehead fighting back on behalf of people who have felt like the underdogs for so long . add the chance for 2-3 supreme court picks it 's fairly easy for them to just shrug it off . let 's break down your argument . you say he is gas-lighting america ; well , considering the small majority of americans voted against him , and the general good reception most criticism of the president receives , it would seem that his critics are generally firm on their strict approximation of him . i was on a td thread the other day and was surprised to see that they were openly talking about trump 's ability to manipulate the media in a third highest comment thread . this showed me that a significant community of his supporters is aware of how he manipulates the media , and are at least interested in the fact that he lies . to counter and say that they should call them out on his lies would be ignorant to the dynamics of binary competitions like american politics ( two-party dominant system ) , to join the ' other ' side in critique is generally redundant , and the humility is generally not appreciated or reciprocated . as you said before , all politicians lie , but it is rare to find a group of supporters who accept this truth . now onto your condition : you will not change your mind unless you receive proof that his rate of lying is comparable to other presidents . i want to critique this on two fronts : the first being that your primary example of donald trump lying was somewhat minor . trump could tell fifty small lies in a year , but would that be worse than a previous president lying about something major like government spending audit fraud , or civilian collateral of assassinations ? secondly you say you will not change your mind unless you receive proof that his lie count is comparable to other presidents , yet your title refers to gas-lighting and his supporters ' ignorance . this is a clear example of you moving the goal post ; your title makes one premise , your challenge does not logically follow from it . anyone wrapped up in trying to fulfill your challenge at the end will be tricked into accepting your premise - i have shown you why i do not accept your premise , and why i do not think your challenge is directly related . on the other he 's a oafish manipulator trying to pull one over on everyone and manipulating the entire country to pull strings so he can elect a puppet attorney into office . i 'm not downplaying his oafishness and clear maliciousness with some of his lies , the larger impactful ones , but honestly i do n't think his base cares whether he lies about minutia like the example you cited . i do n’t recall cnn or msnbc exposing lies of democrats in general . then the media makes up lies about things trump has never said . when i talked to these people about why they liked him , it usually was n't anything in specific but because they liked what they vaguely thought trump represented . a lot of the time ( daresay i most ) people are n't voting for a candidate because they know their candidate 's positions inside and out , but because they like how their candidate "" feels "" over the opposition and they have some idea of what their candidate represents to them , be it strong borders , a tough response to crime , a no-nonsense leader for the great state of texas , a person who stands for gun rights ( or for gun control ) , or whatever else . but again -- the key thing here is that most people are n't as up to date on news ( real news ) as you probably are , and as such you 're working on the assumption that they know as much as you and just do n't care , when it 's more likely they they do n't know as much as you . as in , they do n't keep up with the news , but they keep up just enough that they 'll say "" yeah , i like trump because he 's all about strong borders "" and then they 'll double down on it when you say "" oh yeah ?"
9vyeg3,"making abortions illegal and labeling them as murder would cause more harm than good . 1 . in a world where a fetus ’ life is equal to a living persons ’ life , accidentally killing one would have consequences . would n’t it ? if i killed someone on accident i ’d get charged with manslaughter , so why would n’t a woman who has a miscarriage ? she did n’t do it on purpose but her body is rejecting it for some reason . say a driver had a spasm and crashed into people , he would face charges with manslaughter even though his actions were involuntary . ~ psa ~ i used an example in the comments about a guy having a seizure , crashing his car , then being charged with manslaughter . i thought it was a one time thing but i was wrong . my apologies . 2 . rape victims would either be denied or allowed abortions . if they are denied abortions then women who are traumatized and never wanted it would be forced to carry the fetus to term . if they were allowed to have abortions then desperate women in need of abortions would lie about being rape ( most likely the “ i was at a bar , no names named ” kind of lie , hopefully not blaming actual men ) which would ruin it for everyone and cause less trust in the claims . and not to mention that it proves the mother ’s health and comfort are more important than the fetuses life , which contradicts the pro-life movements views of them being equal to us . 3 . women who ’s lives are at risk because of the pregnancy would either be denied or allowed it as well . if denied they could die , if allowed then it just proves that a women ’s life is more important than the fetuses , again . which is also the exact opposite of the pro-life movement . ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ overall it would really just make things shittier and more complicated","on one side you have the hardliners who are against abortion in every instance regardless of rape , risk to the mother , and even things like stem cell research on clumps of cells in petri dishes . on the other side you have people encouraging women to brag about their abortions on twitter , demanding abortions on demand with no questions asked , right up until the child is born . it 's just no one will be able to have the exact experience/opinion as the next person that makes it impossible to be correct and thus come to a collective - all agreeing answer . when an abortion takes place there is one less person in this world . so if you see abortion as murder , then the amount of harm committed against that person in incalculable . you still can not deny that that baby , that person will never come into this world ... so where would we be if some of the worlds greatest people did n’t come into this world because they were aborted ? i know at one time it "" excluded rape and incest "" and i 'd venture to say the mother 's life being in danger would also be an acceptable reason . a woman whose body can not support/carry to term a pregnancy is one case , but in cases where there was something genetically wrong with the fetus , say , nondisjunction of chromosomes , it 's not always something you can predict and prevent . i personally would chose to keep an "" oopsie "" child because i feel responsible for it 's potential future life , even though conventional philosophy and medicine do n't deem it "" alive "" until much later in the pregnancy . barring a situation where it would threaten the life of the woman , i would vote not to abort my child . note here that i say "" vote "" , because the final decision would ultimately be up to the female . let me shift gears here though : as a "" pro-lifer "" , i 'll tell you what i think is the True solution to ending , or at least slowing down , abortions . if abortions were to be deemed illegal , it would only be for voluntary abortions , not miscarriages . it would be murder because people are having a procedure made for intentionally killing their kids , so it would outlaw the medical procedure of an abortion . in the case where a baby were to die of a miscarriage , it would be deemed a death of natural causes , not manslaughter . manslaughter is for the unintentional death of someone through your own carelessness or recklessness . since a miscarriage is not due to one ’s own recklessness/carelessness the mother would not be charged . unless of course the miscarriage was due to the mother recklessness ( massive substance abuse/physical damage etc ) which would be considered manslaughter , and i ’m fine with that . because then it 'd sorta be his fault and would deserve to be charged with manslaughter . a pregnant woman ca n't do anything to physically kill her baby , it 's completely up to her body . i 'm pro-life , but i can see why a rape victim would obviously want an abortion ( especially after watching american horror story ) , and i 'd honestly say that they should be allowed in those cases because the woman would try to self-abort anyway . it 's a bit like the trolley problem ) , especially if the woman already has other children . actually i believe in most states you can be charged with murder or manslaughter for illegally killing a fetus . fatal accidents do n't always result in criminal charges though . well if you 're going to be consistent and say a fetus has the same moral status as a person then it does n't matter if they were conceived during a rape . i think very few pro-life people actually want to ban abortion when the mother 's life is at risk . it 's not considered immoral or illegal to decline put your life at substantial risk for another person . most are in favor the rape exception too even though it 's hypocritical . in general it 's hard to do something to only the fetus , though , and we have precedent for when the mother is involved in the manslaughter . miscarriages are typically due to things like hormonal imbalances that cause things like the implantation to fail . others have discussed what happens when somebody induces a miscarriage , but i would add that this would in fact be an abortion anyways . it would be the duty of the society and government to ease the mother 's immense suffering , though to an extent predictably short of abortion . many pro-life supporters believe that all abortions should be banned because they believe a fetus is a life . it is alive , for sure - the cells are clearly alive , dividing , growing , etc . this unknown life form is clearly not part of the mother per se - if you took a dna sample , do you find the mother 's dna or the dna of something else ? there may be criteria a scientist defines to separate states in the development of an unborn child , and in fact this dilemma is mirrored in questions that theologians have been asking for millennia about when a person gets their soul . in fact , both debates are made more difficult because there are not so many ' hard ' milestones in the development of an unborn human . conception , however , is probably the most dramatic milestone as we know for sure that in one moment you did not have the dna of a new lifeform , and in the next you do . if it is the case that a fetus is a human life , pro-lifers would not say that the comfort and well being off the mother is worth the intentional death of an innocent human being . in fact , i believe many other people would feel that way as well , if they accepted the premise that a fetus is a human . in reality it only speaks to the magnitude of importance of a human life that one would even consider requiring a rape victim to carry a baby to term . there may be treatments for which the rate of survival of the fetus is near zero . it is ultimately the doctor 's call on whether a treatment is abortive or merely difficult to survive . that women can fall into this predicament for no fault of their own clearly calls for continued support of research on obstetrics and other related fields to prevent these morally gray situations as much as possible . it is an adherence to the moral stance that the intentional taking of an innocent life ( abortion ) can not ever be a moral means to an end . both pro life and pro choice policies taken to their conclusions require many policies to be implemented that would not be clean and simple . overall you are probably right and i think thats ultimately why its legal . if a person killed a pregnant woman he can also be charged with the death of the baby . for point one , you ’re missing out on some important legal concepts . it is generally easily proven in court and is not what the prosecution spends the most time arguing . mens rea is the other concept , which means ( either literally or closely , i ’m not sure ) “ guilty mind ” . this is where a majority of court is argued because the prosecution must prove that the person on trial intended to do what they did . to violate a law , you must commit the act and have the level of intent named in the statute . for instance , manslaughter is not satisfied by active intent , because it would be homicide , but is satisfied by the concept of “ knowing ” ( which is to say , the person knew the act was dangerous and did it anyways , but did not intend to injure anyone ) . in the case of a miscarriage , a woman would not be guilty of manslaughter because she did n’t do anything on purpose . the only exception would be if maybe she did something to induce a miscarriage but that would be so difficult to prove in court that most prosecutors would n’t bother with it unless they had a slam-dunk case . you only get charged with manslaughter if it 's criminal negligence . some pro-lifers try to draw an exception for rape because a ) they make up so few of the abortions , and b ) it 's a more sensitive topic . but if you punish them by saying "" aha if you make an exception for rape , then it proves you 're wrong "" , that will lead people to reject allowing it in the case of rape . "" in a world where a fetus ' life is equivalent to a living person "" this admits a fetus has life , therefore is alive . if it was actually a miscarriage then there are a multitude of biological factors that are out of anyone 's control . same as if someone steps out in front of you and you hot then with your car , you would n't be changed with manslaughter ."
9vybr0,"the democratic party should actively seek to destroy the republican party . to be clear , when i say ' destroy ' i mean pass laws and restructure to disempower . i am not advocating violence . over the last ten years or so , i 've seen the republican party act , consistently , in bad faith . as a group , they never call out the actions of their own , they defend lies . and almost all of their time and energy is dedicated to shoring up their own power rather than governing . i could fill books with specific examples . but i 'll leave it there . i do have a few policies in mind , and i 'll list them below to give you an idea of what i 'm talking about . but keep in mind , i 'm not here to advocate for any specific policy . examples : 1 . vastly enlarge the house of representatives to make gerrymandering harder . 2 . grant statehood to dc and puerto rico , to enlarge available democratic electoral votes and aquire more senate seats . 3 . split california into 3 + states to fabricate yet more senate seats . < i have moved on this point . 4 . instantiate automatic voter registration and make a new voting rights act to restrict states from suppressive shenanigans . 5 . enlarge the supreme court , and pack it with liberals . or , alternatively , abolish judicial review . ( their ability to overturn laws . ) again though , not here for policy . the view i 'm submitting for review is this : "" should democrats gain the senate and presidency , they should use the machinery of power to dismantle republicans ' ability to achieve electoral victory . ""","rather than evaluating the merit of whether the republican party deserves this , let 's discuss what this would actually mean for our democracy . what you end up with is a political arms race from both sides to disenfranchise and dismantle the other . it 's not possible to dismantle the gop without allowing the gop to dismantle the democratic party given the opportunity . politicians generally like easy election victories no matter the party . and that 's assuming that all 3 californias would vote democrat ; the rural areas are fairly solidly republican , i think . and are you seriously suggesting that they remove one of the checks on executive and legislative power in order to pass laws you like easier ? there is nothing less democratic than making it impossible for a rival political party to win . imagine for a moment if the republican party , tomorrow , were to announce all the changes you just suggested , but to do so in their favor . the first thing they would do is expand the supreme court to make up 21 judges and trump and the republican had all the judges lined up . for every issue you have with the republican party , the democrats are doing similar things . you did n’t hear much pushback on it because years before the democrats took away the power of filibuster for all other judge nominations . the democrat position has consistently been to resist any efforts at improvements to the voting system , and particularly resistance to any efforts to require voter id , proof of citizenship , etc . yes , who can forget all the times that the republican party said "" if you like your healthcare plan you can keep it "" , or when they used the irs to target democratic fundraising groups , or when a democratic congress had to sue a republican president for spending money congress did n't appropriate ! funny i could have sworn someone around here used to say that dedicating time and energy to shoring up their own power rather than governing was a bad thing . the solution to an unfair system is n't to abuse the unfairness harder than your enemy can , it 's to make the system more fair . however , 2 attempts to abuse the already decrepit electoral college , while 5 opens up the possibility of manipulating the number of justices for partisan gain , a practice ended nearly 150 years ago . for 2 , i would suggest tossing the electoral college entirely , since the system is long overdue for a reform or replacement , and because democrats already lead the popular vote to a certain point . i think it is largely more important that we work to destroy the two party system . we need to offer more air time to third party candidates and level the playing field . to destroy one party is taking a huge step back and silencing the voices of thousands of americans . you have just made the largest gerrymandering move of all time making the democratic party the only one . puerto rico is not a state because it has not asked to become one . abolishing judicial review is not acceptable by one single iota . it is a protection from bad law and a check against corruption . as you can see most of your proposed policies are bad , or outright illegal . few republicans think the same thing in reverse . this is a systematic disadvantage for the democrat party , as honest democrats seeing this will consider leaving the party over it . are you sure you 're describing republicans here ? this sounds like a solid description of the democrat party ."
9vxher,"we are heading to a civil war/coup . cmv : the us is falling apart . in looking at history in general , it looks like the us is prime for some sort of dramatic gov ' t change , whether it be through civil war or some sort of coop within our current generation . when there are 2 primary idealogies within a nation that seem to be at odds with each other at every turn , the natural course is for them to separate and form 2 different entities or one quells the other through force . and since our 2 party system has drifted so far from center on both sides of the aisle and seemingly pushing even further to the left and right , it is just a matter of time before the rubber band snaps . there does n't seem to be any potential candidates that are campaigning on the idea of any tangible bipartisan cooperation and both parties do not seem worried about it . this is possibly the beginning of the end for america as we know it today .","maybe something horrible will happen some time down the line , but until trump ’s done with this term , potentially another one , and however long or short it takes to elect in a democrat for president , the military leans heavily conservative , and the vast majority of random civilians who support the freedom to carry serious weaponry are conservative . a civil war can only happen if the democrats somehow gain the sympathies of the military or if they become the party in power again and literally turn this country into a tyranny — both of which i think are highly unlikely in the near future . it ’s something that builds , something that can tear apart a country , something that ca n’t happen until enough people are willing to potentially kill their neighbor or attack a military installation over a dream of a better government . once it starts escalating to violence , it ’s extremely hard to stop , but until acts of violent protests and murder over political disagreements becomes the norm i wo n’t be too worried . cable media is dying due to the internet , so they have to have to make stories , usually out of nothing , and heavily embellish and exaggerate them . polarization is the best thing for these dying cable news channels , so they pounce on it . in the time of the american revolution and american civil war , people were living off the land , often growing their own crops or working for others , and generally speaking , were extremely fit and in shape . many countries have several cultures living together , sometimes leading up to a divide , but not going through with it . there is no simple seperation to form 2 countries , so it 'll never happen ."
9vxc2y,"the second amendment is an antiquated and useless , thus we should remove it and ensure a gun-free and more safer country . here 's my reasons why : ~ most european countries ( alongside canada and australia ) do n't have high gun deaths , simply due to either complete gun bans or strict gun laws . ~ most other countries do n't have to do ( sometimes realistic ) school shooter drills , like what we 've done since columbine ( and only increasing ) . ~ a lot of countries do n't have to have their kids desensitized by shootings . ~ cops wo n't freely shoot their own citizens without repercussions , and that we could just have peaceful police forces that would n't require guns just to function . ~ our second amendment was only used when we had no army to protect ourselves from the british . now , we literally have the largest and most powerful military in the world , thus making civilian use of guns useless . there 's simply no point to guns , and the arguments of sport and hobbying is just so minimal in importance in comparison to the importance of someone 's own life . guns only serve a purpose to hurt and kill by this point , and if other countries can survive without them , then so can we . wow , i was angry . to be honest , i really should 've known better and understood that things ca n't always go my way . i apologize for the arguments , guys .","and anyways being anti second amendment is not the same as being anti gun . therefore , the only way to remove it is by violating the constitution of the us . it should not be easy for evil / unstable people to aquire guns , but taking away a right from responsible people because irresponsible murderers killed people dooesnt solve the problem . in fact , what youre actually doing is taking the guns out of the hands of people who needed to defend themselves from said threat . most countries have their own conflict way far worse than school shootings . oh yeah not to mention if it was n't for the second amendment black people would be way too far off worse than what presumes on today . would n't get your first black churches , towns , the mass exodus to the west and mid-west post slavery labor if it was n't for the second amendment and the right for black people to defend themselves against any tyranny . for example , southern states during reconstruction tried to take guns out of the hands of newly freed slaves leaving them open to all manner of oppression and intimidation both institutional and societal . the first ten amendments of the constitution - the bill of rights - are held sacred above all others for a pretty good reason : repealing one sets the precedent ( which is something of extreme importance legally ) for repealing others . getting rid of the second amendment would be like opening pandora 's box ; i 'm pretty sure that you would agree with me when i say that creating the very real possibility of repealing the first amendment ( which guarantees free speech ) or the fifth ( the right to not self-incriminate ) would be disastrous . my country has some of the strictest gun laws in the world . the point of arming the citizens was to protect them from a tyrannical government . your assumption that the citizens are powerless against the government makes many poor assumptions . the military has a population of 1.4 million , including those in non combat rolls . even if 1 % of the population fought back were talking about more than double the size of the entire military hiding among the general population . c ) the military of 1.4 million could even maintain order against 327 million people in such a large area . that 's 1 person for every 2 square miles of the usa and 1 military member for every 300 people . hypothetically , let ’s say that ten years from now gun deaths have almost been eliminated from the country . let ’s say that in the next ten years we drastically increase our mental health treatment efforts , we end the war on drugs , we train our police officers to de-escalate dangerous situations , we enforce gun safety laws in an effective way , etc . one thing we do n’t do though is , we do n’t repeal the second amendment . but let ’s say hypothetically that ten years from now we average about ~ 50 gun deaths a year across the whole country . we have more active sport shooters in the largest swedish sport shooting organization , than there are active members in the swedish tennis organization . on top of that we have a good amount of hunters , so in total we have a fair amount of firearms for a european country . iirc , the last event we had that 's considered a mass shooting here was in 1994 , when a soldier opened fire with his service weapon and killed 7 people . while no western country have as many guns as the us , per capita , i can think of multiple countries that have a fair amount of guns , and that also have lower or similar homicide rates than the uk or australia . heck , even in the uk , the area that has the lowest homicide rate is northern ireland and that 's the part of the uk that retains much of their old gun laws and they can own handguns in larger calibers than .22 lr . in all the other countries i 've mentioned , we have better vacation laws ( i get 25 days by law in sweden + there are several paid public holidays +5 because my workplace is awesome ) , better employment protection instead of the at will you have in basically every state , cheaper higher education , cheaper health care that 's not the # 1 source for personal bankruptcy , and full time jobs actually provide a living wage . this is factually inaccurate . these countries had very low crime rates before such laws were even enacted , and these countries still experience gun violence . however , you see high crime in countries with a lot of poverty such as honduras or brazil . the amount of citizens the us has in poverty is higher than the population of some of those european countries . yes , there are controversial police shootings , but they are far from "" without repercussions "" . it 's not the sports shooters and hobbyists shooting people , it 's those with malicious intent . removing the guns does n't save lives if they were intent on taking them anyway . norway , australia , and france have all still had mass shootings despite tough gun laws . there is zero correlation between gun ownership rate and homicide/violent crime rate , whether between us states , between eu nations , or between the world as a whole : therefore there is zero factual basis for removing the rights of 100 million law abiding , non violent individuals who have committed no crimes . i do n't think this is correct , if you are arguing that removing guns from citizens leads to lower homicide rates . switzerland is probably the best example - guns are fairly easy to purchase , with some types of weapons not even requiring a license to obtain . i can find illegal drugs , stolen vehicles , trafficked people , and illegal guns in any city in the country . we need to stop focusing on the tools and start focusing on the people , society , and the culture ."
9vwwc4,"i believe that , in the grand scheme of things , donald trump is objectively a bad president that 's primary redeeming quality is that he characterizes/endorses a hate for "" the left "" , which causes nothing but tensions through the country . i am a citizen of america . i meet plenty of people who are n't in this country through my hobbies and every single time i tell them where i 'm from , the talk ( the majority of the time ) shifts from whatever we were talking about , to my president . from my point of view ( which is biased , as i 'm at least somewhat democrat even though i tend to stray towards the middle ) , without looking at the statistics of the situation the only thing differing trump from obama is that trump is much more blunt and extremely rude to nearly everyone he interacts with . i remember at the beginning of the presidency he was shaking the hand of a few world leaders and like ... yanked their arm towards him ? what would that even do ? what 's the goal ? again at a world leader conference there was a post on r/gifs where the man shoved another world leader out of the way to get to the front . i do n't get the hostility of him . one big point a lot of my republican friends make as to why they like trump is that he handles the economy a lot better as a business man . aside from that i thought the president did n't have much effect over the general economy , it seems to be pretty False as well . they said black unemployment was down , but that seems to be False . they also say that the stock market was up , but from what i remember just a few weeks/months ago dow jones fell substantially , and stock markets are historically bad to measure the health of an economy anyway . i have no reason to believe that donald j trump is a unique or good president , and no way to explain why certain groups of people obsess over him so much . the only notable difference between this presidency and the last is that i hear about this presidency a lot more , but that always seems to be over negative issues .","there is a fundamental misunderstanding that a lot of business people tend to have about the economy which is the idea that trade and transactions are a zero sum game . it 's like climate change , the overwhelming scientific consensus is that trump is wrong and his actions have hurt the economy , not to mention the harm to international relations done by making goods produced by our allies also subject to the tariffs . - negotiated far better deal than obama on nafta [ called usmca now ] on many issues obama conceded on during the trade talks [ you can google sources or i 'll fetch them later ] personally , i could n't care less what non-american citizens think about our president from trump to obama or any of the others ."
9vwp81,"i feel its odd to accept a trans women as a women when i would not accept a white person who identifes as black firstly , to any person who is transgender . i am not rejecting your humanity and free will . i would to your face and on here treat you with respect . my view is based on this story in the uk . -- url -- until i read this story i felt this man was just profiting of blackness . just as an american man recently used his 4 % african ancestry to gain some government help to set up a business . after reading his story is alot deeper than a quick buck . i read it as external factors have caused him to internalise the world 's view of him . now not speaking for everyone who changes gender . but i have heard it said that "" i do n't feel comfortable in this body "" or "" born in the wrong body "" is how some transgender people have felt ( correct if i 'm wrong here , i 'm sure they 're are plenty people who know alot about this than i do ) . however , the similarities i see is persons wanting to define their own identity . but if a white person takes on aspects of what they feel is black and starts to identify themselves this way i would tell them straight up it 's bull . and as a black male , an insult to my experience as a black man .","- some points of the article , my conclusion is the same as what the author has concluded , a free and open society should defer to an individual ’s self-identification , not shame her for embracing her agency and individuality . ... thus should there be a weighty presumption against so blocking people , against subordinating them by substituting our judgments about their identity for their own ..... this would seem to be a rather uncontroversial point , based on ordinary liberal arguments in favor of tolerance and respect for the dignity of others . - for example , transgender author and advocate meredith talusan , writing in the guardian , contends that the “ fundamental difference between dolezal ’s actions and trans people ’s is that her decision to identify as black was an active choice , whereas transgender people ’s decision to transition is almost always involuntary . ” - dolezal has been cast as a villain , a cynical appropriator of black culture , assumptive in her theft of something that does n’t truly belong to her .... for as kai m. green pointed out almost two years ago , “ these are the same arguments that people make regarding transgender bodies , ” that trans people are , for example , men trying to “ steal ” femininity and , with it , female victimhood . - critics of transracialism have similarly worried that the decision only works in one direction , white to black . - as is probably clear , tuvel ’s critics are impossible to pin down , because they work in reverse from a conclusion — transracialism is bad ! “ [ t ] he biology we know , ” says rymel , “ can not be ignored . ” this is a rather remarkable claim — just the kind of crude essentialist claim , in fact , to which trans advocates so often take exception . if you really think this guy is acting in good faith , then why would n't you agree he 's black ? gender is a touchier topic than other forms of identity because it ’s about what makes us who we are in a decisively physical way ; there are so many things at work in the human body that accounting for the precise cause of certain feelings and behaviors is impossible for the foreseeable future of scientific developments . in the face of a rapidly evolving social environment , it ’s become expected for the everyday person to take the brunt of this unknown with an equally vast tolerance for the possibility of these unknowns to be unchangeable aspects of other peoples ’ body-and-mind experiences , but it ’s hard to measure what ’s started in the head or started in the body , and where these resulting feelings fit in ongoing social constructs . a transgender woman is born a man , but has chosen to alter his physique to adopt a woman ’s form . in truth both mean a very similar thing ; women identify with aspects of femininity they find appealing as do men with masculinity , so it ’s conventionally easy to draw a line of equivalence between sex and gender . however , not being “ transgender ” means that people such as myself do n’t know what exact experience drew them to feel rejecting their sex-associated gender in favor of the opposing one . sex changes are not rational ( but also not condemnable ) because they involve reinforcing ideas the person in question is also rejecting on the opposite side of the fence . for example , a transgender woman rejects masculinity ’s association with their body , and so changes their body to align with the feminine gender-type characteristics . i might come back and edit this when i ’m better-rested i think that a key difference ( although certainly not the only one ) is that there are significant numbers of people , certainly in the millions , who are transgendered . there are not , however , similar millions of people clamoring to be treated as a clearly distinct race from the one they were sorted into at birth . if there were both millions of "" biologically black "" people who wanted to be treated as white , and millions of "" biologically white "" people who wanted to be treated as black ; then the entire idea would n't seem like so much of a joke . science has gathered some strong evidence that transgender people are n't "" choosing "" to define their identity , they 're born that way . there is no evidence that the example of the 4 % person has any brain structure that causes their racial identity , though i can see why you mentioned it . so , really these just are n't the same issue even though they may seem similar . doctors and scientists have studied transgender people and found facts supporting the acceptance of trans people - basically , their gender identity is real , and the best treatment for gender dysphoria is to accept them ."
9vvpen,"paid surrogacy should be legal , though regulated many countries , such as sweden , have banned even voluntary surrogacy for fear of allowing exploitation . their concern is that infertile couples are exploiting the poverty of surrogate mothers to make them go through the grueling process of pregnancy and childbirth . however , if the surrogate mother is well-informed about the risks of surrogacy , choosing to do so could be a rational and welfare increasing decision . if you have a severe lack of money , getting $ 20,000 dollars could more than outweigh the costs of pregnancy , and so prohibiting surrogacy leaves both infertile couples and potential surrogates worse off . thus all the government needs to do is to ensure potential surrogates are well-informed in making their decision .","this is bound to disproportionately affect poor women and their health , given the various health risks associated with pregnancy ( up to death ) : women from richer families on the other hand , have no need for putting their lives at risk in order to make some money off surrogacy . when a country bans something , they are n't saying "" it 's impossible for people to do it responsibly . "" surrogacy makes it even less likely for an orphan to find a good family . if the country is trying to increase adoption rates by families that can afford having a child , then it 's understandable to ban surrogacy for several decades , until the orphan rate declines significantly ."
9vu69z,"people with self-inflicted disabilities , such as obesity or lung cancer due to smoking , should be prohibited from using free healthcare . there 's not much to write about this one , it 's a very simple point , if you have caused your own illness/disability , you should not be allowed to participate in any free healthcare programme , such as the nhs , as it 's not the responsibility of others to pay for your mistakes . this also applies in many other aspects of life , not just healthcare , i believe that if you are obese , and you happen to take up two seats in an aeroplane , you should have to pay for two seats or not fly at all ( this applies for anyone who takes two seats up really , whether it be tall , weightlifters or whatever ) , or if you have attempted suicide , you or whoever willing to , should have to pay for the treatment from any injuries you sustained , not the public . feel free to ask questions if you do n't understand to what extent i 'm arguing this view , or if you need more information also i do n't think this applies for lots of countries , so you 'll just have to work with the concept , based on your personal beliefs .","this is like saying people who commit crimes should n't have access to public defenders . if healthcare is part of the infrastructure , then it 's part of the infrastructure and drawing lines on who can/can ' t use it , to what extent , and why is far too subjective and difficult to implement . if a smoker or obese person is paying into the system , then they should be able to get whatever they need out of it . there are a bunch of things that we all pay into that we do n't all use ( i.e. people who do n't have children yet have taxes that go towards public schools ) , but that 's kinda the point . you could just put some public health money toward promoting and subsidizing healthy behaviors , tax unhealthy behaviors , treat people when they get sick , and call it a day . so empathy aside , lets say you leave a type 2 diabetic person without care , you end up with a blind person who is in hospital getting gangrenous limbs removed . and you have to cover his emergency costs as we ca n't exactly let the guy die and his blindness/amputations are going to keep him from work so the taxpayer will end up having to support him - it 's going to cost the government a lot more money anyway than it would have been just to help him watch his diabetes from the start . this applies to things across the board by the way - preventative care tends to save money in the long run & it 's easy to imagine the economy does better when it 's inhabitants are healthy , fit to work & not all needing sick days . the nhs budget crisis started in 2013 , coincidentally at the same time as the conservatives 2012 health and social care act kicked in . we like to blame obese people and an aging population for the nhss current issues , but we had a budget surplus prior to 2013 and i 'm pretty sure the population has n't worsened that much since then . smokers at least pay more in tax than they cost the nhs . estimates state smokers bring in £ 12 billion in tax , and cost somewhere between £ 2 billion and £ 6 billion . but the nhs should be available to them if they 're making an effort to be better/healthier . there are people with self-inflicted health issues who can not afford to pay for them . do n't pick up the cost early , pick it up later , when their health issues are worse and much more expensive . do n't pick up the cost at all , just let them die . when the entire population is as healthy as possible , then things improve , both financially and socially . when you prohibit certain people from accessing healthcare , all you 're doing is making society worse . with the exception of genetic diseases and old age , almost all maladies are the result of some lifestyle choice . denying people medical coverage because their malady is the result of a lifestyle choice would result in denying everybody medical coverage for most of the medical problems they have . medical economic literature shows that obesity and smoking saves healthcare systems money by killing people earlier and more cheaply . smokers and the obese cheaper to care for , study shows -- url -- i think it 's ridiculous to continue to put all these stipulations on social welfare programs that will only perpetuate the inequality that got us in this situation in the first place . every time people want to introduce good legislation to address these problems , someone ( usually conservatives ) want to put all these stipulations on it so it can only be used by a portion of the population less likely to be affected by the issues that cause the problem in the first place . yes , i do think there is a personal responsibility element to it , but by refusing to help those people that may be addicted or live in a food desert without access or time to consume health foods you are only perpetuating the problem instead of actually trying to fix it . i think a middle ground here would be to include nicotine cessation programs in with healthcare bills and strongly encourage people to use them through incentives ( reduced deductibles or copays or something along those lines ) additionally , i think ensuring a healthy diet should actually be covered by healthcare costs or the food supplement program should be expanded , there is a strong link between the food we eat and the risks of being hospitalized , and it 's far cheaper to address the problem before they go to the hospital . literally all activity someone takes increases their chance of getting an injury , at what point do you go from ' this was unfortunate accident ' to ' this is your fault ' ? in most cases there is no way you can decide if an illness is due to lifestyle choices or other factors . what happens when someone who had high blood pressure and was n't treated because we determined ' it was their own fault ' gets a stroke ? do you say stroke was ' their own fault ' even though if the original condition was treated properly they probably would n't have a stroke ? if you do , you just wasted all the ' savings ' from not treating high blood pressure early - and possibly more if person is permanently disabled . the problem with not supplying nhs care to conditions that are ' self-inflicted ' is that you can , through no stretch of logic , define anything as self-inflicted . accidents are because you were n't being careful , liver damage because you drunk a non-zero amount of alcohol , lung damage from working in a smoky environment , diy accidents because you did n't pay for someone to do it for you . nhs is a universal healthcare service and to be universal , it needs to come without conditions . you 're initially intending to just cut off government services to the people who do n't live the way you think is upstanding , but you 're already creating irrational exceptions based on activities you appreciate , and based on your own arbitrary lines regarding what constitutes unsafe behaviour . you want an exception for sports , but who 's to define what constitutes "" legal "" sports , as you put it , or sufficient safety precautions ? ah , but recent studies have shown that heading the ball in football ( soccer ) produces low-level brain damage . a football fan might say it 's a worthwhile tradeoff , but a government bureaucrat responsible for health costs who does n't watch or play football might simply state that heading the ball is now no longer allowed if you want access to health care . science tells us that daily exercise is one of the best ways to ensure good health . the purpose of healthcare as a public service is to allow all of us to live life to the fullest without fear that an untreated injury will destroy us . a public healthcare system that makes moral judgments ends up putting us right back where we started : in fear of doing what we enjoy . if a person presents with lung cancer who is a nonsmoker , how are you going to weed out the cause to absolutely determine it was nothing they did or exposed themselves to willingly that caused the lung cancer ( like , choosing to live in a particular city that has a high pollution rate ? ) people in washington state have a higher chance of getting multiple sclerosis - does an ms patient get denied free healthcare if they live or lived in washington ? it was originally injured when i participated in martial arts , but when i had surgery it was discovered that the injury would n't have been possible if i did n't also have a hip deformation from birth . should i have qualified for free healthcare on the basis it was a hip deformation that caused the injury to be possible , or should i not have qualified under the reason that i chose to pursue ma ? part of the reason why people spiral into unhealthy behavior like overeating , smoking , and other addictions are coping mechanisms . these people may be struggling from mental health issues and you 'd effectively cut them off from seeking treatment . generally speaking there is a spectrum from , this is your fault , to this was outside your control , which makes it difficult to determine a cut off point . for example people who quit smoking before the age of 30 do n't statistically have a higher rate of lung cancer , and it 's not like after 30 you immediately get it , your more likely to have it if you have certain genes then if you smoke , and guess what some of those people that have the genes also smoke but die of heart disease caused by complication from them smoking . plus it 's difficult to determine what level of risk is acceptable , this person did street racing so we should n't pay if he got in an accident , this person drove a car so we should n't pay ( car are n't mandatory ) , this person got pregnant ... etc . lastly it 's usually not economically efficient for a country , we spent how much educating this guy , and he 's having a drug overdose , which statically he 'll stop using after a certain age and generate tax revenue to pay for his education , better let him die cause he ca n't pay now . we could know argue with this knowledge we could identify those at risk and give them warnings or support or education . all that said , i am do tend to agree with the mindset of this idea , i just think it is excessively difficult to implement in a way that would not be horribly abused ."
9vu3cn,"partial-birth abortion ban act is unconstitutional i always felt there is no legal basis for federal government to regulate abortion ( on non-federal property ) . that should be a state issue . i read through the constitution : -- url -- and nowhere does it say or implies that congress has the power to regulate abortion on the land administered by states . they tried to shoe horn this into interstate commerce . but this is patently ridiculous . if a women living in state a goes to a doctor in stat a to get an abortion , interstate-commerce is no affected in any way . i also read gonzales v. carhart . -- url -- but that case weirdly focused on vagueness ( of the term "" partial birth abortion "" ) and undue burden . those are not dispositive issues to me . the bigger problem is that the congress simply lacks the power to pass statutes like this . in fact , if there is vagueness , it 's in the phrase "" in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce , knowingly performs a partial-birth abortion .

9vpunb,"in the event of a shutdown of the us government , every member of congress should be fired and a new congress elected . article 1 of the us constitution gives congress the power over the budget . the antideficiency act states the government wo n't fund things it does n't have the money allocated for . so when congress fails to pass a budget , the government stops paying for things , likes its employees . and an odd quirk of the 27th amendment means that congress ( wo ) men continue to get paid . because congress cant change its pay , up or down , until after another session of congress . there 's been talk of a law to change this where congress stops getting paid , but i 'd argue this is n't enough . my key assumption is : 1 . a government shutdown is bad . really bad . i 'm actually open to being told this is an invalid assumption . i posit that : a ) i 'm under the impression that the government salary is n't what actually motivates most congressmen . the pay is nice , but not the real driver . it 's the power . b ) government shutdowns hurt the country , but not the people responsible for the shutdown . the incentives of the people in charge and the people being rules should align . c ) it is congress 's job to fund the government . and like any other job , if you suck at it , you should get fired . if i was writing a theoretical 28th amendment , i 'd say that in the event of a shutdown , all members of congress would be immediately removed and states would be responsible to find replacements as per their state laws . i would also make them ineligible for any future government office , elected or appointed . a softer version would allow them to finish their term before being replaced .","either it gives all the power to the governors of the various states to appoint replacements , or it will cost the states even more money to run another election . so a version of this is actually a feature of most parliamentary systems ( it 's called a "" loss of supply "" ) and usually means that there is no confidence in the prime minister and a snap election is held . the queen of england has the power to fire most elected officials throughout the common wealth . maybe the supreme court or a new branch of government , or frankly , the queen . we already have a mechanism to fire members of congress if we feel they are to blame for a problematic shutdown when you immediately remove those responsible for funding the government , the government will remain shut down for a longer period of time . elections take a long time to plan and fund , and that is more time that the country will suffer from the shutdown . an alternative to this would be just including congress in the group that is not salaried during the shutdown , giving them an incentive to not let shut downs happen ."
9vohru,"i 'm a pacifist . background : i define violence as behavior involving physical force intended to hurt , damage , or kill someone . i believe morality is relative , so violence is n't wrong for everyone . it 's just dependent on personal goals/beliefs . i reject the notion of forms of pacifism that involve selective violence , but for the sake of clarity i 'm against any form of violence under any circumstances i.e. an absolute pacifist . reasoning : violence is counter intuitive to one of my personal goals of peace defined as perpetual bodily freedom from reprisal . in recorded history it has failed to achieve this goal and while violence can certainly ( but not reliably ) immediately quell dissent , disobedience , etc , it also sets a precedent that violence is a tenable option in the long term . long term effects of violence are evident in a multitude of historical events e.g arms races as a result of new weaponry yielding major casualties , arms races as a result of a toppled world power leaving an empty spot , dictatorial regimes perpetuated out fear that they 'll end up being invaded like similar regimes have been , etc . violence , specifically killing , is counter intuitive to one of my personal beliefs that all human life is invaluable . one life is equivalent to all life , so killing in the name of the many of the few is n't justified . & #x200b ;","i 'm sure there have been pacifist peoples and cultures throughout history , but the only cultures around today are the ones willing to go to war . violence can be invited into any situation by a single person . and , once introduced , there are scant few methods of stopping a violent person that do n't involve violence . and , more often than not , is met with violent reprisal . violence does n't have to take the form of physically attacking someone , or even the threat of physical attack , and the idea that it does is a strike against any moral framework that includes it . violence is a bad solution for many situations , for the exact reason you give , that human lives are important , but it is n't inherently wrong - someone 's not wrong for using violence , they 're wrong because the end goal ( s ) behind their violence is bad . being unwilling to resort to violence enables those that are willing - you eventually reach a point where you have to physically prevent someone from inflicting further harm on the undeserving . uncompromising pacifism stems from the lack of a moral compass that would determine when violence is necessary , and a desire to "" take the high road "" and hope for the best rather than actually be seen making a judgement and risk being wrong . i wonder if situations exist where pacifism results in less peace then violence . it such situations do exist then is pacifism a bad strategy for achieving peace . i think its reasonable to say a serial killer can only be stopped with violence . violence to stop a serial killer , and perhaps violence to stop crime in general , then actually leads to more peace then pacifism does . so imo , if you goal is peace ( an admirable goal ) pacifism is a bad strategy . i do n't disagree with you in any axiomatic way but i have n't lived as a True pacifist . suppose someone that you could stop with violence is killing someone or kidnaping your child , is n't it right to defend the weak ? i have never been able to answer in a pacifist way that satisfied my sense of duty to those around me . you have the pleasure of being pacifist because someone else is having the displeasure of being violent for you . without those non-pacifists , you would be a target , then eventually a victim . in any situation where you choose pacifism , they will always win . if you have the opportunity to stop a violent/evil act , but choose not to , then that 's still an "" active "" decision ."
9vnytm,"blockchain would provide a viable alternative to voter id without requiring additional effort from voters . first and foremost , i 'm not talking about mobile or online voting that would unnecessarily open up individuals as points of attack . that 's what i keep seeing tons of articles about . voting would still be done in person and voter registration would still happen the same as before , it would just be the back end using blockchain so that the results and counts were distributed , public , and anonymous . second , while i 'm probably more familiar with blockchain technology than the average uninterested person , i am by no means an expert and i 'm probably making wrong assumptions or working on faulty understandings about the capabilities and limitations of the technology . please correct me on those if it seems like i am . i always want to have deeper understandings of things . with those said , what i 'm envisioning is when you register to vote you are either assigned your keys on the spot and instructed to protect them or ( if possible ) you are given seeds which can be used in conjunction with a time based seed to generate the keys when you sign in at your polling place . once you have your wallet , a voting official will transfer your voting coin to said wallet , creating a verifiable transaction on the ledger from their personal official wallet to yours . in the voting booth , you cast your votes as you wish using your coin . then through whatever distributed processing technology/methodology makes the most sense , aka blockchain magic , the public ledger is updated with your anonymous vote . once completed , the voting machine would print out the public ledger entry corresponding with your vote so that each voter can verify that their vote was correct and counted . dealing with incorrectly recorded votes is where my knowledge of the technology comes up short and there is most likely better solutions than i can come up with . my thinking is that selected officials at every polling location will be given wallets with a special "" correction coin "" separate from the voting "" coin "" that they can send to the voters wallet . with that correction coin , the voter will be able to tell a machine the corrections they want to make and the machine will be able to cast a -1 vote for the incorrect submission and a +1 for the correct one . this way there is full transparency of which official approved every change made , and in the event of any funny business the auditors ( or watchdogs or 4chan dudes with way too much time on their hands ) can very easily track down the public key of whomever was responsible . from my admittedly incomplete knowledge of blockchain it seems to me that this reduces the points of failure down to basically the same or better than paper ballots . phishing people 's keys would be pointless because they would be able to correct the fake vote in person and a phisher would n't be able to change a genuine vote after the fact without traceable official permission . extra/fake registrations could be thwarted by having officials do a physical in-person count of total votes that would utilize appropriate counting and validation techniques . if the physical count does n't match the ledger count , an audit is triggered to figure out why . if hackers managed to get into voting systems , they would still need private keys of both officials and voters in order to do anything . then anything they did manage to do would be publicly visible on the ledger and presumably suspicious looking enough to trigger an audit . there are a few potential points of failure i can see that i might not have a great solution for but they seem like someone smarter than me could come up with something . one is verifying identity and eligibility prior to registering to vote . this obviously runs into some of the same social hurdles as voter id . i 'm tempted to suggest using ssn and verifying the name somehow in order to register ( whether that 's id , birth certificate , mail with name and address , whatever it may be ) , but at the same time i very much dislike the concept of using ssn as a form of identification as it 's a terrible system for that purpose . another potential point of failure i foresee is voters losing their private keys or seeds and being unable to vote . on this one i 'm tempted to say tough titties . that 's the response people who do n't register in time get . that 's the response people who do n't go to the correct polling location get . we already require certain levels of responsibility from voters and i 'm inclined to think keeping track of their private key is reasonable to be lumped in with that . so , after all of that , what gaping security threats or egregious constitutional rights violations am i missing here ? what is it about blockchain that makes it not a viable basis for secure vote counting ? some people have pointed out that if photo id is not required at some point in the process , there 's nothing stopping me from obtaining your keys/seeds and voting as you with that information . for that reason , i have definitely changed my view on using blockchain as a substitute for voter id . i do still think it offers at least some additional security , solely due to the fact that keys/seeds would be more difficult for someone to obtain than the current information used as verification that is frequently easy to find with a few google searches . i also still think it would offer additional security and transparency for the counting process and i would still support a more official and thorough proposal for it . people have also pointed out the possibility for and troubles with the ability to verify one 's vote . i think just like the current measures in this regard there are ways we could come up with to get around that . my initial idea was to use the printout to verify your vote while still at the polling place and once you are satisfied that your vote has been cast and counted correctly you give it to officials on the way out . this giving the added benefit of assisting in the in-person count used as verification at the end of the night .",""" public ledger entry "" does n't work because it would allow you to prove to yourself that your vote was registered to the right candidate ( yay ! ) but it would also allow you to prove to the person paying you or blackmailing you that you voted as instructed ( critical problem ) . there are many parts of the current voting system designed to prevent something just like this ( no cameras in the voting area , only one person at a time , etc . ) if you can verify that your vote went a particular way from a public ledger , then it 's not an anonymous vote . ( suppose someone said they 'd shoot you unless you voted from trump and then pointed out the vote on the ledger . ) basically , votes are either verifiable , or they 're anonymous , but you ca n't have both . what 's to stop corporations ( or even wealthy individuals ) from buying the tokens from large populations of poor people for an amount that , while trivial to the buyer , it makes no economic sense for the seller to refuse ? this turns voting into a luxury for those that can afford not to sell their vote or even buy multiple votes rather than an intrinsic right , and the end result is that elected officials only need to represent vote-buyers , not vote-sellers . the problem with block chain is that it does n't eliminate trust at the point of data entry . memorizing or keeping track of a secure key that you use once a year or less is a much bigger hurtle than keeping track of an id . plus the state would have to know to invalidate they keys of people who move or die or when someone forgets their key , this would mean that your keys are not anonymous making it easy to track who is voting for what . if we are only securing voters based on who has this key , what 's to stop my from taking your key and voting in your stead ? blockchain works best when there is no central authority that everyone can trust . but you ’re plan still relies on a central trusted authority , so that negates most is the benefits of blockchain . if you can trust a central election authority to hand out voting tokens , why ca n’t that same central authority be trusted to count them ?"
9vjznq,"shorter women are more feminine in this view i rely on the following : \ - primary and secondary sexual characteristics ( ssc from now on ) are what define "" femininity "" and "" masculinity "" biologically speaking \ - for women common sscs are larger breasts , widening of hips , lower waist to hip ratio , changed distribution in weight and fat , smaller frame , with smaller bones and less muscle mass compared to an adult male \ - if a certain ssc is more pronounced in a person , that person can be more easily identified as belonging to their sex by others \ - e.g. if the above is True , a 5 ' 0 woman with wide hips ( female sscs ) would look more feminine than a 6 ' 3 "" woman with broad arms and a beard ( male sscs ) , \ - if the above statements are True , shorter women look more feminine than tall women if all other things are equal & #x200b ; please note i 'm not advocating for feminie = attractive . i 'm also leaving the social aspect of gender such as behaviors , stereotypes and roles generally associated with gender out of this discussion . please leave politics out of this , thank you .","many past and present cultures have woman wearinf shoes specfic to making them look taller . ssc occur during and after puberty ( breasts , hips size , hair growing ) . height only quickly increases during puberty as girls have growth spurts as well ( though often smaller ones than males ) . a ssc cannont be something that it would be more ideal if you did n’t go through puberty ( as staying prepubescent means being of a smaller height ) . i agree with you about the existence of "" femininity "" and "" masculinity "" and i like the way you define them . being 5 ' 2 "" is not more feminine then 5 ' 4 "" , because 5 ' 4 "" is the most typical feminine height . you could compare a taller woman with more feminine sscs and a shorter woman with more masculine sscs to get a different result . do you also believe by this logic that very short hair and thus baldness is more feminine since male hair grows longer , do you also believe that a comically unnaturally high speaking voice is more feminine ? i agree the second women is less traditionally feminine , but its impossible to say its because of the hieght - you 've given her several traditionally unfeminine characteristics , and its impossible to judge what is more starkingly unfeminine . also , if height were unfeminine , why would wearing high heels be considered a traditionally feminine practice for women to partake in ? if you took a short woman and scaled them up proportionally ( or a tall woman down ) , there would be no change . it seems that it 's purely the "" broad arms and a beard "" part , that makes those woman less feminine , rather than the height ? but would you agree that the majority views femininity as more attractive , and that features considered attractive must therefore be more feminine ? femininity however is n't just about appearance , it 's also about behavior . and short women are n't necessarily more feminine in behavior . i agree that the convention of the big and strong man protecting his shorter and more delicate woman is most likely a popular trend , and has been so for some time . however i ca n't say how popular it is , and i have a feeling that this trend is slowing down in these modern times , where women can take care of themselves and men are starting to be "" allowed "" to be feminine . i would say that 5 ' 0 woman with broad arms , narrow hips and a beard would look exactly as unfeminine as 6 ' 3 woman with broad arms , narrow hips and a beard . well , you 've included "" smaller frame "" as being part of the definition of ' feminine ' you 're using , so from then on it 's a kind of tautology to say shorter women are more feminine . the issue is just whether this is a reasonable definition of femininity/a coherent concept , and why you 've selected the traits you did as being feminine ."
9vh068,"voting should not be a right that every citizen enjoys . i do n't think that every citizen should be allowed to vote . according to a recent study conducted by the university of pennsylvania 's annenberg public policy center ( 2017 ) , only 26 % of americans could name all three branches of government , 37 % could not name one right guaranteed under the first amendment , and of the remaining 63 % only 3 % could identify their right to petition the government . tony blair once stated “ the single hardest thing for a practicing politician to understand is that most people , most of the time , do n’t give politics a first thought all day long . or if they do , it is with a sigh ” . today , political parties are looked at more like sports teams with voters choosing to vote for those who may be the most boisterous , or who hits the other side the hardest . when , in actuality , this does nothing but soe division among the country and leads to real societal issues not being addressed in a reasonable fashion . my great grandma lives in a nursing home and has dementia , and the staff took all of the residents who wanted to vote out and let them vote . why would we let uninformed individuals help to decide the future of the country ??","the same people that decide the test are the very people that have a vested interest in choosing who votes for them . we already see this with gerrymandering being used to scientific precision to increase election chances , what makes you think tests like these would n't be used in the same way to disenfranchise voting blocks that politicians do n't like ? the idea that the government should have any hand in who gets to vote sounds good on paper but has been shown to have extremely negative effects in literally every example in history . not only that , but is n't the idea of someone who "" should n't "" be allowed to vote entirely subjective ? not only this , but even if someone is n't informed about their government they are still nonetheless subject to it , and should therefore have a say in how they are governed . instead of barring people from voting ( which comes with its own problems ) why not work to educate people on how the united states government ( or whatever sovereignty your apart of ) works ? this way you kill two birds with one stone : you do n't bar people from voting and you educate your populace . there is no viable way to qualify people to vote without unintentionally suppressing a population of potential voters that should vote . creating a process to qualify people to vote would be what 's happening now , but out in the open . the cost of creating and implementing a process for qualifying people to vote is most likely more expensive than just subsidizing the internet . if you believe that a government administered test will only be targeted at "" uninformed individuals , "" can i ask what your analysis of the literacy tests before the civil rights enacted voting legislation ?

voting is not about smart people deciding how to run the country . we have a representative democracy , not a direct democracy ; the people we elect to represent us are ( theoretically ) the smart people who decide how to run the country . voting is about the citizenry expressing their preferences about what they want those representatives to accomplish during their time in office , by selecting representatives who promise to accomplish the things you want ( by whatever mysterious smart-people methods are needed ) . someone does n't need to know the 3 branches of government in order to know that they ca n't survive on a minimum wage job , or to know that they think abortion is murder , or to know that they are against racial profiling or against illegal immigration . they can accurately express these preferences through voting regardless of how informed or educated they are , and the elected representatives will figure out how to implement them . to argue that those peopleshould n't vote is to argue that their preferences should not be represented in our public policies ."
9vgsja,"the squandering and/or hoarding of wealth is immoral . i 'm writing a paper on the moral and immoral use of wealth for my philosophy class , and i 'm having some trouble thinking up some well thought our counter-arguments . outside of my primary intent with this post , i 'm fully up for discussion over this topic , and am not one to turn down conclusive evidence that is contrary to my views , and would rather encounter converse opinions to either strengthen or adjust my views . here is an excerpt from my paper , explaining the basic ins and outs of my argument . i 'll be responding to any responses as soon and as reasonably as i can . \ - "" morality can be defined as those actions and creeds that benefit one ’s self and/or society , and those actions and creeds that attribute themselves to the decay and/or detriment of one ’s self and/or society , as immoral . humans are a social species by nature , and the greatest invention of mankind is that of our collective and individual societies , which raise us beyond hume ’s feudal laws of nature . the benefit of society , should be the second highest priority amongst all those that participate in it , only trumped by acts of self-preservation and meeting one ’s own physical , mental , and emotional needs . this paper will follow within a loose interpretation of the philosophical doctrine of utilitarianism , a sort of middle ground stance between that of ethical altruism and ayn rand ’s ethical egoism , though it will tend to sway towards rand ’s egoism , only in-so-far that the needs of the self takes some amount of priority over the needs of society , but only in-so-far as the benefit of the self does not in any significant way contribute to the detriment society . the self must be able to achieve a base level of happiness and productivity in order to maximize their own ability to contribute towards the benefit of society . henceforth , any actions that would contribute towards the benefit of one ’s self or society more than any detriment that it would also incur upon one or the other , shall be considered moral . similarly , any action that would more greatly come to the detriment of the self or society than either would benefit , or that would come into direct opposition to the benefit of either , shall be considered immoral . property , as a concept , are all physical possessions and currency owned by an individual or an association of an individual ( e.g. , companies , corporations , and foundations ) . wealth shall be considered a subsection of property , referring only to the currency one owns . extreme wealth can be defined as an individual ’s or an association of an individual ’s accumulation and hoarding of wealth that can be quantified as vastly overreaching its needs , and is , in most cases , liquid assets ( i.e. , currency ) that are easily moved and exchanged . a study published in the journal nature human behavior states that the “ emotional well-being ” of an individual is achieved once they have an income of $ 60,000 - $ 75,000 a year ( jebb et . al. ) . income that exceeds this amount does little to increase the happiness of individuals and provides little to no increase in their quality of life . money can buy happiness when that wealth is used to pay for basic goods and services such as food , healthcare , and housing . once individuals no longer worry about their basic needs being met , the additional accumulation of wealth contributes little to their individual overall happiness . with these definitions set , any accumulation of wealth beyond the point of maximum personal gratification would be squandered if used to further this pursuit , and the hoarding of wealth prevents it from being used to benefit anyone . wealth is meant to be used , in one way or another , to increase the total happiness , productivity , or security of an individual or the society in which they are a part of . any wealth that is hoarded ( i.e. , stashed away with no intent of use ) , is prevented from being used for its purpose in society , and is an act against the good of society , for , if wealth exists , and it is unable to contribute to the benefit of one ’s self , then the only moral use of said wealth is towards the benefit of others . thus , the squandering or hoarding of wealth , by the definitions set , is immoral . "" \ - & #x200b ;","i blow another 50 million on cars , clothes , and useless things . if i leave it there , i will lose about between 18 and 27 million dollars a year . that means i would lose my $ 900 million fortune in as little as 33 years . if i make 9 % investing , once we subtract the 2-3 % inflation , that means i make around $ 50 million a year instead of losing $ 33 million each year . i do n't have any innovative ideas to improve society . but elon musk does . he says that if i give him money , he will create a better type of car . the car is electric meaning we no longer need to rely on oil . furthermore , the time humans save by not having to drive means we can spend that time writing poetry , developing software , or innovating in other ways . being wealthy benefits you so would n't it be moral . private jet 's cost much more than $ 75,000 but they vastly increase the quality of life of whoever owns them . every few years a new study comes out with a new figure at which you ca n't gain more happiness past . but that does n't change the fact that there a parts of this country where you have to make double your given sum to be considered middle class . if you spend the money , then another person has it . you are looking at the half of the economy that deals with consumption and completely ignoring production . if you assume that our economy functions as a matter of course and that we can change whatever with no consequence , then your point is reasonable . the problem is that wealth inequality and "" hoarding "" is an integral part to our economy 's ability to function . our market system attempts to achieve maximum productive efficiency in economic output . returns can be thought of as the degree to which the public value goods and services divided by the amount of resources it took to achieve that end . those who produce a lot efficiently see higher returns on their capital than those who produce less using more resources . over time , this causes capital to flow from capitalists who are bad at resource allocation to those who are skilled at it and make good decisions . warren buffet has been extremely successful in identifying people and organizations that are effective at providing goods and services to the populace in high proportion to the amount of resources they use in doing so . the market ( which is always pushing for efficient production ) takes capital away from those who are ineffective at this and gives it to him , because he can be trusted to use it wisely . by constantly concentrating capital in the hands of those most effective at using it to achieve economic output , the system maximizes the degree to which the economic demands of the populace can be satisfied . the system rewards people who accumulate capital , then use it to provide goods and services for the public rather than personal consumption . city high-rises are filled with people who make huge salaries but spend the money as fast as it comes in . money runs through their hands and they use it on short-sighted , personal consumption . capital has to concentrate or it can not be put towards meaningful economic improvements . good luck finding 100,000 regular people who are willing to chip in $ 1,000 to build a new factory which they will all own and manage collectively ; and if that does happen , good luck repeating it enough times to run the whole economy . free markets are extremely good at creating structures that produce goods and services which the public value . the problem is that the most effective way to accomplish that is to find the minority of people who are extremely good at allocating capital and give them basically everything , which is what the market does , and this leads to inequality . this is a conflict about how quickly our economy grows in productive capacity vs. how much inequality we are willing to tolerate as a society . ' hoarding of wealth ' in economic terms means just saving and is possibly the single most important factor which enables an economic growth ; it can also be described as a process of delayed gratification - just like you have to abstain from current consumption of grains to leave some of it for future sowing , leaving some money ' unused ' enables the production of capital goods which eventually make all manufactured goods cheaper and more abundant . i think the reason that we may intuitively feel that possessing wealth is immoral is because - i believe - historically , a lot of it were accumulated by immoral means . a slave owner , a landlord , all ' nobility ' etc. were rich because they were stealing and abusing people left and right - to hell with them . currently , modern industrialists are still using government 's power for heavily rigging the game in their favor by restricting competition by ' legal ' means - i am not a fan of them either , but their wealth hoarding is n't the problem per se . and we figure out that companies that are highly competitive actually want to help everyone so the person in charge is not hoarding money but also not living a normal life . using this formula we can calculate monopolies to be high scoring and competitive companies to be low scoring . because of no competition it does n't need to spend any $ on r&d and market share is high so it 's score is high . competitive companies have to spend white a bit of $ on r&d and market share is n't high so they get a low score . but being poor and saving your money also requires conservative spending , penny pinching , and essentially ' hoarding ' your money so that it is n't all gone . there is n't much difference , aside from the fact that hoarding larger assets poses much higher risk . if you save 3,000 dollars and leave it in a bank , there is n't much chance that you wo n't be able to access that cash in ten year 's time . if you buy real estate , or an airplane , or a few businesses , those things can all drop in value by half , or worse , become obsolete or bankrupt in even less time , without careful management and diligence on the part of the ownership . almost all businesses run on some sort of leverage ( if you do n't know what that word means , look it up ) which runs the risk of bankruptcy , which is very common ( our president has filed chapter 11 a number of times ) but nobody becomes famous for bankruptcy , so we do n't hear about it like we do about successful businesses . to say that wealth gathering is immoral overlooks the fact that it is necessary . a small change in demand , say from students , could run a venture like that from black to red ) . someone has to distribute expensive goods like watches , raw materials , financial securities and annuities , all lf which are subject to changes in value and require expertise to acquire or manage . most percieved immortality tied to wealth comes from the fact that wealth usually accompanies power , which , under late socio-political schools of thought that place egalitarianism and equity above all else , can appear to give rise to conflicts of morality . a boss , world leader , ceo , shareholder , aristocrat , royalty , or otherwise institutionalised gatekeeper can and does decide , to some degree , the fate of other people 's lives in a way that is determinate of their success . money is only tangently related , but you 'll find that ' wealth hoarding ' bears little immoral consequence in and of itself , and in fact does n't change a person 's situation that much aside from nominally having more or less money , assets , and liabilities . - i had a step brother who hoarded money but it was a mental disorder in my opinion . money is stored in banks , which loan out money to people for things like starting a business . the wealth owned by wealthy people does indeed work toward the benefit of others , even if they do n't actively use it for that purpose . wealthy people get wealthy in almost all cases by giving employment to other people . bill gates owns one of the biggest and most successful companies in the world . if he had squandered his money throughout his life and only kept $ 50k - $ 60k per year for optimal happiness , there would be 131 thousand people without jobs . the highest-paid people are paid a lot because of their benefit to society . doctors make a lot of money because their skills are valuable and help people . business owners employ people and provide products that enrich our lives . scientists explore new avenues of of the natural world to help our planet and discover new things about it . you say that "" the benefit of society , should be the second highest priority "" after the individual . the study is n't linked but i infer this is some sort of average , does this mean that every single individual 's "" emotional well-being "" is achieved at this income range ? the thing i see being missed here is that wealth is used to generate economic growth in the form of investment . i think there is a common misconception that rich people are like scruge mcduck sitting on a pile of cash ( aka hoarding ) . they have their wealth invested in one form or another . banks loan out money to business , often times small businesses . they also make home loans and auto loans . they are required to keep a percentage of cash on hand , and the excess is loaned out or used in other ways . i could not get a loan for my business from my bank if a scruge mcduck did not have a shitload of money there . anyone that has ever gotten a loan in order to improve their lives has benefited from someone else 's wealth . otherwise we 'd be cutting down trees and building with our bare hands . money has multiple purposes in society , focusing on its consumption purpose only ignores the rest . you do have a good point about the way money loses its ability to make us happy as you accumulate more . if you qualify for a 1.9 % auto loan on a 20,000 car , you are using someone else 's $ 20,000 to make your purchase and only paying them a 1.9 % annual fee ."
9vgbkp,"reddit ’s algorithm that prevents people that have been downvoted from commenting inhibits alternative viewpoints and should be abolished . an example : we all know / r/politics is filled with liberal bias . i believe one of the reasons it is so overwhelmingly bias is because people with alternative views are highly downvoted . that ’s all well and good , but the conversation can not continue because reddit limits those who are downvoted to commenting only once ever 8 minutes . this limit prevents legitimate discussions from occurring in subreddits that claim they invite legitimate discussion . it ’s one thing if the subreddit does not invite discussion . but if they do this limit should not exist . it should be abolished . change my view .","a lot of times , when a specific rule or feature is implemented , it 's never going to be a perfect fix for a particular problem . a lot of those downvoted comments are just low quality comments that the people are spamming . for instance , in politics , i often see spam of the "" lol cnn is the source lolllll !! "" you rarely see a controversial comment that is presenting an intellectually honest argument . sure , it happens , but the wide majority of the downvoted posts are trolls . just sort any politics thread by controversial and you will immediately see what i mean . the downvoted posts are n't well thought-out arguments . very often , they are low effort junk posts or they are extremely intellectually dishonest or manipulative . for instance , someone posting that edited video of acosta would be an example of the kind of manipulative spamming i am referring to . what alternative way can you think of where trolls can be contained without having hundreds of mods constantly cleaning up threads ? by "" hiding "" downvoted comments we essentially limit the number of downvotes you can receive on a per-comment basis ( because how many people are really going to open a hidden comment just to downvote it ? which means that you can easily participate in a sub like politics as long as not all of your comments are being downvoted . it seems to me that the two groups being caught by this ban are 1 ) trolls and 2 ) people making low effort comments that do n't add all that much to the discussion . "" bias "" does not mean "" the majority of people in this community support a particular ideology "" . "" bias "" means that whoever is in control of some media outlet or community is intentionally altering content such that it favors a particular ideology ( generally because they would benefit from misinforming other people ) . in the case of something like / r/politics , the people in that community upvoting or downvoting comments is an application of free speech . it is not bias if pro-conservative posts tend to get downvoted more just because the community disagrees with them . for example , if you ask professional scientists whether evolution is a better theory than creationism , they will unanimously support evolution . the issue i think you are seeing is that legitimate arguments actually tend to favor a liberal ideology . as someone who does not believe in this ideology , it feels like a bias when all of your arguments get shut down . it 's not because of a bias , it 's just because conservative arguments tend to be pretty bad and break down quickly under scrutiny . downvotes are meant to be used on comments that do n't contribute to the conversation . not seeing comments that do n't contribute helps people focus on actual discussion . the purpose of reddit has never been to foster unbiased discussion . i 'm not even sure what that would look like , but regardless : reddit 's upvote and downvote system is a form of outsourcing moderation to the community at large . therefore , it can not be unintentional that one of the side effects is that the community will highlight posts that generally agree with them and obscure posts that generally do not , that 's the whole point . if anything , subreddits that attempt to foster unbiased discussion are the misguided ones , and ( in some cases ) , i 'd argue that they only exist to give the impression of unbiased discussion to hide the bias ."

9vf11w,"christians should advocate for stricter gun laws after hearing the news about the thousand oaks shooting , i started thinking about gun laws , as you do . i found it weird that there is a heavy overlap between christians and people who oppose gun control . as someone who 's grown up in the church , i could n't see two more opposing ideals . so i wanted to present my arguments to see if there was something i was missing . i hope they make sense ! i think it 's important to tell you that i 'm not american . i understand this is a pretty heated debate but since i 'm not really a part of it , i might be missing some important parts of gun laws . just bear that in mind if i come across as ignorant . \ ------------------------------- i 'll split up my argument into three parts : 1 . jesus ' message of pacifism and love 2 . christian trolley problem ? 3 . no verses advocating for weapons other than exodus 22:2 ( 1 ) if jesus was living today , he would not own a gun . his message was about spreading love for one another , which is directly contradictory to what a gun represents . even if a gun was just for protection or a way to scare off potential offenders , the threat of its use directly contradicts his teachings of turning the other cheek ( [ matthew 5:38-40 ] ( -- url -- +5:38-40 & version = niv ) ) . on top of that , when jesus was being arrested , he tells peter to put away his sword saying , "" all who draw the sword will die by the sword "" ( [ matthew 26:52 ] ( -- url -- +26:52 & version = niv ) ) . i mean you could just replace "" sword "" with "" gun "" and you 'll see that jesus was clearly against the use of weapons . & #x200b ; ( 2 ) this one 's something that i used to think about when i was younger and i feel like it applies here . it does n't really have any biblical groundings or anything , just me overthinking . the idea is that a christian should always put the lives of non-christians over their own . since christians are saved , they should n't have anything to fear through death while non-christians still have n't been saved and might have the chance to meet god if they lived longer . how this applies to guns is that a christian should never use lethal force ( excluding for war purposes and whatnot since there are plenty of examples of war killings in the bible ) . the whole point of a gun is the threat of lethal force . if christians have no use of lethal force , why should they ever need a gun ? maybe this argument is a bit meh , but i 'll put it in here anyway . & #x200b ; ( 3 ) so i ca n't really find any verse that can in anyway be used to contradict jesus ' teachings . the biggest advocate for guns in the bible that i could find ( and one that i 've heard brought up in this topic before ) is this one verse [ exodus 22:2 ] ( -- url -- +22:2 & version = niv ) that says , "" if a thief is caught breaking in at night and is struck a fatal blow , the defender is not guilty of bloodshed "" . so yea , at face value , it looks like the bible is saying that if someone tries to rob you , you are within your right to stop them , even if that leads to death . but the very next verse says that , "" if it happens after sunrise , the defender is guilty of bloodshed . "" so it does n't seem to be that the bible is giving you the right to lethally defend yourself , otherwise it would n't matter the time . i think that the bible is just giving a law that protects people who accidentally , in the act of self defense , kill someone with zero intent to kill . so even , this verse does n't really give us a good biblical reason against gun control , which a christian would need to disregard jesus ' predominantly pacifistic teachings . \ ------------------------------- so yea that 's the argument . change my mind !","when a strong man , fully armed , guards his own palace , his goods are safe ; luke 11:21 who were building on the wall . those who carried burdens were loaded in such a way that each labored on the work with one hand and held his weapon with the other . and each of the builders had his sword strapped at his side while he built . so moses spoke to the people , saying , “ arm men from among you for the war , that they may go against midian to execute the lord 's vengeance on midian . i could offer more scripture references but it would quickly turn into a wall of text . jesus was decidedly not against his disciples arming themselves and i think you are taking his “ die by the sword ” out of context as the disciples would have been outmatched by trained roman soldiers . i do n’t really want to argue about the rest of your points right now , but i ’d like to add that jesus ’s message was not ‘ peace and love ’ , ( though love was certainly a part of it ) it was ‘ i ’m god and i ’m here to take the wrath of god you all deserve and give you my righteousness in return . ’ it is important to note that the teachings of pacifism are not as clear cut as you may think . "" but i tell you , do n't resist him who is evil ; but whoever strikes you on your right cheek , turn to him the other also . "" it is instructing us to not respond to insults with violence but to stand our ground and not give in to the taunting , allowing the opponent to back off or escalate as they will ( offering the other cheek ) . in fact , before he was born government tried to ban jesus and 33 years later government succeeded in killing him . furthermore , god has always had the power to strip humans of choice and responsibility and he has chosen not to despite the better outcomes . we can not emulate god or jesus to use the force of government to strip people of choice and responsibility . jesus makes a clear distinction between the laws of god and the laws of governments . for some a gun is a representation of defense or a means to provide or war and violence . either way it 's hard to say that jesus would n't have owned a firearm given that god has instructed people to take up arms in defense and in war . your cmv seems to indicate why christians should n't own guns for themselves , not why they should advocate for stricter gun laws , as the title suggests . as for the cmv , maybe a christian would n't use a gun to protect themselves , but what about their families , or other people ? i would point out that jesus did use a whip on the money changers and he also instructed peter to sell his cloak and buy a sword . the lesson i take from that is that peaceful tactics and methods are always preferred , but sometimes you do need to throw down and when that happens you should have the tools to do so . he would n't use a gun against another person , but i do n't recall him saying anything about the ownership of a weapon ."

[ 15 ] republicans , in these two examples , tended to reject inherited elites and aristocracies , but left open two questions : whether a republic , to restrain unchecked majority rule , should have an unelected upper chamber — perhaps with members appointed as meritorious experts — and whether it should have a constitutional monarch . though conceptually separate from democracy , republicanism included the key principles of rule by consent of the governed and sovereignty of the people . in effect , republicanism held that kings and aristocracies were not the real rulers , but rather the whole people were . exactly how the people were to rule was an issue of democracy : republicanism itself did not specify a means . [ 48 ] in the united states , the solution was the creation of political parties that reflected the votes of the people and controlled the government ( see republicanism in the united states ) . many exponents of republicanism , such as benjamin franklin , thomas paine , and thomas jefferson were strong promoters of representative democracy .

9vbs7s,"civil same-sex marriage causes no problem at all to society in general . i 've looked for rational arguments , preferably based on scientifical findings ( and not on religion ) , for this . i ca n't seem to find any . 1 . it does n't affect in any way straight people who want to get married . they still can , same as before . "" traditional "" families would not be affected in any shape or form . 2 . it prevents forced and likely disfuncional marriages , where people wanting to build a family , but being homosexual , would have to marry someone of the opposite sex , to whom they 're not really attracted . 3 . it just extends a freedom and a right to more people , without curtailing any rights of others . 4 . no religion would ever be obliged to perform ceremonies for those people . i 'm only talking about civil-legal marriages . 5 . a civil servant would not be endorsing anything by carrying out the procedure , just doing their bureaucratic duty . if they refuse to do so , they should be relocated to other functions , with no punishment . a civil servant should just be neutral about such things .","so if environmental factors play a role in being gay , and we can control those environmental factors ( by , for example , not normalizing gayness ) , then we can reduce the number of gay people in society . before same-sex marriage became legal throughout the us , one of the arguments people used to oppose it was that it required changing the meaning of marriage . to these people , marriage was something in particular , and you could no more change what marriage was by calling it something else than you can change a cube into a sphere merely by calling it a sphere . so the concern for these people was that if you start including things like same-sex relationships in the definition of marriage , then it would follow that marriage does n't actually have any particular meaning except for the one that any society can arbitrarily attach to it . if that 's the case , then marriage really has no meaning , and if marriage has no meaning , then people will cease to value marriage , and this will result in the decline or destruction of marriage , including traditional marriage . so this whole thing was kind of a sociological argument for the effects of changing the meaning of marriage to include same-sex couples . if fewer people value marriage as a result of the legalization of same-sex marriage , then same-sex marriage does create problems in societies . the reason the government is involved in marriage at all is because marriage is a benefit to society . the more stable marriages are , the more stable families are , and the more stable families are , the better off society is psychologically . there are studies that show that children do better who grow up in stable families with both parents than in unstable homes with divorce or single parents . one of the primary arguments against no fault divorce is that it destabilizes families which is bad for society as a whole . anything that destabilizes families , then , would be bad for society as a whole . if government were no longer involved in marriage , then there would no longer be government/tax incentives for couples to stay together , and that would destabilize families . if the existence of same-sex marriage causes people to oppose government involvement in marriage , then the existence of same-sex marriage destabilizes families , which creates problems with society as a whole . and if the existence of same-sex marriage causes people to devalue marriage altogether ( on the basis that it 's a meaningless or arbitrary concept ) , then same sex-marriage creates a problem for societies . what i mean is that there are a number of countries in the world which are theocracies and their laws are based on their holy books ( and leaders ) . so while all your points are valid in most western societies , theocratic ones are a different beast . for them to recognize a same sex union , they would have to recognize that their holy books ( only talking about theocracies that ban homosexuality , or homosexual unions ) are not actually the True source of laws . so if i am the leader of the country because i lead the religion of the country , and we have decided that the book is no longer absolute , does that mean the entire government needs to be re-visited ? and once we start down that road , we open a whole giant can of worms , because the entire foundation of the society is no longer solid . so while it can clearly be argued that these changes may in fact be good , trying to explore and implement the changes will cause significant hardship ( read : problems ) for that society to re-establish its entire foundation because we have thrown out the entire rule book ."

9vbeld,"there is not an affordable housing crises , there is a government regulation on housing crises . let me be perfectly clear - i am not a "" free-market solves all "" type of guy . i generally support policies with good intentions to improve the lives of our residents . the reason housing is so expensive is simply a problem of over-regulation . the government is responsible for 100 % of this burden through two things . first , local zoning that prohibits the highest-and-best use on land in favor of car-dominated development . most communities require large setbacks , lot size minimums , and other arbitrary regulations that increase the cost of building a house . the reason for these regulations is existing homeowners want them to keep out smaller houses and potentially "" less-desirable "" neighbors . secondly , local building codes that do not allow for any variance or exceptions . many years ago poorer people could afford houses because they did not have all the niceties that we expect now . if builders were allowed to build to a lesser standard those houses would be cheaper amd poorer people might be able to afford them . as it sits now , regulations make new houses so expensive only wealthy people can afford them . to counteract these two pieces of over-regulation the government has decided to fund certain projects with local and/or state tax money . in effect the government has driven the prices higher to a point where they need to help fund projects . the simplier and cheaper option would be to reduce their own regulations . the highest-priced neighborhoods in the country were all built before zoning really existed yet current zoning prohibits those exacts neighborhoods . if we want to replicate these neighborhoods we need to allow the market to direct their development . this is all the proof we need to show the regulations of zoning and building codes are actually making things worse , not better .","as for what kind of housing that 's being built , its the kind for people who are moving her for net better pay even if they will spend as much as $ 2k a month on rent . this is merely 1 example of what the home construction industry builds for . now i 'll be honest , some regulations do play into the affordable housing crisis , but looking at regulation as the cause alone is insufficient to explain our current conundrum . in order to help show why this is the case , let me respond to your view piece-by-piece . now it 's True that these regulations increase housing costs , but i would disagree that they 're arbitrary . starting with lot sizes , this is a practical necessity in communities where there is n't sufficient public transportation , as having a car is often needed for work . in cities where there are n't / were n't strong lot requirements , scarcity can drive the price of a parking spot up astronomically , making it a significant burden on local residents . while this issue could be resolved through better public transportation , such initiatives usually take a significant amount of time and money , which still leaves us with an immediate affordable housing crisis . moving onto some of the other regulations you mentioned , while some may be pointless , others could be set up for a good reason . when it comes to building a significant number of new affordable homes , we have to keep in mind the invisible parts of a city , like the underlying infrastructure . when we factor in these issue , what becomes increasingly clear is that a lot of communities simply are n't designed in a way that allows for a significant influx of affordable development . although local housing regulations are frustrating , they may be needed to make sure cities and towns are able to function as designed . major infrastructure projects could help alleviate these issues , but again time and funding burdens make this a poor solution to the immediate housing crisis . the thing is , our issue is n't with regulation per se , but instead with lack of government oversight and authority to enforce existing affordable housing laws . many states have laws requiring municipalities to ensure a certain amount of affordable housing within their borders , but these requirements are n't always enforced as they should be . speaking from my own life experience , i come from a town that only began meeting its affordable housing requirements after the state detected that it was n't following the law , and then sued to force it into action . as others have mentioned , part of the reason why regulations on individual homes have become more expensive is because of safety concerns . over time we 've gradually increased building standards in order to make sure homes are exceedingly safe generally , and moreover built to withstand local weather or natural allowing builders to construct to a lower standard would help alleviate some housing issues in the very short term , but would leave low-income renters/buyers with residences that were both dangerous and likely to degrade significantly over time . at best , this would mean affordable home buyers would be left with property that is likely to lose value and require major repairs over time , draining even more wealth from the working class . as a result , we would simply kick the housing crisis down the road instead of actually solving the problem in a meaningful way . firstly , and especially in high rent areas where land is expensive , developers have little motivation to build affordable housing . if they can still rent or sell for a fairly high price just lower than their competitors ' , which is likely in some of the most competitive housing markets today , doing so makes more sense than providing truly affordable living spaces . as such , while overall prices might drop somewhat , it 's not at all a sure bet that they would drop far enough to meet the needs of citizens who require affordable homes . adding to this , new developments would n't deal with the issues posed by wealthy individuals buying properties as a way of shifting their wealth , or in order to speculate on the property market by buying and reselling housing as prices rise . in these cases homes are bought and sold without ever being occupied , artificially raising prices and disincentivizing the construction of affordable housing . that having been said , i actually do share your feeling that the current system of tax subsidizing development projects is pretty dumb . this approach has proven to be hugely expensive , does n't produce enough affordable housing to meet community needs , and is rife with potential for abuse . however , i would argue that a much better solution would be spending tax money directly on government controlled building projects , with the aim of producing cost-controlled affordable housing . although this is True , i would contend that modern zoning laws have been created to address many of the problems found in these property markets . while these areas , cities in particular , may have found economic success , they often face major infrastructural caused by the original lack of zoning laws and building regulations . by deregulating we make some housing available in the short term , but expand these problems to new areas in the long term , which is both expensive and potentially dangerous for new communities . some of what you are saying is correct , bad regulation plays a large role , but the solution is better regulation , not less . it is cheaper for builders to build out instead of up , building out has all of the problems of sprawl without the efficiencies of dense urban centers . so this is not a problem that free markets can solve on their own , in states/areas with limited zoning/development planning the default is suburban development , it 's cheaper . i think you might also be mixing up styles of development/zoning planning , yes cities like sf have stupid height limits , and barriers on density ... but suburban places have just the opposite , so like i said the problem is not regulation and the need for the free market , the problem is bad regulation . no regulation can go either way , yes maybe some dense development , but also the possibility of tenement slums and unsafe conditions , think no fire code , no sanitation requirements etc. . check out this book the green metropolis its all about dense urban development and how it is better than what alot of our zoning right now promotes . - regulation was a contributor but not 100 % responsible like your argument states . my main point about regulation is you cant throw the baby out with the bath water . - measuring the number of unaffordable housing units first requires a definition of affordability . in this debate , a unit is considered unaffordable if a household has to spend more than 30 percent of its income on it ... we find that the housing "" crisis "" is heavily concentrated among one subset of the population — poor renters . first , low incomes lead households to spend most of their income on necessities , like housing . second , government regulation , in part designed to improve quality , can increase the cost of housing so that it is unaffordable . the costs imposed by land-use regulation can be particularly pronounced for the lowest-cost units . - after examining the data for the united states and for the twin cities , a metropolitan area reputed to have a severe affordable housing shortage , we find that low incomes are the primary reason why the poor live in unaffordable rental units . even if costs fell significantly — by an amount roughly equal to estimates of the increase in cost due to regulation — the vast majority of the poor living in the united states and the twin cities would still live in rental units considered unaffordable . in some areas of the country , such as california and greater new york city , regulation may play a large role in explaining high housing cost-to-income ratios . however , others have come to similar conclusions that these select areas are the exception rather than the rule ( see glaeser and gyourko 2002 , for example ) . - if policymakers believe that housing cost-to-income ratios are too high for low-income households , they should provide low-income households with additional cash or federal support , such as food stamps , for accessing other basic necessities such as food and medicine . after all , concern about a high housing cost-to-income ratio for low-income households only makes sense if housing costs prevent those households from buying other basic necessities .... concerns about affordability would assumedly disappear if households could spend over 30 percent of their income on housing and still acquire all the food , clothing and other necessities they need . cash or federal subsidies for nonhousing necessities offer a more cost-effective way of increasing access to nonhousing necessities than subsidies that must be used for housing - housing vouchers might prove less effective than production programs where government restrictions significantly impede the market supply of housing . in these cases , policymakers should consider the removal of regulations , a challenging task that will require balancing competing interests , including the desire to increase housing quality . - looking to income as a source of a social concern is not a novel proposition for policymakers . the current measure of poverty has its roots in the amount of income a household needs to buy an adequate amount of food . but when the number of households in poverty rises , policymakers and the public do not typically consider it evidence of an "" affordable food crisis "" that requires the planting of additional crops . there is no formal connection between the amount of subsidies that farmers receive and the number of households below the poverty level , nor do policymakers typically scrutinize agricultural processors and grocery stores to find a cause of high poverty rates . - malpezzi and green ( 1996 , p. 1811 ) found that "" high quality new construction is associated with a growth in the low quality stock . ... in 1995 ... new units led to an increase of nearly 2.5 percent in sub-standard rental units . "" - although the private market appears capable of providing units that would meet affordability standards for the very poor , this solution has an important drawback . in housing markets , the actions of one household or firm can strongly influence the quality of life of neighboring households . for example , the owner of an apartment complex that lets the building fall in quality also has a negative effect on the value of the units nearby ( a new building of very low quality could have the same effect ) . the owner of the building whose value is depressed might have less incentive to maintain its units , which , in turn , reduces the value of other units in the vicinity . the result is that a private market might produce housing units that are cheap but which have too low a quality level . local governments regulate land use in many ways , including restricting the types of housing built ( e.g. , apartments vs. single-family homes ) as well as dictating the attributes of that housing ( e.g. , number of garages ) . while these rules could increase the quality of housing , they can reduce the availability of low-cost housing by , for example , limiting the total number of housing units produced in a community . as mcfate ( 1999 , p. 172 ) summarized , "" we have regulated substandard housing out of existence — the result is that the poor have safer but more expensive housing , and less money available for other goods . "" ( see working paper appendix 3 for a discussion of quality trends in rental markets . ) we have described two possible causes for the fact that most very poor renters live in unaffordable units : too little income or too much regulation . because unaffordable units are almost all occupied by the poor , our expectation is that income plays a larger role than regulation . i do n't know for sure about other parts of the country , but i can tell you that in la , houses are insanely expensive not because of the nicer building amenities , size , etc . it 's an area that went up in value wildly within the past 2 decades . this house was built in 1924 , it 's less than 1000 sq ft. you are paying for the land . figure some other things to help make housing more affordable . people used to be able to buy a home easily , that should be the case again . building codes exist to prevent houses from being shoddily built death traps or fire hazards . government regulation , especially in the form of maintaining low-density zoning in highly desirable areas , definitely contributes to affordable housing problems ."

however poor , alone or handicapped . so yours is a "" moral cover "" , an argument some parent in this situation might give others and himself , in order not to deal with the difficulty/suffering of raising such a child . i 'm no one to judge of course , it 's impossible to be certain of what one would wish to do in such a situation . there are plenty of examples throughout history of individuals with a disability going on to perform great deeds . just because you do n't remember being a baby does n't mean they 're not sentient beings . it just means you do n't remember , like plenty other things you forgot . think about how much of a big deal it was . sorry if this sounds dark but i think when their old enough they should be able to choose whether they live or not and the government has some kind of humane death for them eg kill them while under the stuff they give you during surgery sorry i forgot the name of it everything you said is based on your definition of what qualifies as a good life but , historically speaking , when people try to qualify life , they fail miserably . if you gave parents the deciding factor in stifling the life of a disabled newborn then your cmv would still stand , that it is inconsiderate of their future . a parent ca n't predict the life their baby will have . the only thing we know for sure is if you kill the baby before it has a chance to decide what life it is leading , that is immoral being born without limbs isnt actually that much of a disability in terms what you can do in the future . we are starting research into bionical limbs that respond to neural commands . a man literally wrote academic essays and was praised to be the genius of our times , while being completely disabled . sure that child will be born with suffering , but they can achieve so much in life if given the chance . a more extreme version of what you are saying , but what if we killed everybody with als ? well they would stop suffering , and save society the burden of carrying them . if the goal of humanity is to eventually live in a perfect society , sickness should n’t be criminalized , it should be considered a problem to be cured . it may be 50 years , or 500 years , but eventually a cure will be found . some people with terrible deseases probably want to die , but you can be damn sure that they wish to be cured before that , however unlikely . by simply existing , sick people , with any ailment , make it so people in the future who suffer from said ailment have a chance at a fruitful unimpaired life . to you , what is the practical difference between an adult who is born without limbs and an adult who lost their limbs as a child ? we ca n't decide the value in another person 's life ."
9vah6h,"if you support facebook/twitter/google de-platforming or removing conservative voices , you should also support bakeries ( or other privately owned businesses ) denying services to whomever they please . this is my view - although i tend to lean right , i support twitter/facebook/etc banning conservative voices because at the end of the day they 're not a public institution and they 're not obliged to provide a platform to political or cultural positions they may not agree with . while i may disagree , that 's their choice and i 'm against the government weighing in and making them provide a platform to said people . however , i feel there is cognitive dissonance here on the part of the left . i see a lot of people in comment threads/twitter mocking conservatives when they get upset about getting banned , but at the same time these are the people that bring out the pitchforks when a gay couple is denied a wedding cake by a bakery - a privately owned company denying service to those whose views they do n't agree with . so cmv - if you support twitter/facebook/etc 's right to deny services to conservatives based on their views , you should also support bakeries/shops/etc 's right to deny service in the other direction .","the bakeries are being criticised for not serving gay people specifically . instead the are de-platforming and removing abusive and general behavior rule breaking "" voices "" , which sometimes happen to be conservative . like , no one is against bakeries being able to kick you out if you walk in and start verbally abusing other customers . that 's why it 's okay for a restaurant to refuse service to you for being belligerent and harassing customers or employees , but not for simply being a certain gender , color , or sexual orientation . i think that many of these websites have been incredibly forgiving in regards to allowing conservatives to break their tos rather than applying their own rules . i think they 've done so with liberals too and some have gotten banned but not enough there either . i do n't think you can make that argument for conservatives . i do n't recall any social media platforms banning anyone for expressing conservative views . what i do recall is social media platforms banning people who incidentally happen to be conservative because those people broke the rules against harassment . however , there is a second , more modern definition of the word "" discrimination "" that implies an intentional harm or offense caused to an individual . rather , opponents of the bakeries argue that their "" discrimination "" is specifically the modern , offensive kind . the social media platforms are shutting people down based on actions , not characteristics . to eliminate the double standard , the furthest you can argue is that companies should be allowed to deny services based on actions alone . for companies that deny service based on unavoidable characteristic , like race , you have n't shown a cognitive dissonance . they are n't removing people for being conservative . they 're removing them for being outspoken in their conservative views , which is an action , not a characteristic . the most you can argue is that companies should be allowed to deny services to whomever they please based on visible actions . how you are born , what gender you are , whether you are gay or not , is beyond your control . youre trying to compare something that is a willful and voluntary choice with something that is not , which is an incredibly weak argument and huge stretch of the two situations . in addition , they are n't banning anyone for being a conservative voice . they are banning people for what they say , which again , is a voluntary choice . i say it 's based on the context of the situation , as established in planned parenthood v. casey ( granted , that was about abortion , but hear me out ) . my car breaks down in the desert and there is only one mechanic for miles . if there was a neighboring mechanic , then let the guy lose business , but if there is n't one for miles , then i am being denied a service in the midst of an emergency . per the mechanic in the desert scenario , if the mechanic said the conservative ca n't speak in the store , the conservative can still go outside and scream to the top of their lungs if they would like . they are not unilaterally banning anyone who is conservative though . in contrast , all that most of these gay couples do is ... be gay . in the facebook/twitter/google situation people were using the service to attack/harass people and advocate for or organise violence . in the bakery people were using the service to get cake while being gay . if they had ordered a cake that said "" kill all straight people "" then of course the bakery should be able to say no . i think there 's a distinction to be drawn between bakeries "" denying service "" and bakeries refusing to design or letter cakes with a particular message . this begs the question "" is facebook deplatforming voices for being conservative ? "" twitter is not acting in a partisan manner by enforcing its tos , nor is it denying service based on a particular trait , but on the behavior . last time i checked , bigotry and lunacy are n't conservative ideals , nor are they liberal ideals . there is nothing conservative about hating someone because of their skin color or who they love . proper conservative speech ( e.g. small government , controlled immigration , low taxes , low regulation , etc ) has never been censored or de-platformed and never will be . also , you can not change your skin color , you can not change your orientation , you can not magically make your disabilities go away , and so on , which is why it 's unfair to discriminate based on those traits . on the other hand , you can change your beliefs and indeed many former bigots have reformed and become welcomed back into society . the issue with permitting companies to deny service to anyone is that you will then have swathes of the country where minorities can not live and women can not operate independently . are you saying people who support these laws should think that the existing laws should apply to facebook etc. , or are you saying that they should support new laws to guarantee that nazi 's have access to facebook ? you are trying to equivocate what someone is like being black or gay with something someone chooses to do and say such as being a bigot or a nazi . nazis and bigots in general tend to wish to do harm to other people . banning gay people from a cake shop is hateful , because they did n't choose to be gay . there is no sane or reasonable ethical framework that calls for the exclusion of such people . there is no reasonable , or objective , or ethical way to get to where a gay couple can be descriminated against and there is good reason to object to banning nazis from publishing hate speech . the first makes a video about how gay marriage is totally cool . the second makes a video about how gassing jews is totally cool . race , color , disability , sex , sexual orientation ( including transgender status ) , national origin / ancestry , creed , marital status , retaliation ( in colorado where the bakery case happened ) in this case the argument was that not making the cake was affecting a protected class and it was illegal . a tech company can deny access to their platform if you 're conservative for the same reason the cake company can , they ca n't for the protected class reasons . if you support group a refusing to serve group b because of things they can not change ( race , gender , sexual orientation ) , then you must support group c refusing to serve group d based on things they can change ( violating terms of service , voicing an opinion ) . if you ca n't appreciate the difference between "" i do n't serve gay / black / protestant people "" and "" you have been banned for violating the terms of service "" then i du n no , that 's kinda bad . progressives do n't have cognitive dissonance regarding these separate issues because they are not basing their support on the idea that ' private companies can do what they want ' . instead , they are basing it on the fact those groups are either committing fraud ( by telling their listeners what they are saying is True when it 's actually not True ) or are supporting/engaging in violations of the basic american principle that all people are equal when it comes to basic rights ( including the right to commerce ) so they can support the bannings because we do n't allow liars to sell their lies , and they support the condemnation of the bakeries , etc. because we do n't allow bigots to violate people 's rights ."
9v9qcm,"i do n't think not voting or paying taxes is the ethical solution to a corrupt government . our government is highly corrupt , okay ? we 're talking purchasing military equipment worth hundreds of millions of euros while the health system is in obvious disarray , the youths getting more and more radicalized by the church and the cutthroat nationalist rhetoric , the migrant crisis being handled in a manner of the 1400s , school system in the dumps ( at the rear of european rankings ) , a secular state with crosses littering the classrooms and delivery rooms , minister of health who claims that ' why would anyone question the fact that a kid recently died in a small city on the outskirts of the capital because there were no ambulances available ( they were n't out on calls , there simply were none ) , because , you know , he is a doctor and you are not ' , a proposal to a law banning legal abortions in the works , etc . and the economic situation is getting worse by the day , something on which voters for both the left and the right agree . now , i 've been having a long-winded discussion with my wife ( she is a sociologist , and a very good one at that - which makes it that more difficult for me to argue with her on the topic of politics/sociology ) for the past couple of days . it boils down to this : & #x200b ; 1 ) she says that we should not pay taxes to a corrupt government . i say that we should . her argument : she thinks that it is alright not to pay taxes , as these guys will just spend it on new military equipment ( which we do n't need ) and their ludicrous bonuses ( which they do n't need ) and the church ( which i definitely do n't want to finance ) , etc . my argument : i think that this is not the solution to anything , and that the country will be even worse off than it is . if i pay taxes and 3 of my neighbors do n't , it does n't solve anything , no one is going to give up their place in the parliament - and there will now be even less money for hospitals , roads , schools , etc . 2 ) she claims that her not voting is a good thing . i say that it 's not . her argument : since there is no one to vote for , why should she ? either way , this country will be worse off - whoever gets her vote . the left and the right in our country are equally bad , on that we agree . my argument : however , i claim that it 's not the case , and that certain changes can be made by voting - disrupting the entrenched positions of the two political parties that switch places every couple of years , shaking the status quo a bit , bringing forth some new , more progressive political faces to the forefront , etc . & #x200b ; my theoretical knowledge of the topic is sparse , compared to hers , and i would like to get a bunch of different insights into the topic at hand . cheers !","however , voting should never be the starting and stopping point for citizens in functional democracy . but you would probably need a lot of people not paying taxes and it wo n't work as an isolated tactic . on the other hand , you seem to hand wave away the moral problem , or at least the moral problem about how your country treats others , and instead focus on the side effects it will have on you and your community given the system currently . government employees ca n't give themselves bonuses so i do n't really understand her argument maybe you could clarify . this sends the message that you do n't like any of the options while also participating . when your government is corrupt , and it 's really big and really powerful like under socialism , it infects absolutely everything and it 's especially hard to hold them accountable . but voting to support using taxes for this is essentially claiming that other people should have to pay for this as well . if both options are equally bad , then it does n't particularly matter which you vote for . not voting , or voting for a third option , or writing in something ridiculous ( i enjoy writing in cthulhu for races that are unopposed ) , expresses one 's discontentment with the options presented ."
9v9ozk,"dictatorships make more sense within the left wing compared to the right wing . alright lads/lasses , this was a thought i had it 's not my position on this . & #x200b ; the idea goes as such : left wing politics focuses on the collective society compared to the right which focuses on the individual . therefore it stands to reason that collectivisation is easier to be pushed towards authoratarianism then the right which is roughly speaking closer to libatarianism . & #x200b ; i understand anything vaugly supportive of the right is hated on reddit , i am not stating an opinion it was just a thought i wanted to discuss , that being said thank you for any responses ! & #x200b ;","dictatorships can be wielded by either wing ; neither left or right has a monopoly on autocracy . for example , a collectivist/socialist mentality is philosophically opposed to dictatorship because the dictator is enforcing their individual view on the collective against the collective decision making contrariwise , dictatorships can and do arise on the right ( e.g. fascist autocrats ) because there is a stronger belief in individual hierarchies and superiority , and those in the overclass may support the dictator from their overclass to oppress the underclass . alternatively , a right wing society may believe in a religious or other mandate based on the innate superiority of the dictator as an individual ( i.e. by taking control , the dictator is the most successful and therefore most fit for governance ) . nationalism , in its many shapes and forms , does not focus on the individual at all and is pretty common in the right wing . the right wing side of politics , especially in america , tend to believe that society must have heavy law enforcement to maintain order . right wing dictators can come about by forcing a police state in the name of national sexurity and declaring whoever thay want as an enemy of the state , and justifying it through ' law and order ' - a phrase you almost always hear from the right in america , not the left . and the right has given up their individualistic beliefs in favor of policing people 's lives before - they are the ones who mostly still support the war on drugs , opposition to gay marriage ( strictly keeping marriage as one man-one woman ) , opposition to abortion rights and bodily autonomy , just to name a few of these situations . this means he can not be directly interfered with by any group . this is unlike democracy which encourages for people to be looked at as a voter block . democracy on the other hand favours the lefts segmentation of society . take a look at the nolan chart which is n't the best description of reality , but holds some truth nonetheless . in the two axes of personal freedom and economic freedom , the right and the left describe belief in limiting one and promoting the other , while an authoritarian dictatorship has to limit both . the mainstream left or the mainstream right in particular countries today can happen be closer to authoritarianism than the other , but as a general rule neither is . suppose we agree on your characterization of the left and right : in what way would a dictator , who is one individual , be more fitting for a society based on collectivism as opposed to a society which focuses on individuals ? here in the us , conservatives are very willing to suspend individual rights for collective security . my point is , the right are happy to suspend what many view as rights of individuals to encourage a collective morality that meets their standards . they are also happy to trade the freedom of a few individuals for perceived security . a dictatorship by definition is just what happens when the leader does not need the support of the population . there seem to be some trade off between whether a dictator 's political survival is better served by left wing or right wing ideologies . i think left wing ideologies are more useful if the main threat to the dictator 's power is from the people themselves . right wing ideologies are more useful if the main threat is a coup . a communist system is going to by necessity have a large number of powerful bureaucrats and these people are all potential rivals or could be swayed to support the leader 's opponents . but the advantage is that you maintain a high degree of control over your population . i think this was what we saw in the soviet union when the leader would get replaced somewhat frequently by some rival who managed to gain the support of enough important people . it 's hard to imagine north korea 's population successfully revolting but it 's entirely possible that one of kim jong un 's rivals could gain the support of enough generals to replace him , albeit with someone just as bad or worse . dictators do n't act for the collective good , they enrich themselves and their cronies , despite what they might actually preach , their actions are what matters . these are tactics that can only be justified if one holds a supreme belief in the individual over the community . in fact in most of those states the leader is viewed as god like , which again is the focus on the one , in this case a "" supreme "" leader and what that one individual wants ."

"" engineer "" is not a legally protected title anywhere i know of . but your friend is not calling himself a professional engineer , so they are not breaking the law . is it ok for someone with a phd to be called doctor if they do not have a medical license ? it varies from state to state and i do n't have a good overview of the whole country but in the us this sort of regulation is at the state level . i will answer for texas because they have what are almost certainly the strongest regulations in the us . subsection ( f ) of 1001.301 says that they can call themselves an engineer if they work for a company that is exempt from licensing if they do n't offer services outside of that company . so many people hate the setup that it will eventually change because no one wants to take it ( how 's your friends chemistry and power engineering background ? i think the law is still unsettled even in texas when it comes to software engineers but it looks like at least in texas you are right . i ca n't find any evidence of anyone ever getting into trouble over this though even thought glassdoor says there are 3000 openings for software engineers in austin alone , so there must be tens of thousands of people with this title in texas . licensing to be a professional engineer comes from state affiliates of the national society of professional engineers . the national society of professional engineers is very relevant in your field of civil engineering . in my profession as an electrical engineer working on embedded systems , the national society of professional engineers is n't relevant . having the pe certification would not make a potential employee more hirable ( maybe there 's an exception if the ee is working with civil engineers but then we 're back to square 1 ) . until then , our entire industry will continue to ignore it , and we 'll continue to "" misuse "" the term "" engineer "" in a way that is relevant to our field even the way we are using it is n't applicable to yours . i do not have a pe , the vast majority of people with engineer in their job title in similar positions to me do n't have their pe and do n't intend to get one . i agree with the point you are making , however it is also entirely acceptable for someone who has finished a degree in engineering who chooses a career in research to have the title of engineer . i 'm okay with calling someone who has a bachelors degree in engineering an engineer if they do engineering work . there are lots of positions where you do work extremely similar to a professional engineer with just a bachelors in engineering . most of being a professional engineer is you can now officially sign off on things and ensure public safety . but the difference between someone who has their pe license and someone who just has just passed their fe can be pretty minimal . for example someone trying to increase the efficiency of a car engine would be doing engineering work , but would n't need to be a pe . but if you were signing off on distributing that engine you better be a pe . if you pay money and follow a licensing body 's rules , they give you a special designation that means you are qualified . the bureau of labor statistics says there are 1.6 million practicing engineers in the us . that means that either half the engineers in the us are not really engineers despite having university degrees in engineering and engineering jobs , or the ncees is not the True decider of who is an engineer or not . but many other fields that have tried to follow suit have failed . it 's hard to argue that a skilled haircutter who calls himself a barber is n't a real barber because he did n't pay for and pass a cosmetology exam . if a high school student applies chemistry in a way that creates a new green way to refine fuel and continues to innovate , she 's a chemical engineer , regardless of whether she has a title , license , or degree . engineering is all about scientific knowledge and application , not tradition and bureaucracy . and we could pass a constitutional amendment saying that nobody can call themselves an engineer unless they 're 6 ' 3 "" and it 's a tuesday . maritime history and tradition along with the etymology of the word granted me the title of engineer . i held no licenses or accreditation and was not at all the type of engineer you ’re talking about . i was the person who works on the engines and was therefore called the engineer , which makes more linguistic sense than calling the person who designs software an engineer . or the person who plans the roads of a new subdivision or mixes sound on a record or designs a half-mile long suspension bridge . you can own licenses , accreditations and certifications and can take civil or criminal legal action against someone who Falsely represents having them but i do n’t think you can own words or titles . if i do the work of an engineer ( any variety of engineer ) and get paid to do it i think i can legally call myself a professional engineer . i am not aware of any law that prohibit people from calling themselves "" engineers . "" ncees restricts practice of certain types of work ( e.g. , preparing and submit public works engineering plans and drawings ) to licensed professionals . i can assure you that your friend who is development operations engineer does not engage in any sort of work that would require a pe licence , so he does not break any rules . i got a b.sc in ee and cs , i got a diploma and all but i dont require a license to do what i do the choice of "" professional engineer "" for the legally required certification for civil engineers was also made in the distant past , when these laws were written . however , it 's pure hubris to presume that legal authority over the term "" professional engineer "" grants any authority over the word "" engineer "" . it 's troubling that it restricts "" software professional engineer "" to civil only , some sort of subset of pes that work through software . it 's not the case that this requirement applies to "" professional software engineers "" . sure , this could have been clearer if pe was pce for "" professional civil engineer "" , but that 's changing the law , much more difficult than changing your view . while some laws address only "" surgeon "" as a job requirement , most only require "" md "" . under no case would a requirement for "" brain surgeon "" imply that "" heart surgeon "" ca n't use the term surgeon . where i live , engineering professional licenses are only used when you need to put your signature and seal on plans . calling yourself an engineer or not does n't matter as only signed documents count . it seems like you may think that the term ‘ engineer ’ ought to be defined through legal concerns . i evaluate materials for chemical and mechanical properties , perform failure analysis , cost analysis , etc ."
9v5t3l,"it 's a good thing if the party split in the us congress prevents us from getting anything done over the remainder of trump 's term . with the democrats taking control of the house while republicans continue to hold the senate , the us congress is now split for the first time in a while . with the increasing polarization of us political parties , it 's a virtual guarantee that no controversial bills are likely to pass for at least the next two years . with trump at the top , it seems to me that this is a good thing . the "" wall "" is not going to get funding , obamacare wo n't be repealed , no crazy anti-green energy/anti-gay bills will make it through , etc . i understand that a government shutdown over budget issues is a possibility and is not a good thing , but in such a situation the two sides are under extreme pressure to compromise and will eventually work it out . most of the "" routine "" bills that are boring but essential for basic government functions will be passed anyway as they rarely become partisan issues . & #x200b ; am i missing something ? would n't a congressional lockdown be a good thing , at least until trump is out of office ?","not everything that trump suggests is going to be bad . are you saying it 's a good thing nothing will get done or a good thing trump 's agenda wo n't be passed ? obstructionism is never good , because republicans can do the same thing the next time there is a democrat in office . democrats in congress are actually voting against the interests of their supporters simply because they want to make trump look bad . if you look at it from a democrat point of view ( as opposed to somebody who wants all those things to happen ) , if republicans had two more years to try and repeal obamacare , pass anti-gay legislation , or whatever , and they actually did some of those things , that might be enough to spur a blue wave in the next election . first , it 's not a guarantee that a split congress will not pass any controversial bills over the next two years . in fact , a split congress is going to open up the possibility of deals being struck for different things . for example , trump 's executive order to rescind daca is currently pending in federal courts . trump is already signaling that he is willing to trade rebooting the program for getting border wall funding . obamacare has already been significantly damaged by the tax bill removing the tax penalties for not having insurance and a multiple executive orders from trump . another important note to keep in mind is that a split congress could actually benefit trump and republicans in the long run . she has been made the ultimate republican boogeyman because they know it can rile up their base when she returns to being speaker of the house . if a government shutdown occurs and nothing really bad happens they can simultaneously blame democrats for people not getting paid , while also using it as "" proof "" that nothing will happen if they cut future government spending . and finally , and most importantly , republicans can achieve plenty will just senate control . all presidential appointments , which most importantly include all federal judges , are solely determined by the senate . losing the house will not stop the republicans from filling every judicial vacancy and any future scotus picks over the next two years . about 1/6 of the current circuit judges and about an 1/8 of district judges have been either appointed or nominated by trump in his first two years . 84 judges confirmed , 54 pending and there 's still 75 more current vacancies to fill . and they are all being filled with people that will be able to serve 20 or 30 , if not 40 years as judges before the retire . republicans can and will set the course of the generation with just the next two years of judicial nominees . these judges will be in charge of reviewing any legal challenges to gay marriage , abortion , campaign finance laws , environmental policy , police misconduct , gun rights , gerrymandering , and so much more . the past two years alone have greatly shifted the supreme court . and it 's entirely possible that by 2020 a quarter to a third of all federal judges could be trump 's picks . hell , it 's entirely possible that rbg or breyer could pass away in the next two years and guarantee the supreme court to stay conservative for the next 30 years ."
9v58pr,"it 's a net good that humans number 7.6 billion and most likely even better if/when we reach 2-3x that number . overpopulation is an unreasonable fear . i will list two common arguments against large human population and why they fail on the evidence and then explain why a larger global population is good . popular arguments against 1 . limited resources/starvation . i would agree it is theoretically possible we may come to carrying capacity . but we 're nowhere near there now . malnutrition and famine were vastly more common in the past , when the human population was a small fraction of what it is now . 2 . environmental disaster/species extinction / pollution . it is True that more people acting irresponsibly makes any given problem worse . but it is n't True ( within carrying capacity limits ) that more people = more environmental harm . a human population can live in more or less sustainable , harmful ways . again , in the past when the human population was much smaller , pollution and wildlife extinction were comparatively much worse than today . re : global warming , that 's a big problem , but it 's also a soluble one regardless of global population . so what 's good about having another billion people ? higher population densities are only possible in more-developed nations . as the global population has increased , it has coincided with there being more educated , industrialized and more-democratic nations . 1 . accelerates scientific and political progress . look at any bit of technology around you . from a street light to a computer . now you research the background of that thing and you realize the hundreds of incremental increases in knowledge and understanding that lead to its creation came from more than one place sufficient developed as to have scientists and inventors . more countries with such a base of investigation and innovation means more new ideas , more sources of collaboration . and not just in science and tech . there are , for example , numerous experiments with universal basic income going on around the world . if those work , other nations who did not do those experiments will benefit from that knowledge and may follow suit . but they have to exist for that to have been possible in the first place . 2 . community tends to bring better safety and security . it is a moderating force , whether we mean neighborhoods or a community of nations on earth . when a disaster strikes , say the 2010 haiti earthquake , millions in international aid from many countries comes in along with relief workers and emergency goods ( these things never come from countries that do n't exist , or that are incapable of rendering such aid ) . this sort of thing did n't used to . . be a thing . it would be an alien concept to anyone in the 16th century to send aid to some foreign nation they had no interest in or benefit from . when there are more countries "" at the table "" , selfish and aggressive nations are far more likely to be cowed or forced to be more cooperative for economic and political reasons . e.g. the us pulled out of the paris accords , but for many practical purposes , is nonetheless going along with the aims of those accords because it needs to maintain trade and relations with those who are . i want there to be more modern nation-states instead of 2-3 "" superpowers "" for the sake of peace and prosperity . i want more sources of science and innovation , and that requires higher populations and densities in more places . i want people who live in places with terrible standards of nutrition , healthcare , education , quality of life , and liberty to have better . that just is n't going to happen without economic and political development that also tends to spike the population .","when a population becomes too dense , their behavior begins to worsen , they become more stressed , depression is more common , their natural senses and instincts degrade . now this experiment was originally conducted in rats , maybe it translates to humans , maybe it does n't . you state that famine was worse previously , that is True , we have developed technologies that allow us to produce far more food per square kilometer than ever before . however these technologies undeniably have other side effects , many of which cause themselves to become unviable . methane from our animal farms is causing damage to the environment , this damage will reduce the physical land area accessable to humans , which directly reduces the space that we can fit residences and farm land in , thus reducing the amount of food we can produce for our increasing populations . now you can present the argument that if everyone was vegan then our diets would n't necessitate these amount of methane production , but that does n't stand up due to people , they wo n't change in large enough numbers to accommodate the necessary dietary changes . the only way that we do n't do too much damage to the planet to continue surviving long-term is if huge swaths of the western people 's change their lifestyle , which again wo n't happen unless people stop being greedy . the second issue with your counter argument is that most of the population is n't in western lifestyles . if the scientific and education changes you advocate for were to occur , then these people would have far more luxurious lifestyles . have a look at the damage caused per capita of the american lifestyle and imagine the billions in chinese and indian slums were at the same lifestyle , the world would be in a far far worse state than it is . developed nations use 60 % of the yearly consumed industrial materials while only making up 22 % of the population . that means if the remaining 78 % of the population were brought up to the developed nations standards then we would consume 263 % of the industrial materials we currently consume . america comprises 5 % of the words population , but uses 25 % of the energy of the world . if the rest of the world used the same per person energy as america , we would consume 500 % of the current amount . these increases in consumption come with accompanying pollution , environmental damage , inequality and land mass consumption . at the end of the day the problem with overpopulation is n't the number of people , if the consumption used by the developed countries . if we all lived like they do in the indian slums , we could probably have 100 billion people ( random number ) but that 's not what you are advocating for and what you are advocating for comes with too large an increase in consumption for current technologies ( next 50 years of technology as well ) to handle without just killing us off anyway . the current extinction rate is only matched by what was seen when the dinosaurs died off . very few people get to be scientists , very little money is invested in science , the pool of people is restricted to like a few percent of the population at most . earthquake threatened a systemic status quo among greek city states previously ensured by a robust military alliance between several states including athens and sparta ( french 1955 ) . according to thucydides ( 1985 ) , the spartans relied heavily on athenian disaster relief aid , and buy a few fewer fighters and invest more in science , we could trivially double that number . that would get you all the science benefits without the cost of more people ! in total science funding once you add up military funding , civilian funding , applied things that are nearly ready , cancer research , etc. , is like $ 157 billion . put that into perspective , the dod budget is $ 600 billion dollars and it includes about $ 50 billion in research funding ( included in the $ 157 billion number ) . it said that the rate at which we improve our food-growing capacity is basically constant . that means that if we add people , we ca n't also improve people 's lives as they are . if people get richer and lead better lives , so that scientific , political , and economic progress that you mentioned , they have fewer babies . so all that progress is really just going to cap the world 's population ."
9v4kuq,"it is not alarmist to describe trump ’s tactics and the movement he represents as fascistic . let ’s look at some features of fascism : 1 : great mythic past . “ make america great again ” is understood to mean an ideal time when society was ethnically homogenous , harshly patriarchal ( this harkens back to the protocols of the elders of zion with one of the conspiracies being that jews are behind the movement for gender equality ) , etc . 2 : propaganda . every kind of politics has propaganda . but fascist propaganda has a certain structure where everything gets inverted . this can mean the use of liberal ideals to undermine themselves : states ’ rights refer to the right to enslave people . hitler argued that the best democracy is a dictatorship : “ True german democracy ” . or that the news becomes fake news , anti-corruption becomes corruption ( they can talk about crooked hillary while at the same time trump himself has – perhaps to this day – routinely engaged in questionable dealings and has assembled a cabinet that has probably more conflicts of interest than any before it ) , etc . 3 : anti-intellectualism . attacking the universities as the hotbed of liberalism , feminism ( gender studies ) and perhaps most importantly marxism ! goebbels was clear that they had to paint ordinary social democracy as marxism - only then would the bourgeoise be frightened enough to support the nazis . and the second emotion besides fear is rage . steve bannon said rage gets people to the polls . they got elected on “ lock her up ” and “ build the wall ” . hitler in mein kampf says that you want your propaganda to appeal to the least educated people . 4 : unreality . reality is the greatest threat to fascism because fascism is based on power and reality is a way of responding to power : you say it ’s just False ! therefore , they must smash truth . reason gets replaced by conspiracy theories ( the soros globalist conspiracy paying protesters and importing migrants to europe and north america , qanon , pizzagate , etc. ) . arendt is clear about this in the origins of totalitarianism : “ totalitarian propaganda establishes a world fit to compete with the real one , whose main handicap is that it is not logical , consistent and organized ” . interestingly enough ( almost ) everyone recognizes the logical inconsistencies : after edgar maddison welch tried to violently rescue the enslaved children in the pizzagate restaurant he was immediately denounced by alex jones as a spy for the democratic party . why ? if you really believed the conspiracy would n’t it be your duty to free them ? so , you ’re not meant to literally believe these conspiracy theories . their only function is to discredit the other side by revealing some “ deeper truth ” . sure , trump tells a lot of lies but that ’s not important because it ’s a deeper truth he ’s getting at : the other side are just incredibly bad people . and when truth does n’t matter anymore , then we lose the ability to speak truth to power . and in perfect orwellian manner trump says : “ just remember , what you ’re seeing and what you ’re reading is not what ’s happening . [ … ] remember ? make america great again . and then in 2 ½ years it ’s called keep america great . ” . orwell ’s line reads : “ the party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears . it was their final , most essential command . ” 5 : hierarchy . all that remains is loyalty . trump is very clear that loyalty to him is the only guide . furthermore , on a societal level the dominant group is better than anyone else . they were the great people in the past who deserve respect just for being them . everyone else is the out-group who are violent , criminal and lazy . see the next points . 6 : victimhood . in fascism the dominant group are the greatest victims . who are they victims of ? they are victims of the out-group who are criminals . what kind of criminals are they ? they are rapists ! sexual anxiety . americans are the greatest victims of immigrants , whites are the greatest victims of blacks , germans are the greatest victims of jews . 7 : law and order . jeff sessions in november 2016 praised trumps 1989 comments about the african american suspects in the central park jogger case who were charged with having committed a terrible rape . even after their innocence was proved trump did n’t back down and continued to attack them . sessions said because of this we could tell that trump will be a law and order president . so , law and order does n’t mean punishing the guilty but rather that out-group ( black ) men are violations of law and order by their very nature . 8 : sodom and gomorrah . the real values come from the rural areas . see mein kampf : chapter one is about hitler ’s time in his birthplace braunau am inn which he describes as a perfect world of rural values “ suffused with german nationalist pride and industrious , hardworking people ” . the second chapter is about his time in vienna . and in vienna all sorts of foreigners are mixing together and there are jews everywhere . who allegedly lives in american inner cities ? african americans , the us ’ biggest out-group . i do n’t mean to say that the us has become a fascist state under trump . some of these features have always been part of us culture and politics and most importantly the country is still a multiparty democracy with roughly functioning institutions and rights and liberties for most people . but that does n’t mean that we should n’t be concerned about these similarities . cmv please convince me that i ’m unnecessarily panicking .","also , you must choose the criteria of fascism independently of trump otherwise you 're just going on a fishing expedition . it 's easy to find a few good matches but ignore all the ones that do n't match . perhaps list everything from the wikipedia page in bullet form , then use that list , not one you applied any subjective editing to . 1 : it 's incredibly narrow-minded to think the only thing the usa had in the past was an ethnically homogeneous society . economy , education , science , technology , and especially opportunity made great strides here throughout the 20th century . antifa and similar extremists today genuinely believe that the american flag is a fascist ( read : nazi ) symbol . the socialist workers party , a self-described marxist organization , was on display in london 's protests against trump visiting the uk . for a recent example , eric clanton , former philosophy professor , was charged with felony assault in a violent attack at a rally . recently he made a pledge of up to $ 500 million for the benefit of "" challenges facing migrants . "" he also donates to moveon which has been involved in political activism , recently in a partnership with unite for justice which was a prominent force during the kavanaugh protests . oppression ( implied victimhood ) is a bedrock of feminist theory and also the concept of the "" progressive stack "" . 8 : it is a fact that rural culture is typically different from urban culture . i 'm not sure why you keep citing african americans on these points , since the arguments for trump being a fascist ( not specifically in your post but in typical arguments and articles across the web ) mostly hinges on his statements and actions on immigration and latinos . in contrast he has made very few statements of african americans , either in his campaign rallies or during his presidency . state 's rights was briefly embraced as a way to push back against the civil rights movement . each and every subject is normalized as an operating "" cell "" of the greater society , which is represented by the fascist dictatorial agent . the defining quality of fascism is n't the presence of a dictator but rather the absence of the individual . often capitalized : a political philosophy , movement , or regime ( such as that of the fascisti ) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader , severe economic and social regimentation , and forcible suppression of opposition . i do n't know what people mean when they say trump is a threat to democracy . are they saying he 's going do away with the constitution and then him and some cronies are going to somehow rule the most well connected and well armed citizenry in history ? this is ridiculous , just imagine being a top military general and trump comes to you and says he needs your support in forming a dictatorship . the other scenario is that trump 's coalition would not be a small group of generals and bureaucrats but tens of millions of people who have been persuaded by him . that 's actually not a dictatorship that 's too large a group of people to purchase their loyalty the same way dictators typically buy loyalty . calling trump a fascist is nothing more than hyperbole coming from the people who are actually reprehensible . trump has also never openly supported any form of eugenics or ethnic purity which i would argue are two of the most integral elements of facism which sets it apart from other political structures . trump shares a lot of qualities with fascist leaders , but i think he lacks any True ideology . fascism 's definition is usually unclear , but i think fascist leaders generally have some ideology that they care about even if its backwards and draconian . trump ca n't have an ideology because thinking of any ideas at all is exhausting to him . fascism has a common root of practices that trump and conservatism is strictly against . lots to unpack here , lets see if we can hit it all lightly and then work from there on details as needed . the guy is far more close to a classical liberal than an evangelical in relation to social standing . his goals are to bring business and industry back to america . regulations and corporate tax has pushed business overseas , so he made changes to combat them . trump wants to put american citizens quality of life first , so of course he would oppose open borders . with the rise of opinion based reporting and the overwhelming left wing bias present in journalism as an industry , there simply is more negative press generated against conservative positions than there are liberal ones . this is of course made worse when reporters pick up stories from other outlets and report it as "" according to x : y "" . this corroboration is exactly the kind of tactic that makes opinion based reporting toxic as you 're now citing an opinion as evidence . one can certainly criticize trump for his cabinet appointments and rhetoric , but none of it rings as fascist in nature . for the most part it 's actually just hyperbole as he tends to have a bit of troll type personality . he tweets a lot of things just to provoke people to react and feed his ego . in some places it 's so bad that professors have been caught on film rioting alongside the students they preach to . it 's wrong to conflate trump 's tactics with his understanding of reality . trump speaks in hyperbole and riles up crowds not because of some deeper understanding or a conspiracy theory , but because he 's spent his life in the public spotlight . trump is a man with an ego and a lot of ambition , but he 's displayed zero fascist tendencies in regards to distorting reality . trump wants loyalty for the same reason anyone wants loyalty , he 's been attacked and undermined for the past 3 years by his own staff at regular intervals . trump 's message was to the working class , against the elites , do n't be fooled by all the anti-white sentiment . the working class has seen wage increases and new jobs under trump regardless of race and gender because he was running on an economic anti-elite platform , not a racist platform . if the anti-black sentiment you 're proposing was True , then why , in a similar case in the very same year , did trump visit a black victim of a rape and attempted murder in the hospital and offer to pay her medical expenses without any provocation . it would be fair to say that trump was not racially motivated in this case considering that his defense even in 02 was that they had prior histories and were n't good people to begin with . trump appeals to the hard working people of america , primarily the working class . it 's not a racism issue for the vast majority of republicans , and when it is , it 's usually because they see that black people disproportionately vote for democrats regardless of the effects that actually has to their quality of life . you 'll find that those democratic run inner cities often contain higher rates of poverty and crime than comparative cities . overall , i 'd say the only concern that really has merit regarding trump is the normalization of hyperbolic discussion . fascism , like socialism , is often a term so maligned as to be utterly useless in any meaningful discussion ."
9v4k1f,"there is no inequality problem in the us an expansive topic , difficult to describe it all . below is a list of reasons i ' ve","i earn less than half of the median household income . the inequality in income from my profession which is systemically controlled by the government forces me out of the community in which i serve . in addition , the quality of work i produce is lessened ; i 'm less incentivzed to be the best teacher i can be . the income inequality also drives potential teachers away from the field , thus lowering the talent pool of teachers . unfortunately , the data on happiness indicates that there is a problem with inequality . here are two papers that demonstrate two things quite clearly : ( 1 ) money buys happiness , and ( 2 ) the amount of happiness that money buys declines precipitously above an income threshold of about $ 70,000 per year . in other words , the money that is concentrated in the hands of the rich does n't make them nearly as happy as the poor would be if the money were redistributed to them . when people look for objective measures of quality of life , one of the go-to measures is infant mortality . here 's the thought : literally everyone wants babies to live , so if for some reason babies are n't able to keep living , we have certainly identified a problem . so , while i care about the happiness findings and i think the happiness findings counter your argument rather nicely , i understand the subjectivity involved and i understand if you do n't find it persuasive . more and better income and happiness data : it turns out that there 's also quite a bit of data that shows that , as inequality increases , happiness decreases . ( source 1 , source 2 , source 3 ) this does a good job of demonstrating that you ca n't just treat "" raw consumption "" as a proxy variable for happiness . second , overall consumption , much like our measures of inflation , are confounded , in my view , by increased efficiency and productivity in some sectors . so , when considering inequality , i think more weight should be given to health care , tuition , and housing costs -- because they are n't as subject to increases in efficiency . on a completely different note -- yes , nobody thinks that people getting wealthy because they work at google or whatever is bad . essentially , it means that there 's a small set of people with the skills necessary to succeed in changing economy , while more and more , everyone else is falling behind , being replaced by automation , etc . much of this income does n't get spent , because people in that demographic are prudent about saving and worried about retirement . tldr , i do n't see how you can say there 's no inequality problem when the median income has fallen way behind necessary services . sure , if you 're talking about buying an x box or a washer , the poor have n't gotten poorer , but if it 's a house or surgery , they absolutely have . i want a society that gives people money based on working rather than owning , this is not our society , so i believe inequality is a problem . henry george proposed a land value tax that would solve the problem of people making money simply by owning property that appreciates without actually doing anything to raise the value of the property . this is to say , i do n't find anything in your fifth point that actually argues against inequality being a problem ."

also in case no one else mentioned this , in many states convicted felons do not have the right to vote . suffering is something people choose , even if pain is not . even if anger wo n't do any good , people will still get angry and they are free to do so . i am free on the other hand to observe my own anger and rest in quiet awareness instead of clinging to it . you can write an op-ed , you can call your representative , you can strike , you can protest , you can do all kinds of things to make your voice heard . people can choose which ones are most worth their effort and which ones they feel are complete wastes of time . some people think voting itself is a waste of time . so just because someone felt that voting was a waste of time for themselves does n't mean they ca n't be vocally angry about the result they completely expected ( and did n't expect to change with their vote ) . fwiw - the other line you often year along with "" every vote counts "" is "" do n't waste your vote on a third party "" . we 'd love to have real candidates who cared about the people , but we 're really picking a corporate spokesperson . the truth of the matter is that voting is slacktivism ; mathematically voting makes a neglible difference — people vote because they want to have the feeling they contributed to change . but your vote does n't matter because every single candidate is a virulent racist who hates you for the color of your skin . i voted , but it was the lesser of two evils in my mind . normally , i do n't vote , because i refuse to vote for the lesser of two evils and i believe that is a valid way to express yourself . see , low voter turnout from the entire population ( let 's say 10 % ) speaks to the apathy/ambivalence of the people for the choices they are being given . it communicates that the populace of that region do not feel as though their votes actually mean something . it communicates that the ' democracy ' that this population belongs to potentially thinks their government is a sham . in the past , american analysts have pointed to lack of voting behavior in other countries as evidence of them being a sham or a highly corrupted democracy and i do n't necessarily disagree with them . for my part , i think both major parties in america are incredibly corrupt and are ultimately vying for absolute control . i would prefer a direct democracy were the people directly vote on all legislation ( with checks and balances coming from a strong constitution and judicial review ) . i would and often do vote on initiatives and laws when i am given the chance . it is possible to believe that both choices are so bad that selecting one is a betrayal of ones core beliefs . an extreme example which is in no way equal but shows what i mean would be forcing someone to choose which of their children gets to live then saying they have no right to complain if they ca n't bring themselves to choose one . to many people the state of politics and the blatant willingness of politicians to turn the citizens against eachother to maintain power makes it extremely unpalatable to support anyone taking part in the two main parties , without any real options outside of the democrats and republicans there is no way for them to vote without supporting individuals they find to be reprehensible . i do n't think that refusing to select one of two horrendous choices takes away your right to be upset at the state of things . i agree for the most part , i think a throwaway write in vote even carries a little weight because atleast a choice was shown . simply not voting gets lost in the sea of "" no one knows why they didnt "" and no point really gets made . neither people are pretty much just angry no matter who wins and can certainly be angry that certain views werent considered by either candidates , its not the same anger as someone who had a clear candidates vote being angry , but its still a relevant anger to some degree that can reveal vital info for candidates who want to capture a larger audience in future . i had one election i really didnt care of either people so i wrote in mickey mouse to atleast voice my opinions that both choices kinda sucked . but yeah if i didnt lift a finger to vote against someone making terrible decisions i definitely cant exhibit the same kind of complaints or anger as someone who did riddle me this batman : what if the individual responsible for certifying elections in your state is also running for governor ? what uf it 's a competitive overall election but it 's tge president and your state is not up for grabs ?"
9v2u2w,"a theologically-sound christian ca n't be pro-choice without contradicting their beliefs & #x200b ; & #x200b ; generally speaking , i do n't believe you should legislate morality . for example : you want to have a same-sex marriage ? i see no issue . we do n't go to every straight wedding and make sure they 're going to have a good godly marriage first . we do n't outlaw people from getting their 6th marriage after divorcing their previous spouses over and over . ( something that 's not exactly biblically sound ) , so it 's hypocritical to try to stop same-sex marriages just because it does n't fit our biblical image of marriage . abortion - however , is a whole different animal . we 're dealing with whether or not we want to define a medical procedure as murder . i 'm fine with letting people live how they want regardless of the "" purity "" of it . i ca n't hold other people to my standard of morality , that 's pointless and irrational imo . but abortion is n't limited to someone doing what they want with their body . abortion is a decision to do what they want with their body - by doing something to someone else 's body without their consent ( the unborn baby ) . & #x200b ; ultimately , the only way it seems sensible to justify abortion in my opinion is if we acknowledge the possibility that it might count as a human life - and taking that into account - we make a decision . we might decide that the life , well-being , or convenience of the mother is more important . we might decide that the baby 's future looks grim , and so it is a mercy killing . either way , we acknowledge the possibility that it might be classifiable as human - and equally alive as an adult . & #x200b ; one of the most basic beliefs of christianity is that murder is wrong ( war is a gray area that may or may not fall under that definition of ' murder ' ) . there is a belief that human life is extremely valuable and that god has an intimate involvement in each person 's birth ( "" ... you knit me in the womb ... "" ) and sees each human being as priceless . therefore , to be pro-choice is to go back on this belief and say that we should permit citizens to commit what is essentially - murder - and is therefore not theologically sound . we can not legislate purity , but we should advocate for legislation that protects life . & #x200b ; on the other hand , i 've seen a lot of people i have respect for as christians who are pro-choice . so what 's your perspective ?","murder is specifically the unjustified and unlawful killing of another human . neither is killing in self defense , killing in defense of another , or killing as a function of a legally issued execution . the biblical case for personhood starting at birth ( rather than conception ) is strong , and the biblical case for personhood starting at conception ( rather than birth ) is nearly nonexistent . \ - a miscarriage was never ' counted ' as a dead child anywhere in the bible . \ - accidental abortion is mentioned in one case , but is commanded by god to be treated as a property crime , not a case of manslaughter or murder , as long as the mother is unharmed . obviously , as you pointed out in the op , you ca n't say : "" abortion is murder , the bible prohibits murder , therefore the bible prohibits abortion , "" because that 's committing the fallacy of petitio principii . if one is a "" theologically-sound christian "" and is not pro-choice does that mean , in your view , they can not vote for a pro-choice political candidate ? every sensible person thinks murder is wrong , is n’t the question over the boundaries of what a person is and when they begin to exist ? you would think if inducing miscarriage was a mortal sin , jesus or one of the patriarchs would tell us so , especially because the use of medicine to induce miscarriage has been a common and widespread practice since the origin of medicine . as a theologically-sound christian , it is n't your job to judge others and prevent them from committing sins . so as a theologically-sound christian , you can certainly refuse to get an abortion yourself because you consider it to be a sin , but if someone else wants to commit a sin , that 's between them and god and is none of your business . first , theologically sound christians might come to different conclusions about whether abortion is murder ( which i 'm going to use to mean "" immoral killing "" ) . you make it sound like you think there is an easy to determine correct christian theology , and people either accept or reject it . in reality , christian theology ( and that of other religions as well ) is complex , and there are different reasonable interpretations of the bible . second , i 'm not sure the abortion question is actually about whether abortion is immoral killing . i do n't think you should be required to donate a kidney if you 're the only available donor , even though donating there is definitely the morally correct option . hell , i do n't even think you should be required to donate a kidney if you 're the only available donor for someone who you kidnapped and forcibly removed the kidneys from , although i 'd feel less bad about that one ( and you should obviously face charges for that , whether or not you donate a kidney to "" fix "" what you did ) . i would support mandatory registration as an organ donor long before i would support outlawing abortion , because that 's after you 're dead so you 're not using your body anymore , but i do n't think that mandatory organ donor registration is a good idea either . what if it 's just not a human life ? if this position is not particularly denounced by scripture , then what is inconsistent about a christian thinking they 're not a person , meaning it 's not murder , meaning it 's not wrong ? the reality is that most pro-choice people do not consider abortion murder . no one defends abortion because murder is cool , but because they do n't consider it murder . when you say that the unborn baby is a human and that abortion is an attack on it 's body without it 's consent , that 's not a biblical argument , but a secular one . is it murder to evict a person from inside your womb , that you never wanted to be there , if they die otherwise ? for example , in christianity adultery is a sin just like murder is , so must a christian advocate for legislation that makes adultery illegal ? another question : christianity does n't require that christians impose their beliefs and customs on non-christians , so why ca n't someone be a christian and pro-life ? basically , a woman suspected of cheating is given noxious fluid ( bitter water ) to drink , and if this induces an abortion - this is then proof that she cheated . "" when she is made to drink the water that brings a curse and causes bitter suffering , it will enter her , her abdomen will swell and her womb will miscarry , and she will become a curse . "" in light of this it 's tough to argue that bible views abortion as any kind of a murder equivalent ."
9v08mi,"private gun ownership is useless against government tyranny i will freely admit to being a liberal in favor of gun control . but my fiancé is a single issue voter about gun rights . gun rights outrank every other issue to him and his friends , and i 'd like to understand where they come from before we marry . i asked them why private gun ownership ranks so highly in importance to them , and they all said it 's because an armed population will be able to overthrow a tyrannical government if it becomes necessary . they also cared about self-defense , but overthrowing a tyrannical government was the main reason . they cite the revolutionary war as an example . in my view , a modern armed population will never be able to win against the current us military . civilians do n't have apache helicopters . almost everyone i know ca n't run 5 miles straight . at best , it 'd be years of bloody civil war like syria 's and they still would n't win . as the years go by , military technology will only continue to outpace the tech available to civilians and this rationale will become more and more far-fetched . i just do n't see how private gun ownership would allow us to overthrow the government at any point in the future . the whole argument seems like a theoretical exercise that should n't be the foremost political issue to anyone . i hope to understand opposing viewpoints .","the sheer number of people that have firearms , even if they are n't as effective as a military 's , is a huge deterrent for tyranny to take hold . do n't give up your fighting chance even when you are at a disadvantage . you get the point ; the u.s. military is the largest , most well-equipped , best trained fighting force in the history of humanity by far . it is n't even close . nevertheless , those forces all defeated the u.s. military with asymmetrical warfare . in that world , the advantage goes to the nimble force that can appear out of nowhere , and vanish into thin air . also , the military wo n't universally turn against the rebels . as we saw in iraq and syria with isis , the military will suffer from either full-on defection , or from losing equipment in raids . but , as we saw in all of our failures in the past century , the small arms ( ar-15s , hunting rifles , etc ) were necessary to trigger defections , conduct raids to seize equipment , and the like . the privately-owned weapons allow for a "" first strike "" takeover of symbolic government buildings ( capitol buildings , governors ' mansions , small national guard posts , etc ) , which then can snowball . generally speaking a professional army does n't lose against an unorganized civilian force . the continental army would 've almost certainly lost against the british if it was n't for the french army and navy helping them . if the government becomes tyrannical , would you rather have guns and make a stand or not have guns and surrender ? the policy and procedure in place is based on worst case scenarios . i do not believe dismissing the right to bear arms because it would be useless or i 've even heard the argument that it could n't happen here ( tyrannical government ) in the states . the importance of gun ownership ( if you choose to ) is based on an understanding that the worst case scenario , no matter the likelihood , is a right , acknowledged by government , not given , acknowledged , to keep government in check . i have no doubt in my mind that the founding fathers of this country , wrote this specific piece of acknowledgement , understanding worst case scenarios of a tyrannical government , foreign or domestic and the worst scenarios of an individuals right to life and your individual right to bear arms , is for you to decide , not the government 's . i reside in california , we have some of the most ridiculous pieces of legislation on guns that affect no one but it 's law abiding citizens . even if armed and motivated , i 'm not clear on what or who this armed revolution would attack . perhaps the belief is n't that having a gun means they can lead a citizens rebellion against the government , and more so means they can protect themselves personally from threatened violence against them personally by an overreaching government ? it will be states vs states and civilians vs civilians . if the federal government comes to tyranny then states will group up . seizing weapons is a must when a tyrannical force comes into power . i am personally in favor of gun control myself but i talk to these people enough that they changed my view a couple of times . the people that the american army and military fought in these two wars were indeed small militia groups . small armed militia groups do not fight like the military , they will adopt different tactics that allow them to attack ( hit ) and retreat ( run ) into the populace , i do n't like to say guerrilla tactics but yes they will be considered guerrilla tactics . they might score large victories against the military while escaping with only a few scratches . especially since the military will eventually say enough is enough and a certain amount of civilian casualties will start occurring just as they did in vietnam and the me . once that happens , these militias will start fighting dirty and by dirty i mean they may start taking civilians as hostages . so the question is really , is your fiance the type of person who would start taking hostages when his militiamen are facing hard times in their uphill war against the military ? if you think that the citizens of the u.s. would be useless in fighting the military with guns ( not True ) , then why would you lessen their chances further by taking away all their guns ? the type of government that would turn it 's military , including their apache helicopters , against it 's citizens is the exact reason the 2nd amendment was created . you 're also assuming that members of the military would only be on the governments side . turning weapons on us citizens would be unlawful and most of the military would not fire upon us citizens . this briefing is unclassified : gun control advocates and military tactics utilizing almost any offensive aircraft or land vehicle is extremely risky in a city . you assume that technological advancements like helicopters and tanks are only able to be destroyed or countered by similar tech . you assume the revolutionaries would randomly meet the government out in the field to fight fair . liberal gun ownership means you support more access and easier opportunity to owning guns . conservative gun ownership means support limiting who can own guns . i 'd like to specifically address the idea that military tech will outpace civilian available tech , as others have already covered insurgency tactics . if private citizens can keep up with changing automobile standards , they can certainly keep up with firearm standards , which change about an order of magnitude slower . in a civil war , bombing our own population would n't be a great option . even if you lose the civil war , a civil war against armed civilians is worse then a civil war against unarmed civilians . a tyrannical government has to be slightly less tyrannical then the population is armed . in the us there is about 1 private gun per person . now imagine that civilian resistance is either has a bunch of guns or almost no guns . controlling rural american would be essentially impossible until you took their guns away ... which would thus be the first step of any attempt to control that group of people . the idea is that our country was not intended to have a standing army as we do ; and the population was mea n't to own all the weapons . during the revolutionary war , the cannons used were privately owned . we were meant to have a civilian military ready to fight at a moment 's notice . that means there would be no army to fight against on the side of the tyrannical government . unfortunately we have moved away from a militia system , which is causing the problem we have with the constitutional rights regarding guns . there is instead a militia hall in every town running more like the army reserve , where you have to train every x days . weapons not intended for hunting or simple home defense is stored in the militia hall and can only be checked out for training or situations where the militia is called on . in case the government needed overthrown , it was the job of the militia to do so . and there was no standing army to stand against , revolution was meant to be overall bloodless with the guns being the threat not the means . no more arguing about background checks because it 's part of the militia training and requirements . no one thinks civilian gun owners can win in open combat against the us military , the antityranny argument is that you can assassinate leaders . we have seen how these civilian gun owner situations play out : assassinations and terror attacks . you miss understand the way private gun ownership protects from government tyranny . the idea behind private gun ownership is the people do not need to rely on a hostile police force - which may be actively oppressing them - for protection . consider the case of the black panthers , ‘ with a law book in one hand and a shotgun in the other ’ black men in america were able to protect themselves from hostile police forces ( government tyranny ) by way of a militia formed from 2a private gun ownership . i ’m more of a moderate i want reasonable gun control like universal background check banned certain types of guns and certain attachments like fully automatic rifles , high capacity magazines , bump stocks . private gun ownership was a massive pain in the ass when trying to pacify iraq . within 24 hours , the police had unmarked weapons and the bad guys had marked ones . without the locals being willing to follow the rules , there was no way to enforce our tracking system . iraq does n’t have an address system like the dmv , not that it matters , because as soon as the conflict started , the locals began moving . trying to police the gun situation became a huge problem . finding hidden guns is a huge pain in the ass . how much time and energy can we devote to sorting legal vs illegal guns when we are after murderers , bombers , and killers ? it was just too much of a pain in the ass for little to no reward . however , having the whole population rise up at once is a fantasy . while you have many good points , the thing with revolution is that it is not a head on fight , there are ways that a people can fight that a government can not , a foreign solder ca n’t walk around a city like a civilian and not be noticed , yet this is how a rebel will hide , a man walking down the street with some explosives and pistol in his pockets wo n’t be shot on sight , and can easily destroy a transport and defend him self as he runs off . revolutionary solders army fighting because someone says to , but because they believe in the cause , they are willing to die if need be , while a government solder would be more likely to run or surrender , the revolutionary will die and take the enemy with him . military force , no matter how superior , is not able to stop a committed insurgency . maybe it 's suicidal , but you never know , the armed rebels might save you , and free the whole country from slavery . do n't take away people 's ability to defend themselves by banning gun ownership . not in favor of confiscating everyone ’s guns but if that was everyone ’s only concern , it ’s way more likely you are going to end up with a tyrant that needs overthrowing . its not necessarily that the us population with some rifles , shotguns and pistols can overthrow the might of the worlds strongest military , its that the government cant freely control the populace . its to protect against a tyrannical government , not to stand toe to toe in an all out war . modern dictatorships start with removing weapons from the general population , censoring education , controlling media , and controlling communication . the first amendment protects us from having our communication stripped and the second amendment protects us from having our weapons stripped from us . education is controlled by the local government , so its not easy to simply replace all the teachers ( as you saw with turkeys coup ) , and most media is unfortunately controlled by a few corporations which i believe should be illegal . to simplify , i am challenging you on your view that its not that an armed populace can beat the us military in all out war , but that an armed populace is enough to help prevent the rise of a tyrannical government . there 's atleast 100 million guns in the us and 2 million police and military combined . how successful do you think the police/military are going to be at taking those guns away , especially when a large number of them are private gun owners themselves and will be against it ? when the argument shifts to "" armed uprising against tyrannical govt . "" i 'd like to meet these large swaths of servicemen who will blindly massacre crowds of us citizens . that being said , he never went to iraq or afghanistan , where the military had major roe issues with the insurgency . i do n't think it could happen , and in the hypothetical event that it did , the state national guardsmen/guardswomen would definitely have something to say about it . i think that the "" i want to have a gun to protect myself from the govt . "" as someone who grew up shooting in rural areas - i prefer to not have a gun in the house . the only way this would change is if i , again , lived in a rural area and used it for hunting or protecting the property from pests/livestock predators . yes , the government has tanks and apache helicopters , but as soon as they turn those weapons on a city , that city will be against the government . look at afghanistan , regardless of the strength of the us fighting forces , there are still entire cities that stand in opposition and the only way for the us to clear them out would be by bombing the city which would kill thousands of innocent civilians . the wholesale slaughter of civilians would the government to lose support . the right to bear arms is to keep the government mindful of our rights . private gun owners in the us could also organize and create paramilitaries which could threaten the official military . while it is True that in a 1 on 1 , straight fight the us military could beat all the private gunowners who are n't in active service , it will most likely not be a 1 on 1 straight fight . turning every major city into a potential ambush , it would require massive military commitments from the official military to keep it safe . initially the rebels would only have small arms , but several raids could net them more equipment ; foreign aid from various powers could definitely complicate things . so the military occasionally mandates you to answer a question whether our troops would fire on u.s civvies if they attacked the government . the us government could not keep the us occupied with constant insurgent battles against their own from civilians on their own turf . it is enforced by boots on the ground searching homes , black-bagging persons of interest , and holding checkpoints . these are more likely to be a police force than a fully mechanized military as well , at least at first . you mention the syrian civil war which has been ongoing for years , but the estimates of their gun ownership rates before the war was only about 2 % , compared to about 40 % of us households owning guns , with more guns in the us than people by most estimates . most of the dod is not even military , it 's civilians . most of the military is not combat ratings , they 're technicians , supply specialists , and other support ratings . there are ~ 19 million veterans in the civilian population , with millions having served with the modern military over the past few decades , myself included . i think you do n't really understand how the armed forces work . they are not designed to control the population . they are far from perfect for civilian control because there are not enough of them . ... a tyrannical government 's goal would be to control the population , not to destroy it . but a tyrannical government would only target the ones who dissent . so , what is better , for the revolutionaries to have weapons and at least have a chance , or be completely defenseless against just guns ? mind that if a real revolution would occur in that case , it 's very much possible that over half of the population would rise up . and they better have guns , because a tyrannical government would not just order to kill all of them , it 's just impossible . but if the majority rises up , or at least a half or a third , at this point guns are a great help . another big thing about private gun ownership is self defense , guns save between 100,000 and 3,000,000 lives a year while gun homicide is around 30,000 a year including suicides the thing is helicopters and drones ca n’t enforce a police state . and on top of that you are n’t blowing up and destroying military installations at that point , you ’d be destroying the infrastructure of your own nation like factories , schools , prisons , stores , supplies , and food . and when you compare the armed forces to the armed population you ’re looking at 4 million troops to 80-100 million armed civilians . you forget that the u.s military is made up of u.s civilians it 's not a matter of us vs them but a matter of would the military and police be willing to step aside for a militia to overthrow a tyrannical government . the military is sworn to protect the citizens from all enemies foreign and domestic . this is a good argument for repealing the hughes amendment and legalizing other more deadly weapons for civilians . well the united states has lost wars to poorly organized but well armed guerilla forces more than once . and that was even though the us had a large , well trained , and technically sophisticated army with tanks , missiles , and helicopters . well any attempt to turn the military on americans would end badly for the government . but going back on any type of war , you fail to understand just how many military members would defect to protect american citizens . what it really comes down to , is this stance is far easier than really addressing the issue with all the school and public shootings recently . thats mental health . these kids that shoot up schools use someone close to them weapons , close to 80 % . most states have a realistic and good background checks prior to buying , and those checks wont prevent school shooters for the most part . the real issue , with our country as a whole , is lack of availability of mental health help , not to mention the social stigma if getting help . these shooters ( sans the religious based ones , but thats another topic ) are being left at home alone without the parental support ; because families are forced to have two working parents just to make ends meet or as in most cases there is single parent . also to get a professional evaluation , one that most often doesnt come with the ability to prescribe drugs if needed , can and does cost over 200 dollars . i know i went off on a tangent , but i think gun control isnt the solution everyone believes it will be . most states already have pretty thorough background checks , and even if they pass the test it wont prevent a young relative from stealing the guns and shooting up a school . so a gun ban would just force americans to pay fines or give up their weapons , neither of which will prevent crime with guns . the gangs are only able to have this much power over the people because the people are unarmed and at the time it was illegal to shoot a burglar even if he had a weapon . the mafia had influence over politicians . they would only be emboldened if they did n't fear store owners with guns . the federal government seems to be genuinely fighting them though . i have n’t read all the responses so i do n’t know if this is covered , but one major component that ’s might be left out we have been in a war for 17 years now . that has created a lot of veterans who have combat experience with firearms and tactics of the us military . i ’m sure the propaganda would be high to convince the military to fire on their former brothers and sisters in arms , and vice versa . i believe it would be much easier for them to get the military to turn on the corrupt government . it is n’t a True one issue thing , but a broad area to be concerned with . considering that all the most successful uprisings have come from gun owning citizens against an opposed government , you 're obviously wrong . gun ownership is paramount in being able to oppose a government with violence enhanced civil disobedience . without gun ownership there is no physical was , outside home made bombs , that a populace can oppose an armed government . bombs , by design , are quite indiscriminate and people that oppose tyrannical governments are not interested in the harming of the populace , just the tools of the government ... this does n't preclude bombings , but it does define the actions that violent political opposition is quantified by , by the overall populace being governed . the usa could n't exist if gun ownership was restricted . the amendment was so that citizens had equal tools to face a government supported military force ... which in today 's day and age , would require assault rifles . in the incredibly unlikely event of a civil war , it would n't be open combat between militaries , it would be guerrilla warfare . the civilian arms do n't have to be enough to completely defeat the entire military , it just has to be a big enough deterrent to ensure our government stays in line . the tragedies of kent state , ruby ridge and waco , tx produced more than a little backlash and perhaps the government is now less likely to violently conflict with its own citizens , as it looks really really really bad . what you should try to convince your boyfriend of instead , is that a huge professional military is antithetical to the idea that we want to be able to fight the government . you 're not wrong about that . get him to vote for and support candidates who will shrink the gap between the military and the citizens . setting aside the numbers issue - namely 1 million soldiers trying to continuously suppress 10 + million armed citizens , let me flip this - one could argue that freedom of speech or assembly are also outmoded and useless in the face of a tyrannical government . freedom of speech is there imo to allow us to criticize government before it becomes tyrannical . the 2nd is there for a couple of reasons , but primarily imo as a check to stop or greatly slow the concentration/abuse of power ( the fact that lots of guns are out there acts to give the governing pause when they are tempted to deny freedom of speech or assembly ) aside from that intent , all the bor are based on the idea that you ( and everyone else ) as an individual are a free person , entitled to speak , associate and defend yourself against any and all individuals/groups that seek to remove your right to self determination . a tyrannical government is one that does not operate under the consent of the governed , and must do so by force . armed citizens are going to avoid going toe to toe with the actual military in the same way that insurgents in the middle east currently do . the victory condition for an insurgency against a tyrannical government is not defeating the government in battle , it wins by causing the tyrannical government to expend so many resources dealing with the insurgency that it either gives up for lack of will , collapses in debt , or a military coup decides that they 'd rather stop being shot at by their countrymen and turns on the formal leadership . carrying guns as leverage against the government does n't have to be open warfare . so , think what ever you want about that merits of that situation , the government did n't automatically raid and enforce it 's view because they did n't want it to devolve into a shoot out . the flip side is something like waco , where the government does move in and armed conflict breaks out and people die . if the government turns and uses the full force of it 's military to enforce laws on the civilians , yeah , we 're pretty outgunned because an ak-47 wo n't stop a tank . but places like iraq and afghanistan have shown a lightly armed civilian force can be pretty effective against a large modern military . i think a lot of people here did an incredible job of explaining the 2nd amendment and the need for private gun ownership to dissuade a tyrannical government from oppressing the very people that give it power , but i think another aspect of private gun ownership is very much overlooked from the standpoint of self-defense . as was mentioned before , i think every american citizen can agree that we do not want the government overstepping its boundaries , regardless of political affiliation , but as was decided by the supreme court in d.c. vs. heller , the original intent of the 2nd amendment would include the natural right of self-preservation , and that private firearm ownership is constitutional because firearms are tools used legally for self-defense purposes . as tragic as any case involving mass shootings is , i think it is often overlooked that mass shooting events , account for barely a sliver of overall violent crimes committed . some people believe that the government can not always be there to protect ourselves and our families , so in having a privately owned firearm , you at least have a fighting chance should the unthinkable happen . it ’s more of a deterrent for the government to ever become tyrannical . also you focus a lot about the might of the us armed forces , need i remind you planes do n’t fly without fuel . your statement also assumes that the us would have a high percentage of its military force go along with engaging in active combat against a civilian population . talk to any local military vets and active duty personnel about this issue and see what they say if they were ordered to go house to house and arrest and imprison u.s. citizens . they do n't need to win an actual stand up fight . they only need to exist and cause trouble long enough for the tyrannical government to fall , due to crippling military debt , total population uprising , or concession to change . the government would not unleash total war on its population , and it is unlikely an invading force would use such measures . this means that you would end up with situations like iraq and afghanistan , where a rural , uneducated and mostly untrained force equipped with only small arms , stolen equipment and home made ieds have been able to hold their own against the most expensive and technologically advanced military the world has ever seen . our special forces , while equipped with some of the best small arms technology , mostly operate in guerilla warfare , so no tanks , destroyers and attack helicopters . as has already been said , occupations are run with troops on the ground , they are exposed and open to attack when they have to go into cities searching for targets of a resistance force . think of some of the people with the worst motivations , oklahoma city bombing , 9/11 , the july 22nd attacks , these were done by a handful of people without real training , yet were capable of dealing mass damage . those same tactics could be used by a civilian force defending their homes from a tyrannical government or invading force . you do n't need a tank or attack helicopter to fight a war . we have a highly educated and crafty population , so if the rural uneducated population of afghanistan can be victorious over western forces , i ca n't imagine the devastation a guerilla force from the states would be capable of . the point is to make the cost , financial , political , and in terms of human life , so extensive over a period of time that it forces the state into negotiating . hence the us and afghan government has been in under the table talks with the taliban for the past few years , because as the conflict has dragged on they 've realized there is never going to be peace in the country without engaging with the taliban on one level or another . the state would be forced into the position of aggressor . patriotism does n't mean much when your government is kicking in your front door , or when the national guard is checking cars on every major highway . and that 's at the lower end of the spectrum . this might not result in widespread political support for right wing militants , but it would absolutely erode public faith and trust in government to a point where any semblance of legitimacy would be out the window . that chaos , that feeling of opposition between a population and its government , is what allows armed factions to spread and insert themselves deeper into the civic life of the country . in my government class ( college ) my professor told my class that during the 2nd world war the reason japan did n't invade , and instead attacked peral harbor was becuase of the amount of fire arms the american people had . and they didnt think they would be able to get control of more than a few states . while civilian fire arms might not be quite as good comparatively to military weaponry it can still help if there is ever a risk we are invaded again . just let people have their guns as long as their registered and properly trained and vetted i.e. no mental health issues or past of having them , no felony history , etc . if private citizens are not allowed to be armed then they must rely on the government for protection from other private citizens and the government can simply choose not to protect people it does n't like . a good example of this kind of thing is what happened recently in bangladesh where pro-government private citizens began beating the student protesters and sexually assaulting women . imagine if white nationalists started doing the same thing to black lives matter protesters in our country and the us government and local police decided not to do anything . governments can also less specifically and less deliberately fail to protect private citizens simply by not providing adequate funding to police forces in certain areas . geography also presents a problem for many people in terms of relying on the government for protection , even as things currently stand . most people do n't realize that response times are around 8 to 10 minutes in a city and double that in rural areas . tl ; dr relying on the government as your sole means of protection puts you at their mercy , whether it be from their malice , ineptitude , or simply inability to get to you fast enough to help . the fatal flaw with that argument is that the rebelling side is often very untrained , has less prior access to weaponry , and often has less numbers . if a civil war were to happen in the us you have a much larger civilian population with previous firearms training , access to multiple firearms per capita , and would likely be a much larger force . for example , the number of deer hunters in the state of wisconsin last year was roughly 600,000 . you bring home field advantage into that ( a growing number of us military come from southern/southwestern states ; the us military has spent the last 20 years training primarily for desert combat ) , and it would be a very close fight imo . this is why gun advocates do n't want to be restricted to single-shot or low-capacity weapons . if you allow substantial firearm ownership for millions , that goes along way in discouraging tyranny . my only addition is that there have been successful revolutions many times throughout human history and while the united states military is extremely large , it is also extremely expensive . even if it did happen , and even if the irregulars did stand a chance , community organization and ideological coherency of the rebels would be at least as important as stockpiles of weapons . a bunch of unaffiliated private citizens with basements full of ars does not an insurgency make . however , an all-out war is not the only scenario where civilians may need weapons against the government . consider robert f. williams . he never went to war with the us military , or even shot it out with the police ( although he did fight the klan , which was effectively a paramilitary wing of the police in many parts of the south ) . however , by arming his community , he was able to build enough of a power base to protect them from police abuses . the situation for black people in nc at the time could absolutely be considered "" tyrannical "" ( i think there 's something to be said for the modern gun movement being overwhelmingly white men who have n't been in such situations , but that 's another argument ) , and by force of arms they were able to make concrete improvements to their situation . here , citizens were able to use arms to fight voter suppression , again concretely making positive political changes without a national revolution . i think most of the people who own guns currently would generally support some kinds of repressive government . regardless though , there are certainly situations where armed citizens absolutely can and have directly and effectively combat "" tyranny "" . if the 2nd amendment was actually followed as it was written and intended , the military would not have superior weapons available than the regular citizen . the point of the 2a was to allow the regular citizen access to the same technology and firepower as the government . that is why so many people are against further 2a regulations ; they have been stripped of a lot of rights already and more would just make it worse . if they just keep getting hacked away bit by bit eventually there will be no rights ; then what do you do ? it 's a deterrent for the government to become tyrannical in the first place . i personally think the biggest thing you are missing is that its not that we want to fight the us government , and the us military in the case that the government does become tyrannical , but that we want to have a way to stand our ground in the case it does happen . if your about to get in a fight , and your attack has a knife would you rather a knife of your own , or your bare hands ? if your attacker had a gun would you rather a gun of your own , or a knife , or your bare hands . we know damn well that they have tanks , and attack vehicles , but its not about being able to win , its about being able to stand our ground , and to make it as hard as possible for them to win . if the us government did become tyrannical , somehow avoiding all of the safety nets to avoid tyranny , we would fight back , and with out a doubt , aid would come . the us is one of the strongest , if not the strongest , military presences on the planet , and if that military presence was suddenly had a blood lust , there is no doubt in my mind that other military powers , big and small , would come to stop it . if this were the case , we are not there to win , but to slow the progression of the tyrannical governments push until aid arrives . tl ; dr : we know we are not stronger than the military , and that we wont easily win a war , but we need some way to hold back a tyrannical government until aid arrives . every city had a group of organized militia , who were essentially civilians playing at being an army . the army went from town to town , with each militia fleeing before it . in 2017 the military had a little over 2 million personnel . that is less than 1 soldier for every 1.6 square miles . the military could not hold ground even against a resistance armed with rocks . the military would be overwhelmed . and this is assuming that every single military member would side with the government , against his countrymen . rather than think in terms of a binary , where you have literal hitler on one side of the coin , and pure and unfettered freedom on the other , consider the "" frog in the pot "" or "" slow burn "" version of tyranny , whereby some entity hijacks the political mechanisms we have in place to gain power and then tries to force some part of their will apon the populace . hypothetical tyrannical dictator trump ( henceforth , known as "" trumptator "" ) tries to stack the supreme court with judges that will agree with whatever he does , and by executive order , he decrees himself able to serve more than two terms , and only let 's landowners vote , and twists and contorts the electoral college and state elections to ensure he can hold his seat indefinitely . let 's say that trumptator is the racist boogeyman cnn says he is and he decides to deport all brown people to the other side of the wall . since the military consists of a diverse group of people from across the spectrum of ethnicities and ideologies ( though it leans conservative and christian ) , many are not going to be comfortable following those orders . the decision to go along or abandon one 's post would have to factor in the likelihood of success of rebellion , considering how many like-minded people are in the military and how difficult the task of bringing the populace to heel . given that an individual soldier 's willingness to resist increases as the likelihood of a successful coup increases , the portion of the military in on the coup will necessarily be bigger , the better their chances . the remaining 80 % of military personnel and civilians have to decide whether to go along or fight back , with their decision being influenced by the likelihood of success . let 's say a soldier estimates that 30 % would participate in a coup ( ignoring that abt half of service men and women are minorities themselves ) . if there are 2 million people in the military , and 325 million people in the us , and more guns than people in the us , then some 1.4 million soldiers with 70 % of the us 's tanks , guns , aircraft , etc would face off either against 600k soldiers with 30 % of military tech or 600k soldier with 30 % of military tech plus maybe 50 million armed civillians ( accounting for less than half being combat ready ) . now , since soldiers with objections to the deportation policy have a lot more confidence in the coup , the number willing to participate goes up . if people did n't have guns , then it would be pretty easy for a government that wanted to to just round up everyone and march them into box cars . now instead of knocking on their door , with a couple of armed goons and hauling them off , you have to have a whole platoon of troops in case that guy decides to start shooting . the government could still probably subjugate the population , but it would just be a lot harder , more expensive , and bloody . now , if people have guns , these things are a lot easier to do and a lot harder to prevent . instead of guarding a piece of critical infrastructure with a couple of well armed soldiers , you now need several , maybe with heavy weaponry in case 20 or so guys with hunting rifles decide to show up . ultimately , this is impossible to do because of disparity in numbers . while it will not be possible for an armed populace to go toe-to-toe with a modern military , it would always be possible for them to temporarily achieve superior force somewhere and then disappear into the woodwork before they are destroyed by a full on military response . an armed populace just requires a ton of money and effort to fight against , even for a technically sophisticated military . this is why we have spent $ 900b on a war in afghanistan , where troops have no moral conflicts about killing fellow citizens , and have come away with nothing , while pol pot was able to round up and kill a couple million unarmed people with the budget of a 3rd world country . i 'd argue from a different perspective , that being : given that the united states has the highest rate of guns per capita , it 'd be extremely difficult for an opposing country to invade our land . while far from every person owns a firearm , it could be fair to assume that gun owners could distribute their personal arsenal with their non-gun-owning neighbors/communities should an invasion loom . you could argue that citizens could be wiped out with bombs and long-range missiles , however , if a country truly wanted to take over the u.s. , they would need boots on the ground . with this consideration , i 'd argue that it 'd be extremely difficult to invade the united states if the entire inhabiting population were armed in addition to the military that is also defending the country . what if the tyrannical government is not our own , but is instead a tyranny attempting to invade our country ? if this is the case , private gun ownership would in fact , help us in defending from invading tyrannical forces . besides the fact that our government is more prone to an internal takeover , and some would argue that this has already taken place , the military is less that 1 % of the entire population . at some point it would n't matter what weapons they used , the sheer force of armed citizens would have the upper hand rather quickly . however , the public would never unite to commit to such an act . the last aspect would be if the us government decided to commit atrocities to its own citizens in a khmer rouge style political take over , the people need to be armed or they will just end up in a mass grave . the members of the armed forces are not different , neither are the police . now let ’s imagine that the government actually does become tyrannical . would you sign up to help them ( military or police ) if you knew there would be bullets coming from the people you are supposed to be controlling ? the government might win eventually ( if it was willing to go far enough ) but the people who choose to own firearms are not only going to slow the government down , but they will also dissuade the people who would replace them . that is exactly the point of an armed populace . they would n't win a standard shooting war , but would easily win a drawn-out guerrilla war . by win in the guerrilla war , i mean that in the terms of a guerilla war . the second amendment allows me to continue to serve that oath even though someday i will take off the uniform i wear . most of the us militaries heavy weapons would not work well at all against american guerilla fighters . many of the exact type of people with your husband 's idealogy are in the military , government and law enforcement agencies . a relatively small amount of farmers was able to overthrow one of the mightiest militaries of the time . here is something i was thinking about recently . this does n't necessarily speak for "" overthrowing "" the government but it might be worth thinking about when arguing for or against gun ownership : imagine there was wide spread gun ownership in nazi germany . but still , if that happened , it would mean that on a larger scale it would have prevented a world war at the time and at least might have saved the rest of europe a whole lot of trouble . after going through a period of civil war , the country might not have had the capacity anymore to bring war to a larger scale , which would have been an improvement over what actually happened . in the past 100 years of american history the only groups that could defeat the united states military were groups of guerilla fighters with small arms . cite afghanistan and vietnam , look at how well american fighters fought the germans compared to the japanese with their guerilla tactics . might i also add that the colonists defeated the forces of the largest empire in human history . in the unlikely event of america being overthrown or becoming tyrannical it 's better to have the ability to resist than simply saying "" oh well there is no chance of freedom the government is too well armed . "" i believe that this argument forgets one crucial element of the event of a militia being risen against the government ; although the days are not that in which soldiers and civilians had the same old brown bess , we are not too far off . the semi-automatic ar platform is quite military grade , most soldiers with automatic variants choosing to keep them on semi or burst ( the modes available on civilian models ) as they offer greater control , ammo usage , and accuracy . ultimately , the militia of the us is made of all civilians and soldiers that would choose to leave . many gun owners are also ex military , and as such would have high skill with firearms . however looking at vietnam , and afghanistan it ’s clear that a heavily armed civilian population can definitely hurt a “ professional ” army and i would say that americans are not only better armed then the viet cong and taliban ( or whatever other islamic militant group you want to name ) but more skilled with their weapons . when it comes to tanks and aircraft there are hundreds of not thousands of fully stocked armories manned by minimal service personnel across the us that would be easily over run by civilians . if your argument is "" the people cant compete with the military because the military has better weapons "" than you have missed the point of the second ammendment . there really arent many handheld weapons that the military has that civillians dont . people who use the fight against tyranny argument are n't saying that they 'll be able to fight the us military in a conventional war . it 's about having the ability to fight a guerilla war , which is much harder to do with no guns . the soldiers are a lot harder to kill than in the days of vietnam , but it 's still plausible compared to trying to fight a conventional war with civilian grade weapons . i think the point is not that a militia of private gun owners would win the revolution , but that it 's an option at all . i have concerns over gun ownership , but certainly it 'd be easier for a population with access to firearms to revolt than a population without , and america 's basis has always been freedom ( for better or for worse ) . the argument that the military would never go against the civilian population is a little misleading . some members of the military would never use their weapons against some of the civilian population . i 've heard a lot of people in the military talk about deploying to chicago to shoot at gang members . military members are n't likely to attack their own communities , but a lot of them would be willing to go into communities that are not their own . see the difference in police conduct to the bundy ranch standoff ( armed ) vs the furgeson black lives matter protests ( unarmed ) . one group got the tear gas / beanbag round / baton treatment ( unarmed ) and the other got an extended negotiation that resulted in no fatalities or legal action . ( note : i 'm talking about the initial standoff , not round 2 where a guy was killed after an encounter with police afterward ) . this does n't necessarily address the "" overthrow "" piece , but there are n't too many recent examples where the clearly stated objective of the rebel group was to flat-out overthrow the government , rather than pressure a regime change or for the leader to step down . the guns are n't meant to directly overthrow the government or defeat the military . obviously , the army can easily defend its bases and major administrative centers against a mob armed with rifles . let 's say , for example , that us government decided to change the constitution , start drafting everybody for a war overseas or do anything like that that would anger a large portion of the population . the government has only two ways then : admit defeat and stand down , or try to silence people with force and get them back to their jobs . the only force that can stop hundreds of thousands of people with rifles is , as you said , army with tanks , helicopters and bombs , which means mass murder and a large scale civil war that will drag on for decades and cause economical crisis that will weaken the country against foreign influence . because of how large us is and how many guns are owned by civilians , it will be impossible to suppress all the militant groups , and i would say even to control small cities . so if the government wanted to go that way , it would spend a lot of resources on fighting its own population , lose control of the rural areas and even some urban centers , have to deal with horrified and desperate population , constant attacks on its army and police force , economic crisis and risk a military coup or a foreign invasion ( i doubt russia and china would miss their chance to support the ensuing chaos , just like in ukraine ) . yes , the us military would wipe the floor with the resistance if they took to the field , but irregular units packing the kind of firepower in civilian arsenals , combined with good tactics , improvised explosives , and the support of locals , can cause absolute mayhem to an occupying force . gun ownership is your right as a human being to freely contract with another human being . gun control is about the state making money in various ways . the state makes money by issuing permits , and imprisoning people for free labor . gun control does not prevent killings no matter what any data says . gun control permits more people to die , because only the law abiding citizens will be vulnerable to law-breaking citizens at the end of a barrel . look at the inner cities with the strictest gun control , high murder rate by guns . gun ownership is not about just defending yourself from government tyranny but all tyranny . the major military advances you mentioned are designed to destroy other military weapons . however consider the middle east right now and the conflicts there . the insurgents commonly use 30 + year old weapons and drive 30 + year old toyota trucks yet they stand a chance against the worlds most advanced military forces . the reason is certainly not their technology ; it ’s the fact that they are well armed ( in number ) in addition to their knowledge of the terrain . altitude and terrain aside , it is difficult to secure and police a militant state full of armed insurgents . so difficult that widespread gun ownership is a disincentive to forces domestic and abroad from even attempting to invade or install a tyrannical government/force . the widespread gun ownership disincentivized sane people from doing insane things and in its own way kept the peace without a strong law enforcement presence . an unarmed populace not only relies on its government for personal and community security ( we all know governments can go sour ) but it also reduces the risk and cost of installing tyranny or invading with tyrannical forces . it 's not about the population ' winning ' a war but rather about making the prospects of armed conflict with the population not worth the trouble . for example , imagine if you were a corrupt member of the military police tasked with raiding and oppressing a minority group of your country . now imagine if there was a high likelihood that when you raid a home they have weapons that could easily kill you and your group . you might have strong reservations raiding that home if there 's a good chance they have a militarily competitive weapon . you ca n't call apache helicopters on every home you have to deal with because that level of destruction would be unsustainable on your own country 's / military 's infrastructure . when jews and armenians were oppressed during their genocides , it was door-to-door rounding up , not military battles.y you ca n't police a people with missiles , nukes , or helicopters ; it usually comes down to door-to-door interactions and small arms conflicts . the kinds of conflict you describe in you post is more of the kind that countries have with other countries , where as most modern conflict is a coalition versus a small militant group . like in vietnam for example , the us had nukes , helicopters , and all kinds of technological and military advantages over the vietcong . the vietcong almost exclusively used small arms and very little artillery to wait out and repel the strongest military in the world . the point of private gun ownership in modern days is not to fight the military . a country with no private gun ownership can easily be subjected to tyranny without the government firing a single shot . in a country where private gun ownership exists , in order for the government to impose tyranny , they must be willing to use their massively overpowered military against its people , which is much more difficult , both logistically and as far as global public image goes . i am a gun owner with multiple firearms , am a staunch second amendment supporter , and never really once considered the possibility of doing battle against the military . a government is obviously less inclined to become tyrannical against armed citizens than it is against unarmed citizens . a military officer asks for everyone in a town to bring their weapons to fight an invader . rather than have an arsenal left decrepit you can have a weapon for everyone that they know how it operate and care for to repel a force . an armed populace also has the same effect as nuclear weapons . the reason that gun rights are so important is because they serve as a massive check on the government at large . a civilian can not beat a tank , but how many service members will be okay with shooting at american citizens , especially ones who are shooting back ? it sounds to me like you are suggesting that because you think private gun owners ca n’t accomplish what they say they want/need the right for they should no longer have it . everyone always forgets that the us military is made up of human beings who also ( for the most part ) believe that the second amendment is necessary , and would have a very hard time deciding between literally killing other us citizens for a tyrannical government , or turning against that very government , thus fighting alongside the armed citizenry . see literally every war the us has been involved in with since korea , it 's our giant military against small arms wielding locals , and we traditionally did n't fare well , iraq , afghanistan , vietnam etc etc . "" because an armed population will be able to overthrow a tyrannical government if it becomes necessary . "" still "" government "" but certainly not able to overtake any significant armed force . if govt uses all their bombs/missles/etc then they will only be ruling over a pile of ash , so its really not an option . they would have to destroy their own state to rule it , so basically the only way to get by is to take out individual enemies no ? also , many people in the military would desert , bringing advanced weapon systems , vehicles , and tactical knowledge to the insurgency . others would stay in and inform the insurgents of every move the military makes . i do n't want to spark a huge argument over limits of the second amendment , but in that time , private citizens could own cannons , which would be roughly equivalent to an m1 abrams tank based on how weapons have advance . the militia acts of 1792 also state that a militia can be called upon as members of the national military , implying that they will be armed the same . guerrilla tactics are essential to a conflict like that and would be similar against some sort of tyrannical government . the constitution accounted for cannons to be included in the second amendment , considering it 's a military weapon . so by having an armed citizenry using popular weapons , massachusetts could call up a militia and it would n't be a bunch of old fudd 's showing up with mismatched shotguns , .22 pistols and other rusted-ass nonsense . also , 100 million people with guns makes for a hard target to take over in a land war . i single person with a gun is nothing compared to the full force of the us armed forces , but him and his neighbor and joe down the street and lucy is apartment 2a and the 270 million other people that own guns in america could win a civil war . i am pretty damn sure that the men and women that currently work in the us armed forces would not fight the people they signed up to protect . this argument generally comes from a lack of understanding about how different types of wars are fought and what the functions of various military technologies are . the most common iteration of this is something along the lines of "" guns are useless in fighting government because something something drones ! "" now , it 's obvious enough that drones , helicopters , and f-35s would destroy small arms in a head to head fight , but that 's an overly simplistic way of looking at things . no one could defeat the roman legions in an open field , with their vastly superior weaponry , but the germanic tribes , crushed varus in teutoburg , largely due to guerilla tactics and ongoing revolts in the balkans that spread the roman legions thin . in the same sense that the roman legions were designed to destroy other armies but were ill equipped to handle widespread revolt , much of the u.s. military is designed to take out critical military targets like planes , tanks , and missile silos ... but not an armed population . in the unlikely event of the entire military siding with the government , military personnel have families that can be taken hostage if the situation was desperate enough for the insurgents . i did not write this but this explanation to why gun rights are so important to so many people struck a cord in me . the right to keep and bear arms , to me , is not about pistols or rifles or shotguns or even artillery pieces . a free man does not need to fear the creatures of the world , his neighbor , a police officer , the state , or war . ultimately , any agreement or contract is backed by the threat of some kind of force . being allowed the ability to resist , yet choosing not to because you believe in the process is part of how you know you are free . if the state holds weapons and the citizens do not , then it is no longer an agreement between equals . perhaps a well treated slave with lots of privileges ( so long as you do as you are told ) , but since you are not given the option to resist you are a slave none the less . so to me , the right to keep an bear arms says that i am an equal participant in our society . i am a free man who chooses to follow these laws and abide these restrictions . i may not always get my way , other people will vote differently , but regardless i am an equal member of that society and i chose of my own free will to participate in it 's process . a free man may own a weapon . he has the ability to resist , but chooses not to because he is equal .

9uyal6,voting data that segments the voters by gender/race should not be made public . i have seen a lot of posts this week about how white women voted a particular way or how black men vote a certain way . are n’t people more than just the color of their skin and their gender ? releasing such data does not do justice to the multitude of reasons as to why people vote either way . it belittles people and brings them down to the color of their skin or their gender or sexual orientation . the conversation that stems from this data is nothing short of divisive and can be avoided as it only represents entire segments of the population in a very one dimensional view and people are anything but one dimensional .,"more so than it was 60 years ago in many cases . this means that the experiences of people of different skin colors can be very different . regardless of which of these buckets you fall into , your experiences and familiarity with people in different buckets is always going to be limited . we do n't want to live in a society where data is hidden even for supposed "" greater good . "" if you feel that some type of data is irrelevant , then speak up , and explain to people why that data is not relevant . your argument here seems to ultimately be that these statistics are reductive . that 's what it means when you say that a stat brings people down to their color and so on . we can reasonably identify how much explanatory power the variable of race has . if race does not have much explanatory power , then you 're right , and using race as the major metric of voting tendencies is deeply flawed . if race does have significant explanatory power , then a great deal of what a person is , relative to voting , is their race . you say that this takes a one dimensional view of non-one-dimensional people , but at this point you 're just taking an issue with statistics as a whole . statistics can sometimes feel uncomfortably impersonal , but it 's not the job of stats to give you the fundamental truth of an individual person . it 's the job of stats to grant access to broader truths about larger groups of people . furthermore , even from a non-mathematical perspective , i think that these categories have some obvious utility . simply put , while there are clear other factors in voting preferences , some policies straightforwardly impact certain categories of person in an outsized way . these questions matter , i think . they matter to politicians , because it tells them what various groups actually want , and they thus matter to people because they matter to politicians . releasing such data does not do justice to the multitude of reasons as to why people vote either way . any gay man could be a pianist , a car enthusiast or a book worm , but those things do n't really affect them all that much in political terms . women and black people for example have serveral issues that only affect them or affect them especially harsh ( like abortion or racist policies ) that makes them a group that has ( mostly ) similar problems and issues that ought to be adressed by politicians . it important to segment voters in this regard to analyze why some people might be voting against their interests , or why certain groups side with particular candidates . lets all be colour blind so we can ignore systematic racism . it 's going to be extremely hard to say that polls should n't break down information by demographics . voting data is n’t made public , those are exit polls ."
9uxj8h,"the u.s is too big to be governed by federal government . at first one government for the entire nation made sense because it was a quarter of the amount of states it has now . then it got bigger . then bigger . then bigger . manifest destiny expanded us all the way west . fight for texas . then we bought alaska and hawaii which are no where near us and we have no business governing their land thousands and thousands of miles away . there 's just too many people . too much vastly different territory . deserts , mountains , coastal regions , the midwest . islands . views understandably different across the different territories . it just got out of control . one man , has no business controlling all these different people and territories businesses and personal lives as president . and senators from say the northeast have no business making decisions that effect the southwest . obviously there will be disagreements , why should people suffer as a result ? so change my view that it makes sense having a federal government at this point .","no one state produces nearly enough on its own to have a stable economy and be a large player on the global scale the way we currently do as a nation . without a federal government , states do n't necessarily have to have free trade and resource sharing the way we do now ( since the federal government regulates interstate commerce ) . with how separate some areas are , would n't it be possible for one state to bar goods , services , or even visitors from another ? say one state says "" no more copyright laws "" and companies manufacture the goods of others that are protected in their states ? and if so , what would stop the other states from saying "" not my problem "" and leaving the attacked state to fend for itself ? well , you 're right that the president has too much power right now , but that 's more a problem of party politics than the country getting bigger . the federal government has a system of checks and balances in place to prevent any group or individual from getting too powerful . the president is kept in checked by the supreme court and congress , as well as the various state governments . the problem is that the system of checks and balances breaks down when most of the people in those offices are on the same team . the solution to the problem of the president being too powerful is not to break up the federal government , but to elect representatives that will keep him in check . currently this really just means "" people of the other party "" but a better , long term solution would be to revamp our first past the post election system to use something like ranked choice voting that makes it so we have more than two viable political parties at the federal level . this is why separation of powers exist , the president has , maybe , 10-20 % of the power vested in the federal government . the federal government has limited power for the exact reason you are describing . it 's tough to discuss unless you present certain examples where you feel the federal government is inappropriately involved . no one man controls all these things . this is why there is separation between the state and federal government . that 's why we have state , county , and city level governments . nobody thinks the federal government can govern the whole country , and they also did n't think that in the 1700s . certainly yes , but state governments also fail at things all the time ."
9ux8hm,"the us democratic party should abandon divisive but less consequential stands , such as on gun control , to gain support on consequential issues such as health care and trying to keep earth livable in texas , democratic candidate o'rourke just lost against republican incumbent ted cruz 51 % to 48 % , with some notable observations : > young voters overwhelmingly supported o'rourke , 71 to 29 percent . voters aged 30-44 leaned towards him 51 to 47 . voters over 45 favored cruz 58 to 41 . > white evangelicals favored cruz with 83 percent of their votes , while those not in this group supported o'rourke by a nearly 2-to-1 margin . looking at various comments , i see a number of voters opposing o'rourke on the basis that he 's a "" gun-grabber "" . others also add "" baby-killer "" . the present difference between the two parties literally involves whether we 're going to try to make a half-arsed attempt to keep the planet livable for our grandchildren 's children , or not . another issue of similarly gigantic proportions is access to health care . i believe these are super important issues . if these issues were resolved , gun control might matter . but as long as they remain open , gun control is minor , yet extremely divisive : excluding suicide , firearms are killing less than 14,000 people in the us per year . compare to car accidents killing 37,000 . drug overdoses alone are now killing over 70,000 per year in the us . a significant proportion of these deaths can be attributed to health care policy . just gaining the political capital to improve health care policies in a way that reduced overdoses by 20 % would save more lives than reducing firearms fatalities to zero . a significant proportion of the us population is highly passionate about access to firearms , and they have some legitimate arguments . even if this liberty does cost lives , it might provide a measure of resilience against chinese style authoritarianism . right now , authoritarianism is precisely something to worry about . just like a liberal voter can not be expected to compromise on a rights issue that cuts to the core of their identity , such as access to abortion ; so a conservative voter can not be expected to compromise on gun control . for these reasons , i think gun control - at least with much greater issues looming - is a poor choice of a hill to die on , and is suspicious to conservative voters . one might think - "" why do the democrats care so much about reducing access to guns when they know how i feel about it , and it 's a comparatively minor issue ? "" to someone thinking like that , this is a red flag suggesting that democrats want to install authoritarianism after all . it breaks trust and reinforces a political divide just when we need to bridge it .","even if a candidate , or hell , the party itself , stated outright that they were no longer pursuing those goals , conservative messaging would claim that they were lying , and would secretly engage in those activities once elected . you need 51 of them to vote for you to win . by saying you 're opposed to gun control , you 'll probably win a hard-core 30 of those voters for whom that 's the most important issue . but then again , with that same statement you 're going to turn off 20 other voters who will specifically \ not \ vote for you , because gun control to them is a really important issue . so let 's say you decide that health care is your next thing , and you say that you support dramatically reforming the u.s. system to more closely resemble a european system . the problem is , that 20 of those voters are the 20 that you turned off by saying you oppose gun legislation and they 're not gon na support you because of that . and it turns out that at least half of the 30 votes you gained by opposing gun control are going to stop supporting you because they also do n't want the medical system reformed to look more european . if you add in wanting to do something about climate you 'll probably lose the rest of the gun control voters while also not gaining enough votes to overcome that loss . this is all a hypothetical situation , and i 'm not even considering the power of the red team vs. blue team psychology that basically dominates politics now . you ca n't just ignore issues that people care about when you 're campaigning ; if people care about it you have to take a position . that 's why you do n't see candidates mixing platforms -- at least , not on the hot button social issues that get voters whipped up into an emotional frenzy . keep pushing government as the solution for everything , keep having them blame their problems on various - ism 's , keep allowing everyone who wants to come here come in any way they please and eventually you 'll win the numbers game permanently . the moment andrew gillum ( d ) running for florida governor spoke about gun control , i knew he was going to lose . could you expand on other points the dnc should set aside or are you specifically stating they should only relax on gun-control . but if they did this , then people would focus on the real issues like the fact that the government spends 20 % more money than it takes in and that we fight never-ending , unwinnable wars including wars against concepts like "" drugs "" and "" terror "" . the democrats have tried to compromise with republicans for the past 8 years , that 's lead them to the state they 're in now , which is n't all that great . given sentiment polling is flawed then presumably so is political research by those same means . if an entity wants reliable sentiment data they can not get it from phone polling anymore . thus the real issue is n't leaving guns alone or trying to burn the constitution again , it 's simply not knowing what people will be prepared to defect over . easy access to a highly lethal method of suicide greatly increases the risk of someone actually being able to kill themselves . and while it ’s possible someone might try another method , like pills , if guns are n’t an option , pills are an incredibly ineffective method of suicide — so restricting access to guns could potentially save thousands , if not tens of thousands , of lives . your argument implies that beto would have a net gain of voters by dropping the gun control issue . but part of what made him more successful that previous dem candidates in texas is that he is passionate about issues he cares about , which created a lot of enthusiasm . your argument around the scale of the gun control issue is also simplistic . it would be easier to reduce the number of gun related deaths by say 10,000 than reducing the number of vehicle deaths by the same amount . your actual argument is centered on gun control , which is a fine argument to have , and it 's one i will address in a moment . now gun control is , i happen to believe as a passionate liberal , a particular embarrassment of the liberal side of politics . gun control is not a "" minor "" issue to those whose lives are affected directly , and it 's not a "" minor "" issue to those , including myself , who empathize with them . worse for political discourse is the logical conclusion that they who scream the loudest get their way , which is logic no one can ever support ; that will make things worse and not better , because it rewards bad behavior , and thus encourages it for the next issue . i do n't think that , if the democrats were to drop gun control from their platform , gun owners would believe that they meant it . on your point about not compromising your core ideals as a liberal or a conservative , i think think your view of politics might be a little too simplistic . there is are significant minority factions within both of the parties ( tea party , socialists , libertarians , progressives , etc ) that have different views compared to a "" traditional "" liberal or conservative . even if gun control is not part of your core message , it is certainly part of someone else 's in your party . the better-to-reign crowd could n't care less how they divide us , they do n't care about making a world anybody else wants to live in so the issues do n't matter , what matters is the division . i do n't think gun control is that divisive , really . public support for stricter gun control is around 70 % , and even many republicans support it . the people who fiercely oppose gun control are a vocal minority . i 'm also not certain that this same opposition would be any more willing to relent on issues like healthcare . do you really think the people who are convinced the government is trying to take all their guns are going to be any more receptive to the government providing socialized healthcare ? i 'd also argue with the assertion that gun control is a minor issue . the mere fact that it comes up in so many debates , and is a platform of so many politicians , shows that voters consider it a non-trivial issue . including suicide puts gun deaths at over 33,000 and over 75,000 injuries . many people get into a car multiple times per day , while large portions of the population rarely touch a gun , so while the total deaths may be similar , the ratio of deaths to uses for guns is likely drastically worse . most people recognize that car fatalities are a huge problem , and we actively work to make them safer , both with new laws and new safety features on cars . betos stance on gun control is very mild , also he has n't killed any babies as far as i know . he 's called a gun grabber , but has never proposed general confiscation of guns . changing his stance on these issues will not convince these people to vote for him , it will just discourage other people to vote at all . for example , i do n't think gun issues are not consequential at all . the us is the only developed country that suffers from peacetime gun violence of the current scale , however unlikely it is for an average citizen to get shot in an absolute sense . the most difficult part about implementing your suggestion is deciding which issues to pursue . in the democratic party , i believe most of the issues that get adopted by the party platform are pushed forward in a reasonable manner by those who care . if you ask me , i 'd say the quickest way for the democratic party to win over white evangelicals ( and thus winnignevery election ) is dropping or at least softening their stance on abortion , and yet it is probably impossible to do so because a large majority of democrats who make the party what it is actually care about this issue and are willing to risk losing almost all white evangelical votes . republicans will believe whatever fox news tells them . if they say "" democrats are going to take your guns "" , the reality that gun control is n't an issue for most democrats is completely irrelevant . democrats were in power 8 years ago under obama controlling every part of government . the real issue is that democrats promise change but then go and pass healthcare reform that does n't help people much , massive handouts to companies that have out bad loans while punishing people , and not doing anything about corruption/immigration/drugs / tax avoidance/etc . this is why they lost ( aside from running the literally least popular and shadiest democrat possible - regardless of what you think of her personally ) and why trump won . the reality is that democrats and many politicians are too disconnected from what people want and that drives them to picking more and more extreme candidates . people are fed up with politicians ignoring their issues and not delivering . had the democrats improved people 's lives in a meaningful way thought obama 's tenure they would be doing well now . i love that "" trying to keep earth livable "" requires a group of people to compromise to bring adequate attention to it . cruz pointed that out about him , but that wasnt beto 's focus . cruz could point out any democrat and say that they want to take away your guns , kill babies , abandon israel , etc and he would be believed because people in texas assume that democrats are all like that and do n't bother to do any research . for example , abortion was n't an issue when both parties were for outlawing it in the 19th century . then it became an issue the left could run on - culminating in roe vs wade , with many on the right also championing legal abortion due to their alignment with personal liberty and feeling that the unwanted children would n't become a liability on the state . eventually , however , the right found it was an issue they could run on and mobilize the religious right ."
9uw8rs,"in the us , federal policies related to issues such as illegal immigration , which disproportionately affect states , should see weighted representation by state . problem : not all states ( and furthermore counties ) are equal . there are inherent differences between states that mean that there are issues that only certain states face . the constitution recognizes one such difference - population - and deliberately tries to correct for this . however , there are no such corrections for differences that are more complex then population . examples of these differences that are n't corrected for include geographical categories like coastlines , weather and natural resources . federal policies that are greatly influenced by these differences mentioned previously , can lead to situations where states are effected differently by policy outcomes that can lead to unfair outcomes . for example , representatives from states that are not effected by a particular issue would be ~ ~ less likely to vote for federal funding directed toward that issue . ~ ~ edit : sorry , i see why everybody is talking specifically about federal funding . i agree that this ca n't work for funding . i was originally thinking towards policies that allow or forbid individual actions . for example , a policy that forbids lgbt people from using certain bathrooms . or a policy that does not allow convicted immigrants to stay in the country or the dream act . my thought is that for certain policies that have measurable differences in impact on the state level , states should have weighted representation by their perceived impact . i believe that this would create better outcomes for the country and for the states themselves . & #x200b ; case study when applied to immigration : on the surface , it makes sense that immigration policy has to be on the federal level as it deals with people becoming citizens of the country , not specific states . however , illegal immigrants are not distributed the around the country equally , with most of the absolute number being located on the border states :[ -- url -- ) & #x200b ; in the current system , when creating legislation , all representatives of the house and senate have an equal say , but yet they and their constituents are not equally effected by the issue . i would argue , that states ( and perhaps even counties at the level of the house ) which have a higher number of illegal immigrants would have more credibility in deciding the path forward for our policy on this issue . & #x200b ; given an agreed upon metric , i believe it should be possible to weight votes by that metric . a naive approach for this example would be to take the absolute immigration count and do a running percentage sum to determine the percentage share . & #x200b ; issues \ - agreeing upon metrics . i believe that these would need to be voted on occasionally . \ - agreeing upon what issues would be included in this group . no solution currently","should texas be the sole decider of how ( and how much ) federal funds are spent to recover from the hurricane ? now , consider the border states want to spend billions and billions of federal dollars on the border . sure , the immigrants may mostly live in the border states , but their purchasing decisions affect the economy of nearby states that import/export . their existence affects nearby states ' policy decisions ( if i pass bill x that 's popular among immigrant group y it could draw a bunch of them to by state from the next one over ) and how much weight is each state given ? and that 's off the top of my head for one issue . these people can enter and then move amongst other states . does this mean that the states that contribute the most to federal funds get a greater voice in every discussion that involves federal funds ?"

9uviny,"it 's absolutely ridiculous that the military ( us ) gets a budget of 500 + billion dollars while institutions like nasa and the education system barely get a quarter , if that , of the military 's budget . i find it unbelievable . usually when i talk to someone about this , they say that our countries defense is more important over nasa and education , but that does n't really make sense to me . would n't funding nasa and education make us smarter as a nation ? also , tell me if i 'm wrong , but to me there is no possible way they use all of that money . i remember seeing a youtube video where they talk about how the military buys new bullets every year because they want to , while the exess bullets from last year are used for training . in addition , why on earth do they need that much money when we are n't even in any major wars ? if we were in a world war or something , i 'm all for a large military budget . but we are n't , so why do they need that much money ? also , rip inbox .","the military does not even make up a 1/3 of the u.s budget , much of the funding for the programs you describe should be taken from the failing social security regime that takes up nearly 60 % along with the military funding more engineering research programs than all grant-giving institutions in the u.s. the military is a huge welfare system moving low class families to middle class . so the us k-12 education system is funded at the local ( state , county , city ) level . combined , the annual u.s. k-12 education spend is $ 650 + billions per year in 2014-2015 , on par with military spend . also the defense department also funds a lot of r&d through the darpa program . nasa , on the other hand , does not help up economically nearly as much . our military budget is a waste , but so is space exploration money goes into priorities like securing the military that keeps the currency governing the world secure from outside threats . as education is largely funded by state and local government , where military is not . we spend more on our military than the next top 10 spending countries combined , far more than china which has the second highest military budget . the problem with the us military budget is a huge amount of misuse and waste . if we actually had someone pay attention to spending and cut out the wasted money , we could likely cut our military budget significantly . but hey , when certain politicians are in the pockets of military contractors and other companies , they believe spending $ 1,280 per coffee mug for the air force is a good deal ( totaling over $ 300,000 spent for this $ 1,280 coffee mug ) . this $ 1,280 coffee mug is only the most recent example of gross misspending . ( if you do a search for "" military spending waste "" or "" us military waste "" , you 'll find plenty of articles about military misspending . ) cheat sheet : the disturbing ways we waste money our military budget in essence , military budget does not specifically go toward things you would typically associate with war . in fact , much of nasas technology was invented in its primal form by the military . i could certainly expand on this quite a bit but what you should know mainly is that a number of governmental agencies rely on the military 's budget and personnel , which factors into their budget . the us military is a global force that works to protect not only the us , but us allies . exert soft power ) , train allied militaries ( i.e. nato ) , develop new technologies ( ex . moreover , the entire global economic system is dependent on western military power . if we were to start slashing our military budget , a country like china could come in and grow their global footprint , thus giving them more soft power diplomatically , as well as hard power militarily . of course the military budget is going to dwarf all other types of spending . this is an old comment of mine , talking about if the military 's budget was reduced to 20 % of federal discretionary funding ( down from 54 % ) . the reason being that the us is scared of being weak and historically put money towards the military . the government needs of an overwhelming military requires more funding than the government needs of an education system or science system . i would love to see nasa and our education system realize $ 500b a year budgets , but that is n't satisfying a need , that is satisfying a want . if the military were reduced to zero , our country would be instantly invaded and decimated ; other systems would see zero funding because they would n't exist anymore . if nasa and our education system were defunded completely by public money , life would go on , it just would suck more and eventually we would fall behind other countries and life would suck even more . a lot of nasa and education is strictly a desire for better lives , and serves little benefit in keeping our lives existing in the first place . a lot of the military budget is wholly unnecessary , as you said , but the vast majority of the money goes into 2 things : people and the economy . for starters , the demands of the military , like nasa drive forward innovation . so we outsource those designs to large aerospace and military companies like boeing . eventually , those products wind up being released as domestic goods . maybe , by developing better fire safety equipment for the military , boeing releases new fire safety equipment for commercial airliners , new homes or any other number of applications . high end military drones lead to the civilian versions , now amazon is seeking to impliment them to improve the shipping of all items under 5 lbs . which is 84 % of the goods they sell . this also greatly reduces amazon 's pollution contribution as a company , since drones are inherently electric and as a result are much more green friendly . threats to the stability of other countries , is now so crucial to the u.s. economy , it is to our benefit to aid other countries with their militaristic issues , because doing so grows the pie . a warehouse slows this process , by avoiding direct contact with moisture , but inevitably as a safety measure , you must decommission dated equipment . if a soldier fires and old bullet on the gun range , and it blows up , sees mechanical failure or leaks gunpowder into his weapon , its much less likely to get him killed than if it were to happen in a enemy combatant zone . having the most reliable equipment is essential to having a strong military . this is greatly magnified when we are talking about specialty parts for military equipment . we spend more than a lot of countries on education and the results as the government gets more involved are not improving with the money spent . according to google , there are 1.4 million people in the usa armed forces . there are more than 80x as many employees in the armed forces than in nasa . so if nasa is getting 25 % of the funding that the armed forces are , but only have to pay 1.25 % as many people , well , it sure sounds like nasa is getting more money to invest in new projects than the armed forces are . lastly america has so many allied agreements that they ’ll come to there defence that there military needs to be able to honor all those requests at the same time . that ’s why the military is so large but the budget on the other hand is a different matter . almost none of its annual budget goes to growing the military although congress does like to spend extra money outside the set aside budget on the military . another is making healthcare/higher education a thing for all american citizens rather than just for the military and other programs . the real only other way to drastically reduce the military spending is to not adhere to the current doctrine , risk not honoring american agreements , and also relinquish the title of world police which would a huge geopolitical shift that would easily start some actual nation vs nation wars and possibly start ww3 . although you are correct that nasa and education need larger budgets and particularly education just needs a giant ass overhaul to be functional again ; i do n’t think you could drastically reduce the military budget to pay for it unless you ’re willing to sacrifice american power in the process . we must put 500 billion dollars in our military not because it 's a good idea , but because people think it 's a good idea . even the simple thought of putting one billion dollars towards anything else is outrageous to many in our country as well as our leaders ; a need power , greed , hate , jealousy , everything considered to be human emotion is something we must shed in order to be . but this wont happen will it , we 're all just too stupid it seems . none of this changes the fact that education and the need to travel through our universe will always be something that is far greater than any military , that those emotions i listed previously are useless and unneeded ; if you can make the world understand this , you will likely go down in history as the single greatest human to ever live , one that thrust us into a new era , the first human to become something greater than human . in conclusion , the military gets a budget of 500 + billion because we need that money to not die , obviously there 's a price behind everything we build but , this question has greater potential than just some economic squabble . the question of why the defense budget is high is totally fair . countries are too scared to do anything like what germany and japan did in ww2 , trying to take over other countries for conquest , because they fear all-out war with the united states coming to their defense , and they know they ca n't win , because their military is small compared to ours . do you rob the house that has a car with a fop ( fraternal order of police ) sticker on the license plate ? the united states is close to 3.6 % , the uk , poland , estonia , and even broke greece pays at least 2 % ... but the vast majority of nato members barely pay 1 % . we the people of the united states , in order to form a more perfect union , establish justice , insure domestic tranquility , provide for the common defence , promote the general welfare , and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity , do ordain and establish this constitution for the united states of america . i just wan na say that military spending is 20 % of the total federal budget ( mandatory + discretionary spending ) . social security and medicare combined make up more than 50 % of the total federal budget . would like to add that america already spends more money on education per student than the rest of the world , yet we still do relatively poorly in stem fields ( less so when it comes to education as a whole , but yeah ) when it comes to exams and stuff . the problem is not in spending on education , but how that money is being spent . funding nasa would not necessarily make us smarter as a nation . do n't get me wrong here , nasa should have a larger budget , but it does not necessarily mean people will be smarter . defense exists so that nasa and school are able to do so in peace e.g. infrastructure , nasa , social welfare , foreign aid , education , national defense ... each of us have different priorities and values therefor between us we 'll get all the necessary bases covered . as others have pointed out , education is funded primarily at the local and state levels . all in all , the us spent 5.5 % of gdp on education in 2014 . to be fair - spending on the military and defense is almost exclusively through the federal government , whereas spending on education or healthcare is split through various mechanisms - federal , state , local , and private . so if the federal government is responsible for 100 % of the funding for military/defense , but only fraction of the funding for education ( the overwhelming majority is through state and local governments ) - then that would skew the numbers when drawing a comparison to illustrate the priorities of spending as a whole . the reality is , the us spends more per capita on education than almost every other oecd nation . the military , like any other occupation or profession , is one where training and practice make actual execution go smoothly . now , i 'd love to cover some topics about the military and education spending . first of all , the education system does not get just a quarter of the us military budget . it 's True that the federal government only spends around $ 126 billion usd a year in education . however , look at those state and local totals - the states spent $ 304 billion usd and local government spent $ 672 billion usd that same year . so the idea that we spend more on the military than on education is completely False . for instance , nasa and the military cooperate on a lot of things . nasa uses air force facilities - like cape canaveral air station , vandenberg air force base , edwards air force base , etc. to do research and launch rockets . nasa and the military cooperate on a ton of experimental aircraft - take a look at this list . again , name a famous astronaut - neil armstrong , buzz aldrin , jim lovell , scott kelly , etc. - all were military . finally , consider this : the same people that build weapons for the military ... are the same contractors for nasa . there 's a whole lot to talk about , and since you seem interested in learning , take a look at my post on military spending in general as well as the military 's relationship with nasa and how it 's not an either-or situation the corona satellite , used to spy on the ussr , was cloaked as part of a nasa space technology research . nasa was n’t the agency who funded the research the dods budget did . i will have to assume your comment did n’t include defense advanced research projects agency ( darpa ) who in essence starts and funds many space programs , then turns the programs over to nasa when technology becomes old ( to their standards ) or is not useful to their mission . let ’s not forget the dod also provides funds for 5 highly regarded universities and schools . do you think if you attend a military college , had a guaranteed job after graduation , and work for the space force r&d , do you think you might have a slightly different view on the defense budget and education ? the dod budget is so large not because of bullets , or jet a ( jet fuel ) , or even because of expensive tanks or ships . ( although we could be way more efficient with our ship building/maintenance if politics did n't come into play so much ) . if you want to lower the budget and free up money for nasa ( which i think would be a good thing ) we need to fix healthcare costs . we can still be a global force and have money for nasa if we fix healthcare in this country . people think that the budget is due to buying more guns and tanks , sure thats part of it but a big portion is also just maintaining military bases . eisenhower was right about the nature of the military industrial complex , but he completely missed how the nature of warfare had changed . if he understood that , he might have kept his mouth shut - the military industrial complex is a necessary evil in modern warfare . when we declared war in ww2 , it took us months to draft an army , build it 's equipment , transport them overseas , and put it to war . modern warfare means that when you declare war , you are going to fight the war with the army you have the day it was declared . look at it this way - if we paid our soldiers what the chinese paid theirs , we could cut our military budget in half . our military costs are inflated in large part because we pay our soldiers well and develop expensive technology to minimize collateral damage . the billionaire is spending more in absolute terms but a much smaller slice of what he has . the superior technology ( military and public ) , protection of allies , jobs and family healthcare , humanitarian work , safe waterways , army core of engineer projects , gps , the most peaceful era in history , and the best security in the galaxy . we pay our soldiers relatively well ( compared to china/russia ) , better benefits , equipment , training , the largest logistical backbone on the planet , etc . this is actually a huge part of the military budget , much bigger than actual procurement ( new equipment ) . we spend a lot of money on developing smart weapons so that we minimize collateral damage . in comparison our strongest ally the uk spends $ 55b to protect 0.87 % of the total world population ( though if they actually got in a fight the us would be doing the bulk of the defense ) . but we overgeneralize a few media stories , like your bullet youtube video , into a caricature of how military spending actually works . i would challenge the claim that education only gets a fraction of the funding of the military . that only appears to be True is you look at the budget of the us department of education , but ignores the fact that most education spending in the us is financed at the state and local levels . total national expenditures on k-12 education in the us are more than $ 600 billion per year , quite a bit more than we spend on the military . the states spend another $ 100 billion or so towards funding higher education . fyi nasa 's budget is around $ 18b , which is closer to 2-3 % of the military 's budget , not 25 % . the bulk of that money goes to military retirement , gi bill , & other benefits . not really disagreeing with the post in general , but i do n't see how buying new bullets and using the old ones for training is an example of superfluous spending . while i do not disagree with the concept behind your premise , the us military spends much more money on research and development in the public and private sector than most people realize . sections of government such as the office of naval research ( onr ) contribute great sums of money to researchers in fields like material science , laser development , and heat transfer just to name a few that i 've worked with in the past . this money spent on "" the military "" is being used in a huge variety of ways that ultimately advance scientific knowledge , as well as pay for soldiers , military bases , education , and yes , bullets , ships , and missiles . i wholeheartedly endorse your sentiment though that more money can and should be allocated for these purposes . i would rather the money be directly given to research institutions instead of first going through the military , but that just reflects the values of the us . so giving the money to the military to distribute in a way that they seem fit allows the us to remain a militarily dominant . i should mention that much of the research that the military funds never actually has any harmful military application . something i dont see mentiond yet ; the us military budget is spent on lots of stuff , including things you may use everyday . a portion of the military budget for the us air force is spent on the maintenance and improvement of the gps system . \ # 3 it takes a long time to build maintain and train to properly use complex military equipment as well as work in unison . i think it 's also telling that we pay our most elite troops x , but private contractors are willing to pay those same elite troops 5x . at least the military does n't waste their budget on putting out obviously faked videos like nasa . there 's also the very practical aspect of "" who 's gon na force the dude with all the weapons to stop taking our money ? "" if there are many small powers then there will be many wars . if there are only two or three very large powers and their allies then wars will be rare , maybe generational . but they will happen when someone makes a serious error , and will blow up in world wars that take a noticeable chunk out of the global population . it 's the pure sciences that we should be investing a more sizeable chunk of money on , things that do n't have practical applications that we can make money on now but might in the future . i do n't think nasa or the education system are anything as profitable . it takes a lot of money to train , equip , and retain military members . at the same time , the military does waste a lot of money . this all depends on your political philosophy of the role of the national state . many americans feel that the federal government should n't provide an explicit role at all in innovation ( nasa ) or education ( doed ) -- the federal governments main role is to provide a national defense . a national defense is something that is clearly made stronger by a "" united states "" , whereas promoting innovation and education is n't necessarily made stronger by the federal governments role in this . individual states and communities can choose to work together to support innovation ( eg local tax breaks to certain companies ) and education ( eg localities determine tax rates that go to fund schools ) . in short , the federal budget is not the only way to judge a nations priorities . not an opinion either way but potentially could effect your thoughts . i 'm in the military and regardless of how much of a budget we have i still see funding problems all the time . in basic training my company had half the ammo as the next company just because there was n't enough funds for everyone . i got canceled for 1ish year before they could finally send me because when they requested funds for me to go there were none available . long story short i 'm in a special operations company and i 've seen issues with funding so i imagine being in a normal unit theres even less funds available . education , healthcare , welfare , nasa , insert favorite federal program here ; is n’t . your view does n’t take into account the fact that education spending is largely state funded while the federal budget for education is mostly to cover the student loan program and pell grants . total up the amount of money spent on k12 education for each state and then compare to the military . i ’m all for more nasa funding , but it is a single agency with a single mission , the military budget covers a wide array of fields and missions . surprised nobody has mentioned it but the school system in the united states is almost overwhelmingly funded and ran on the state/county level . hell i 'm a homeowner and i just got my property tax bill for the year . the is military employs about a million people of low income/low education background . in short , the reason you are able to freely sit on your computer and complain about military spending is because of military spending . the reason we are able to freely do anything in this country , like go to school and go to space , is because of the security that our military has provided . not funding nasa may decrease our learning about things with questionable practicality . not adequately funding the military , on the other hand , may jeopardize our entire existence . but let ’s not pretend that nasa even exists on the same plane of importance as the military . estimate for dod ( which includes nsa ) , va , state dept , dhs , fbi , nuclear weapons is $ 892 billion for fy 2019 according to -- url -- personally i would not count all of state dept and dhs and fbi in that , so maybe subtract out $ 15 billion or so . cia has military or paramilitary functions in many countries , including in war zones such as afghanistan , iraq and yemen . this may be another $ 60 billion or so , judging from -- url -- ( some sources say much higher ; i think this is relevant although i ca n't access it right now : -- url -- ) some people would add the interest on the national debt due to past deficit-spending on wars and the military . we 're paying over $ 300 billion per year in interest on the national debt , according to -- url -- maybe fair to assign 1/3 of that , so $ 100 billion each year , to "" military spending "" ? i do n’t believe nasa should have a bigger budget as we now have private companies that do way more in shorter times with less money ex spacex but education sees we ’ve some love i believe that because of miltary budget is so high it makes us the greatest country in the world because we are the most powerful and they do spend most of it look up how much 15 mcdonnell douglas fighter jet cost its alot out of the whole 18 trillion gdp is there really nothing from which they could divert money towards nasa that is less important than the country 's national security ? from year to year , that 's a little more or a little less than the military budget , not "" barely a quarter "" of it . the vast majority of that comes from state budgets , not the federal budget , but very little military spending happens at the state level . if you 're arguing that a program should be federal spending , you need to make a case for why it should be taken away from the states . that case is easy to make for military spending , but harder to make for education spending . more money is n't going to fix anything , it 'll just buy the corrupt admins bleeding the system dry bigger houses . last i knew , we spent more than the next 14 countries put together on our military ... yet i 've tried arguing with 3 or more republicans ( i do n't remember if i discussed it with both grandfathers or just one , not if my uncle was around for any of it ) ... and i thought 2 of them were at least ~ usually ~ reasonable , but they would n't even accept reducing it to spending as much as the next 12 countries put together . like i doubt they 'd even accept shifting 1 % of the military budget to more important things like education . even if i 'm against violence , crime , guns , wars , ... i know my idealism will not prevent reality from happening , i would eventually do it and try to protect my family . entire cities are based around military bases and are dependent on the money gained from supporting the military . the scope of work for the us armed forces is to protect the most powerful and economically and politically globally integrated nation from an international theater of traditional , terrorist , nuclear , and cyber threats from nations and organizations with collective funding in the trillions . every penny we spend on the united states military is a penny we spend protecting nasa and our school systems and our hospital systems and our education systems . the only way that budget cuts to the military make sense is if there is not a credible threat to invest in protecting ourselves from . if you think that the world is suddenly safe because of our quiet domestic experience , then you 're mistaking the effectiveness of our military for the lack of our enemies hostility and capacity to harm us . the best way to deter a fight is by hiding , running , or being an obviously powerful opponent ."
9uun8e,"conservatives actually want gov ' t to regulate business , provide universal healthcare , get god out of schools , make public college free , and make immigration easier . i 'll explain . note : i know the sub bio says "" mindset for conversation , "" but i 'd really appreciate people trying to poke holes in my argument , so i can see if i can patch them . also seems like that 's the whole point of the sub , so not sure why that rule is there ( i guess this part is a bonus cmv ) . to be clear , i 'm not looking to debate , in case any mods are reading -- only looking to converse over constructive criticism . tl ; dr : american conservatism is a set of principles that totally implodes on close inspection , and so conservatives therefore have not spent enough time reflecting on their views . & #x200b ; conservatives miss it , but the three core tenets of american conservatism are : stronger government regulation of big business , free public services , and freer immigration . i 'll explain . "" social conservatism "" upholds strong traditional values . by extension , american social conservatism upholds strong american values . america was founded as a nation by , for , and of the people . for the general good of the public . corporations seek to make money , and historically have done this at any cost . look at how the laissez-faire economic policy of pre-industrial revolution america mingled with a more modern economy : the middle class plummeted , labor conditions were horrible , and giant corporations held a huge segment of the public in a choke-hold . it was only after the republican president roosevelt used the anti-trust laws ( and the rest of the government took other steps ) to more heavily regulate businesses that conditions got better , and america was able to step closer to that egalitarian city on a hill it was meant to be . america was founded to be a utopia . we ca n't forget that . when the rest of the world was stuck in the monarchical , royalist past , we went a different way : the way of the people and the future . if social conservatives really do uphold strong , traditional american values , they need to be like the founding fathers and prevent those with power from taking advantage of the public . regulating business is a key step in this . when we set limitations on how much power any one person can have , both in government and business , we make it easier for everyone to be free . in the government , this means no private money funding political campaigns , limits on the power of the president , more transparency in the tax system , better public education , etc . in the private sector , we need to make it harder for one entity to rise to the top and monopolize it ( think google , amazon , at&t , comcast , visa , etc. ) . since a conservative wants a free market , they should n't want any one entity controlling a huge sector of that market . a fiscal conservative wants people to get off welfare , right ? cut taxes , cut spending ? then they must want better labor and wage laws , and free education . if people want to work for a living , they have to earn a living when they work . that means raising the minimum wage . now more people can afford to get off welfare and start building their own financial future . since they have free education , more people can get degrees and trades now , too ! and you know what else ? let 's take a turn and cut some regulation : employers are no longer required to pay benefits . why ? because in the interest of cutting spending , conservatives actually want to move health insurance to the public sector . i 'll explain . the us government spends more money on healthcare for its citizens than any other nation on earth ( double , in fact ) . conservatives can cut spending and prevent this by making one giant healthcare pool and putting everyone in it -- lower rates for the vast majority , and less spending because people have been shown in other countries to seek better care , more often and sooner , after instituting universal healthcare . this makes for a happy , healthy public , which is what strong , traditional american values stand for . not to mention you now spend $ 0 to some private-owned insurance company . so you end up saving money and living healthier ! conservatives also want god out of public schools , off public buildings , and erased from us currency . if they 're christian , they also want an end to public prayer . the constitution forbids the promotion of one god over another by the government , a practice unheard of at the time . by writing "" in god we trust , "" and similar mottoes , we put the christian god above others and directly violate the constitution of the united states -- breaking rule # 1 of social conservatives . this is also True in public schools . if they teach creationism , as many do , they must also teach every other religion 's creation story . or ( and this is simpler ) , they do n't teach any creation stories and opt instead for science . remember america ca n't favor any one religion over any other , right ? and christianity 's own teachings ( king james , matthew 6:5 ) condemn those who practice public prayer , so for the christians among them , that 's out too . finally , immigration . the declaration of independence holds "" we hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights , that among these are life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . "" it very pointedly does not specify "" all american men are created equal . "" this country was founded by immigrants . not only that , they were undocumented immigrants . so clearly the founding values , and arguably the most traditional , of this country are those of immigration : america wants people to come here and have a chance to live in the greatest country on earth . if conservatives uphold those traditions , they 'll be happy to let people come and live here . as it stands , government regulations around immigration are insane . it 's such a prime example of runaway government regulation , conservatives should be frothing at the mouth trying to streamline it . after all , these people often risk death just to come here , clearly the hard-working individuals on whose backs this country was built ( remember the railroads ? ) . so if social conservatives want to uphold the traditional , founding values of the country they love , they welcome all immigrants and asylum-seekers with open arms and not a mountain of unnecessary government red tape .","i think you are making assertions for what conservatives are arguing for and twisting them in a way to go along with your own views . raising the minimum wage has resulted in unemployment going up and business going out of business . so no , conservatives do n’t argue for a higher minimum wage because we want people to make more money . it was founded by a group of rich landowning white men . the original constitution specifically allowed slavery and kept the vote from the vast majority of people who were n't rich landowning white men . america has been and still is a majority christian country . conservatives generally want to maintain that to conserve a historical prelapsarian america nothing is free , it is unlikely that any fiscal conservative will agree with your assertion that a free education is possible . whether or not you believe this many fiscal conservatives do not . they do not think the evidence indicates it therefore they do not support it . government mandated education is taking tax dollars from people to force them to go to school . an important thing to analyze when talking about a policy is what incentives it establishes . in a market system it is less likely they would have incurred all the debt to earn a degree that had no job prospects . sweden is often posited as an example for this . they went to single payer , the system almost completely collapsed , and they had to re-privatize health care . i can get different conservative principles from social , fiscal , or religious conservative views by focusing on distaste for federal ( but not state ) regulation , wanting a tiny federal government because of concern about tyrrany , or by pulling a santorum like move of getting constitutional rights from christianity , rather than from the constitution itself . the values and policies that you cited are n't inconsistent with a certain reading of conservatism , but they are not an essential part of it either . big theories of the world are like a family of views , rather than a set of simple values and rules . i think you 're incorrectly assuming that people 's ideologies are internally consistent , when the reality is people can live with some pretty significant contradictions , especially at the margins , and especially if you only examine the ideology and not the reality . for example , you can believe in environmentalism and also industrial deregulation , as long as you do n't examine the data showing that industries will lie about their environmental policies , cheat to manipulate date about their environmental impacts , and take advantage of the public to make a profit . it just happens that power allows you to enact the internally inconsistent policies that the party out of power can only fantasize about . \ > if social conservatives really do uphold strong , traditional american values , they need to be like the founding fathers and prevent those with power from taking advantage of the public . when we set limitations on how much power any one person can have , both in government and business , we make it easier for everyone to be free . i do n't think setting limits makes people more free . \ > in the government , this means no private money funding political campaigns , limits on the power of the president , more transparency in the tax system , better public education , etc . \ > in the private sector , we need to make it harder for one entity to rise to the top and monopolize it ( think google , amazon , at&t , comcast , visa , etc. ) . we already have anti-trust laws to stop companies using monopoly power to hurt consumers ."
9uuleq,"the woman should not always have the ability to decide on abortion i think that abortion should be viewed through a capitalist framework . that is , the person who owns the fetus gets to decide the fate of the fetus . to use an analogy , if i purchase all of the ingredients for a cake and then bake a cake , the cake belongs to me , i can do whatever i want with the cake . there is a nuance to this however , if i rent my labor to someone else , my labor becomes an ingredient in the production of the cake , therefore the cake belongs to the person who purchased my labor . the problem is that in the current system , society mistakenly believes that the woman owns the fetus . this is not the case . the woman used the ingredient of male sperm in order to build the fetus , therefore the sperm owner has partial ownership of the fetus . the woman can not decide what to do with the fetus alone . stipulation : verbal or contractual agreement prior to submission of required sperm about production of fetus . the situation would be different if the woman bought the sperm . in that case she has full ownership of the fetus and therefore can do whatever she wants with the fetus . similarly , if a man gave the sperm and purchased a pregnancy surrogate , then the man has full ownership of the fetus . the man decides the fate of the fetus . finally , if an entrepreneur purchases both the sperm and the pregnancy surrogate , then the fetus belongs to the entrepreneur and he gets to decide the fate of the fetus . the argument from anti-abortion advocates will be "" it 's a human , therefore it 's not a normal possession and therefore has to abide by special rules "" . to this i ask , why ? why does it have to abide by special rules ? what gives you the right to say it must abide by special rules and what is the special qualifier in humans that puts them under the umbrella of these "" special rules "" ? and who decides these things ? who decides that there is this special qualifier in humans and who decides these special rules ? in my view , the anti-abortion advocate arbitrarily just "" made up "" these special qualifiers and special rules . now , if the anti-abortion advocates group together a number of like-minded heads and all agree on these arbitrary qualifiers and special rules and agree to commit violence upon anyone who disagrees , i.e create a state law , that 's fine . but , do n't lie and tell me that the rules are n't arbitrarily created by you and your group of like-minded heads . what i 'm talking about here are the laws of capitalism , which i agree are man-made , but the capitalist framework provides some consistency rather than resorting to new arbitrary frameworks for a multitude of different circumstances . to use an analogy to explicate the idea that humans do n't fall under special rules based on special qualifiers : imagine that slavery is an available option and i am allowed to obtain a slave either through purchase or through conquest . am i allowed to do whatever i want with the slave including kill it ? clearly the answer is yes , because to whom else does the slave belong besides me ? if the slave is not producing value for me , i have a right to kill it . by contrast , if i rent a person , there is an implicit contract suggesting that the seller 's body will be available once again for future renting or for self-use after the rent period is over , so i can not kill the rented individual . in the case of the fetus , to whom else does the fetus belong besides the people who owns the ingredients : sperm , egg and womb . the fetus did not negotiate any rent contracts . ---- added stipulation for first case ( sperm or pregnancy surrogate is not purchased ) : there is some kind of verbal or written agreement regarding production of fetus prior to submission of sperm as a necessary ingredient .","there are lots of different ways of defining how , when , and under what circumstances things can be owned , held , and transferred . similarly , there are different ways to define human rights - to you , ownership of children and other people is acceptable because anything more substantive is "" arbitrary "" . though that reasoning applies to ownership in general - we just have conventions on what ownership means , and they apply imperfectly in the world . that 's arbitrary in the same way moral rules are . moral philosophers tend to agree on the claim that "" slavery is bad "" as being fairly well settled . if i own an oven , i 'm also allowed to destroy my oven because it is my property . i 'm allowed to rent or sell the oven to you . as part of the terms of the sale or rental , i can allow you to destroy the oven too . i 'm legally allowed to fully transfer control of the oven to you . the owner of the womb gets to choose whether a baby is grown there or not . they can rent out their womb ( i.e. , surrogacy ) , but they are expressly forbidden from granting full control . a woman can never legally hand full control of the womb to someone else . it 's entirely possible to create a society where a woman can rent out her womb completely to someone else , but it 's illegal in the united states today . the best you can do is just willfully follow an agreement where you do hard labor without killing yourself , keep a vow of silence , and refuse to get an abortion if the person who you have rented your womb tells you not to . similar posts can be found through our [ deltalog search ] ( -- url -- + | + abort + | + pro-life + | + pro-choice & restrict if i buy all the ingredients to the cake , am i allowed to barge into your house to use your oven to make it ? this analogy holds True in very few real life instances , and does not apply to human bodily autonomy . your analogy could suggest that if someone borrowed ingredients for a cake and then the cake would not solely belong to the person who made it . if i go to my neighbor to borrow a cup of sugar for a cake and my neighbor obliges , as the creator of the cake i have the ability to eat the cake myself or to share the cake with others . if i the person who lent or gave me the sugar took me to small claims court for the cost of the sugar , they would have no claim because the sugar was given freely and unless there is a contract specifying an exchange , they would have no case . this analogy however is useless to make a point for human life because slavery has been abolished and humans are not in fact property . doctors , friends , and family are all people who may have an emotional say in whether or not a pregnancy should be terminated . but i believe that the final say lies with the person carrying the fetus . a taxi drivers job is to transport a human life from point a to point b. let ’s say that a human who in need of the taxis service needs to go home , and what the driver does n’t know is that to complete the delivery they most go through a dangerous part of town . the driver must make a decision : to stop the journey and apologize to the client or to continue even though there is high probability of trouble . some may say that the taxi driver has an obligation to finish the trip . and certainly the company that has invested in this taxi driver and the car will be upset if the job is not finished . ultimately , it is up to the driver to decide whether they value their own safety over the other parties involved . unless the contract that the driver i under states that they must complete the journey , any objection in court would be null and void . for starters , i do n't think it 's either healthy or accurate to view the act of conception as a financial transaction ( except perhaps in cases of surrogacy ) . that aside , if you want to use the exchange of labour as an analogy , what work does the man actually do apart from donate his sperm ? it 's the woman alone who has the burden of having the fetus grow and develop inside her own body for 9 months and then give birth to it . obviously the father should have some input into the fate of the fetus , but ultimately it 's the woman who has the final say . you ca n't force someone to either give birth or have an abortion against their will . the woman owns the oven , and the man does n't . she can at any time decide to withdraw access to the oven ."

9utg6s,"abolish the penny ! the penny ( as in the us currency ) is practically useless . from both an economic , and patriotic standpoint , it would be in america 's best interest to abolish the penny . economic : each penny costs 1.7 cents to make , putting the government ( further ) into debt . inflation had caused the penny to drop in value , and it will only continue to do so . many studies have shown that abolishing the penny would not decrease the amount of change donated to charity . patriotic : abraham lincoln would probably not want want the government going into debt for the sole purpose of remembering him , also , he is on the five dollar bill .","it would certainly help us out a little with our debt problem if it costs so much to print/produce coins . the only argument that i 've seen that has any kind of validity is that the gamability of rounding is exacerbated by our weird system in the u.s. of having sales tax that varies by county and even by city ( or smaller area ) in some situations . rounding to the nearest nickel is possible , though slightly tricky since it 's an odd number ... x.x8 through x.x2 - > nearest 0 , x.x3 through x.x7 - > nearest 5 . however , it 's 5 times as "" gameable "" by setting prices so that your tax always rounds up for the most common purchases , which turns into a motivation for differential pricing in different locations . furthermore , there 's exactly zero reason to do this for credit card transactions , which are an increasing majority of all purchases in the us . "" each penny costs 1.7 cents to make , putting the government ( further ) into debt . "" we could easily decide that pennies are so useful that they would be worth $ 25 per coin to produce . all that "" debt "" is , for a currency issuing entity , when it is denominated in the currency it issues , is the result of money creation . but it is merely a liability to pay that money back from the taxes it will receive at a later date . the government goes into so called debt , with itself , when it creates money , and goes out of debt when it destroys the money that it created after receiving it back in tax money , so the notion that the government should go out of debt at some point is functionally equivalent to saying "" the government should tax more money out of the economy than it puts into the economy until there is no money left in the economy . "" in reality , running deficits is absolutely essential to a growing economy , since growth in the value of goods and services is deflationary to prices , so you need to inflate the supply of currency at the rate at which the value of goods and services increases in order to have no deflation , and you need to spend even more money into the economy to maintain low inflation . taxes are essential , not because they fund government spending , and the fact that they create their own deflationary pressure is its own bonus , but they are essential as they create a use value for dollars : as "" ... legal tender for all debts public ... "" , a phrase that you will find on every single federal reserve note in existence . i agree with you that creating pennies is bad , but not because we have to print money to pay for their production , but because we literally have to print more money to create them than there is value in the money we printed ( or minted , in this case ) , and they fail to facilitate any meaningful degree of commerce . when we print money , either on a literal printing press or on computers in the central bank , we should spend it on goods and services that create the most amount of happiness in peoples lives per dollar spent , and pennies do not do that . abolishing the penny would make people who hold any significant amount angry . eventually businesses would not be able to have enough pennies to make change so they would just raise their prices to make them unnecessary , bypassing the government . the penny , or ' cent ' is the basic unit of money for amounts less then a dollar . how can you have a basic unit that does n't exist ."
9usvqh,"we can get offended by media or ideas all we want , but we should never advocate suppression of those ideas or deletion of that media introduction and background this notion comes from our ever-changing world where government-based laws and social motivated consequences are beginning to have life-changing impacts . social media allows a level of transparency that has never been seen before , and unlike government-based legislation , it is much less measured and does not attempt to construct clear metrics for how those consequences are calculated . as such , we when we express our views and opinions , we should be empathetic in the criticisms we cast and measured in the advocacies we push . as more and more individuals choose to start revolutions through social media in order to enact change , i believe that we should never advocate to reduce , suppress , cancel , or disincentivize others from engaging with media , art , ideas , or philosophical values of any kind . caveats in some ways this belief may sound like an advocacy that says there should be full transparency of information , but it 's actually more about preventing the suppression of information that consenting creators want available in the public domain . this is an advocacy of artists and philosophers to spread ideas they want in the public sphere . personal information should be one 's choice to share , and the discussion of multiple consenting parties spreading information , or even a journalist ’s right to share information is not my intention with this discussion . i believe that is a complex consent discussion , but ultimately side-steps an creator ’s initial wish to share their art publically . bold claims and philosophy it ’s not too absurd to state that censorship is a problem , but many believe that some values/ideas should be prohibited because they cause harm . i do n’t believe any idea , art , or idea should be buried from the public eye . not only should no media/art/ideas be suppressed , but the discouraging act of saying "" you should n't even experience this "" is not in line with promoting progression or critical thinking . regarding media , it extends to something innocuous like one 's beloved series/franchise getting yet another remake ( "" how dare they remake dragonball z in live action again ?! "" ) , to something more controversial ( "" how dare they remake the lincoln biopic portraying denzel washington in white makeup ?! "" ) , to more purposefully dangerous and even intentionally malicious ideologies ( "" mein kampf "" , "" the anarchists cookbook "" , or some clear-cut how-to on murder/warfare ) . if one is actively offended by either example , that 's one 's absolute right to feel emotion . emotional experience should even be encouraged , as it also helps us grow as individuals . but one should be able to consent to knowing what they may experience before they experience it ... that is the whole purpose behind consent in the first place – to be informed of what they agree to engage in . one 's revulsion means one can turn away from it , or encourage a discussion about it ... but it should never lead to a campaign or petition to ban that artwork/idea . it 's not absolved from critique , because that art may cause actual harm and damage ... but that manifests a discussion of that damage and consequence , not the media , which acts to simply inform others of ideas and does not cause physical harm . mental harm is possible and viewers should consent to experiencing things knowing that certain emotions may be elicited ( this is n’t unlike the mpaa , which informs viewers about acts of violence , profanity , sex , or anything generally consTrued as “ mature ” content consenting adults should be informed of ) . practical examples to begin bringing it to practical examples , a person who murders another person after playing gta is at fault because they murdered someone . gta is not at fault for providing access to ideas . when the media suppresses news about public suicides in an attempt to prevent suicide in the populace , they are attempting to prevent harm , but also reducing the discussion one may encourage around suicide . if a person commits suicide after a piece of media , the consequence of suicide , lack of support , and burgeoning irrationality around the act of suicide deserve more attention , not less . in extreme examples that have some sort of media or idea that has a reasonable likelihood that it might make a person a non-consenting person ( some sci-fi brainwashing machine that strips you of your autonomy ) does not apply because the media must have come with enough informed consent to let an engager know “ this may cause you to commit crimes , which you alone will be responsible for ” . in this same vein , a knife has an implicit amount of “ informed consent ” that it is sharp , and when may fatally puncture one ’s jugular . the behavior and action still reside with the user of the tool . extreme example thought experiment suicidal ideation is a real issue , and there ’s some evidence to suggest that reporting on suicide may lead to more suicide . let ’s take this to the extreme for a thought experiment , shall we ? let 's say that with 100 % consistency , a “ special ” sci-fi picture of suicide makes one commit suicide . well , a forced exposure of that image is then 100 % murder . if a person is forced to commit suicide because they were non-consensually exposed to that image , that 's the exact same thing as intentional murder . that 's a break of consent . it 's a break of consent , because you did n't allow that person to consent to that image , which 100 % leads to suicide . if we have a reasonable belief that this exposure has a 5 % likelihood ( or really any % ) could lead to suicide , we need to inform users of what they are about to expose themselves to in order to consent . because i believe consenting adults can choose their right to die , the 100 % suicide-image should still be able to exist , but what matters is that we allow users to consent to this exposure . what one may garner from this example is that the art itself is never the issue . the issue is a mismatch of informed consent to expose oneself to a piece of art , and the criticizable thing being the consequences arising from said exposure . my message here is n’t just that “ censorship is bad ” , it ’s that “ encouraging the suppression of art , which itself is freedom of speech , needs to be carefully done "" , and done in a way that allows more informed consent about exposure to art/media/ideas , rather than less . this is because discouraging access is in a way , a reduction of information that would lead to informed consent . conclusion i believe that the active suppression and even desire to suppress ideas and thoughts and media is very dangerous . many may want to create “ exemptions ” like propaganda ( forced exposure to media ) , horribly insensitive topics ( racist ideologies and ways to incite them ) , or other ideas i ask you posters to help me identify , but i believe that the attempt to remove any single idea from engagement removes our ability to consent to experience in the first place . by encouraging any suppression of media for everyone to access ( "" the avatar movie should never have been made ! "" or "" the communist manifesto deserves no cognitive consideration , and no one should ever see it "" ) , we reduce growth and target ideas rather than actions , and that 's one of the least progressive advocacies we could encourage . tl ; dr if someone advocates to suppress , delete , or cancel media/thoughts/ideas from having public visibility , they remove the ability to have a discourse about that media and actively discourage growth and progressive thought about it . when someone says an artist or philosopher can not express their complex ideas , they prevent viewers from being able to consent to said material and take away the ability for mature audiences to engage in an assessment of those ideas . with ideas one disagrees with , instead , there should be more active discussion to help others illuminate their values , and thus have society more aligned on ethical values and moving towards a place where society has more empathy , sees more eye to eye , and in general agrees what it means to consent to one another and better understand one another . caveat : this discussion is not an attempt to identify who can consent , or when a consenting adult enters a moment that disables their consent . that is a pretty lofty discussion and deserves its own intense philosophical aims .","what if you created two parallel earths , in one , the world ends within 50 years because and in the other it 's utopia . the only difference is in one world , nothing is suppressed , and in the utopia world , some extremely harmful and/or False things are suppressed . since most of our methods of media and communication are via privately owned businesses , it 's within a business 's right to control the dialog within it . and that 's been shown with the removal of distasteful subreddits and videos . it 's heavily moderated with jokes , poor responses , and unsourced speculation being removed at a very quick pace . i would say no because the subreddit 's mission is to provide informed responses with sufficient evidence in a serious environment . your cmv deals a lot with the consent of the artist and the viewer , but what if there is a subject to that art ? for example , an artist creating a piece of art Falsely depicting a real person as a pedophile ."
9usk5m,"it ’s the government ’s responsibility to restrict hate speech to be clear , hate speech is speech that “ attacks a person or group on the basis of attributes such as race , religion , ethnic origin , national origin , sex , disability , sexual orientation , or gender identity . ” i believe we would all agree that it ’s the government ’s duty to build the most ideal society . part of that duty is restricting or banning things deemed dangerous or unhealthy for society . hate speech is one of those things , and the government should do everything in its power to stop its spread . with growing hate movements in europe and america i believe it ’s more essential than ever for fascism to be stopped . what if we lose ? how many of innocent lives would be lost then ? the state must be willing to fight back . this would mean breaking up nazi protests , banning neo-nazi publications , and putting economic sanctions on companies who enable hate speech . i have heard that adding these restrictions would create a “ slippery slope ” into fascism . but this is lofty and insubstantial . things like seditious speech and child pornography are punishable by many months of jail time in america . other countries , such as germany , have already adopted anti-fascist laws . though there have been isolated cases of misapplication of those laws , there has been no visible “ snowball effect ” where those laws have been frequently utilized to silence opposition . 1 . demonstration of consistent misapplication and abuse in regions that have adopted hate speech laws 2 . demonstration that hate speech laws are n't useful at combating hateful ideologies","if you support these groups , then the prohibition on hate speech would end them . the reason hate speech should not be illegal is because hate speech laws are literal forms of thought control . i keep hearing people argue that hate speech laws would have prevented hitler from starting wwii . there are many laws , if followed , that would have prevented wwii . hitler grew to power through exceptional means , broke laws , and used the government 's abilities to control speech to seize enough power to start a war . any attack on that group that is based on their religion would be hate speech . the entire idea of making hate speech illegal is horrendous . some people believe the governments duty is to ensure the rights , freedoms , and sovergnty of its people . if the government is trying to build or direct the way society functions then that is government overreach . putting vauge restrictions on one of the most foundational rights of our society , free speech , would certainly qualify . i think its society 's job to punish people for hateful speech . now replace fascism with islam , which contains a system of laws that includes killing gays and extracting more tax from jews than from muslims . even if it starts to gain power like it did through the taliban and isis ? they were n't just some random groups of terrorists , they were fundamentalist muslims following mohammed 's words as accurately as they could . the problem here is "" attack "" seems to be treated as a subjective term nowadays ( "" microaggressions "" ) , which means people can ( and have been ) call any criticism "" hate speech "" , and just about any issue can be turned into a matter of race , disability , or sex in some way or other . feminism can be perceived as an attack on men , affirmative action can be perceived as an attack on whites , etc. and hence feminist speech can be considered hate speech toward men , speech denouncing racism can be considered hate speech toward whites , etc . i do n't trust the government enough to let it define and delimit hate speech right now , without the need for a slippery slope . i live in austria and you would have to walk in ss uniform screaming heil hitler to get charged for that and let me tell you there is few countries that take hate crime more serious than germany and austria . nazis here walk with prussian and imperial german flags , change one word in known neo-nazi phrases and continue on . i also would n't agree that its the governments duty to build the most ideal society , i believe it is the governments job to ensure that individuals are given the opportunity to innovate and create their ideal society . no government should have the power to determine the most ideal society , as that is a subjective philosophy . we may agree on many of the same things that comprise the most ideal society , but we could also easily disagree . if we disagreed , and my point of view was viewed as inflammatory to the party in power , which also changes frequently , am i now a criminal ? outside of criminal proceedings , there are an increasing number of cases in the united states that are stemming from hr policies that combat "" discrimination "" and "" hate speech . "" the problem with misapplication and abuse is built into the idea of a hate speech law . in order to draft such a law , you must first believe that hate speech is a problem that ought to be criminalized . hate speech laws are n't useful at combating hateful ideologies in the sense that hateful ideologies are n't rooted in speech . they may be manifested in speech or writing , but they begin as thoughts . when you have the conversation , it is n't so easy to determine where the line is . one thought is clearly less eloquent and constructive , but nevertheless , both of them question the value of islam . does an ideology become hateful when it is a stereotype that is n't rooted in facts and statistics , or those facts and statistics are weak ? i think everyone can agree that hate speech is bad , and should be regarded as bad . however , i think it is very easy to determine in the previous examples , which statements are purposefully hateful and not constructive to society , and which statements raise a potentially valuable conversation that addresses a problem . it is far worse to handicap the vocabulary of the majority trying to have a conversation , than to allow hateful ideologies that may negatively influence the minority . the people espousing hate speech when uttered in public , are and ought to be scrutinized , criticized and ostracized to a degree which might encourage them to rethink their positions . part of me thinks that the most powerful way to combat harmful ideas is with the truth , not with violence ( which is what the speech laws are ultimately a form of ) . part of me does worry about who gets to decide what hate speech is , and how far that can go . how do you know whether i genuinely hate the target of my speech , or if i 'm just using off-color humor , or humor in a context you simply do n't understand ? what happens if he arbitrarily decrees that the phrase "" russian investigation "" is racist , and therefore bans the media from talking about it ? i think that the biggest flaw in your argument is assuming that the governments job is to define and impose sanctions to make the world better . there 's mountains of empirical evidence that both of those things are not only bad for the individual but society as a whole . nazism is bad ( obvious to me ) , but so is something like the anti-vax movement , the extreme left ( extremes in general are bad with this kinda stuff ) , or religion for that matter , considering the overwhelming amount of violence historically speaking it has caused . that being said our society is n't all on the same page and thus our government can not ban things like that . however we do set forth mitigation on the things that we have condoned as a society . we as a unit do n't trust our government enough to forfeit freedom of speech , but we have decided inciting violence is wrong as well as discrimination based on your inherent person ( which we continue to flush out the definition of ) . in the perfect world we would have a society enough on the same page that hate speech would not even be a thing , because we 've picked a set of values that represents the ethical collective that is our society . the extreme right , as well as the extreme left are the parts of society that challenge what our current ethical consensus is ."
9us23g,"as long as people are provided with free access to the bare minimum needed to survive , a free market economy can exist without being exploitative . reposting because i poorly worded my view in the title of my last post . i believe that workers are only exploited when a person needs to settle for a job that pays them unfairly , or else face starvation , becoming homeless , not being able to provide for their family , etc. . in this case , the worker has no choice but to take this low paying job , and the employer has every incentive to offer them as low a wage as they want , because the worker could either take that wage , or starve . if , even without working , a person could survive but ultimately live an unfulfilling life with just the bare minimum , then they have a choice in every job offer . this allows for a mutual agreement to be reached between the employer and the employee , or if an agreement is not reached , both parties can go to each other 's competition , meaning a different employer for the employee that is willing to offer a higher wage , or a different employee for the employer willing to work for a lower wage . it is this opportunity that will allow for fair wages to be determined , influenced by how much value both parties provide for each other . i like the idea of universal basic income to achieve this , at the bare minimum needed to buy necessities , so if you do n't choose to spend that money on necessities , you face not being able to afford these necessities .","they exploit us through advertising , convincing us we need things we do n’t need and have problems we do n’t have , harvesting our lives for data to better manipulate us . they exploit our environment and natural resources . they poison the earth the water and the air , destroying the future to feast on the spoils today . in the same way , there is no such thing as an economy that is n't exploitative , because someone will always consider themselves to be treated unfairly . the problem here is that there are certain human drives - basically the upper half of maslow 's hierarchy of needs , things like self-actualization and sexual satisfaction - basically ca n't be met with just the bare necessities . you 're very unlikely to find a mate if you 're at the bottom of the social ladder ; you 're very unlikely to be treated with respect or have any self-respect if you 're at the bottom of the social ladder . as a result everyone will still have to strive and compete . historically , extreme income inequality has a strong correlation to the development of fascism . so just giving people the minimum would likely leave society vulnerable to this sort of development . extreme income inequality has to also be addressed , so the market should n't be allowed to just do what it does ( consolidates wealth over time ) . when workers sign an employment contract with a capitalist , they are giving up autonomy and ability to perform labor to the capitalist in exchange for using their privately owned means of production to create something of value , only a little of which workers get to keep as wages . the unfairness is n't so much that workers do n't get all the value they create , because well that 's just the system . if they got all the value , a business could n't make profit . the real unfairness is that while you have the freedom to take on a job you get an offer for , you do n't have the freedom to not do that . yes , ubi can solve this by giving free money to survive . but it does n't end the inherent exploitation of wage labor . and i do n't know exactly if businesses would react by treating the extra money a worker gets in wages as a luxury above survival , in which case they might keep a tighter hand on every dollar above the survival rate , pushing exploitation of labor higher . a capitalist market depends on the existence of wage labor , so a capitalist market will always be exploitative . the concept of a person receiving ' the bare minimum to survive ' is not found anywhere in nature . the fundamental reality of life on this planet is that there some basic fundamental level of personal responsibility to ensure ones own survival . i 'll give you a hint , jobs in the modern world are a lot less work than subsistence living . therefore the argument needs to be framed in how to structure said job market . we can start at a basic trade example with the idea of mutual beneficial exchange or barter between parties . we then move to specialization with traded skills for money - a medium of exchange with specific value . we still have to have the mutually beneficial relationship where both parties get something positive out of the arrangement . that means by default , the ' worker ' will never get full value for the work produced for an 'em ployer ' because the 'em ployer ' has to see benefit for being in this arrangement . i guess i get your point -- if people are given the bare essentials with no strings attached , they are in a better bargaining position -- but mere survival on the bare minimum still seems like a nasty , brutish , and short life . so , despite the playing field being slightly more level , i think fairly likely the workers of the world would still be coerced into "" agreeing "" to unfair terms . how do we make sense of that ? how is this change in definition not merely a bald faced attempt at defending the injustices capitalism seems to necessitate ? counter example : a person wants to have as many children as possible and never work . the person plays with the kids in the park when the kids are free and when the kids are at school the person goes to the library and reads a book . if not , given there has never been an economy with a national ubi , do you think every economy that has ever existed has been exploitative ? i 'm pretty sure that 's the basis of "" minimum wage "" ."

9uqq5x,"transexuality reinforces toxic gender roles i 'll start this off with my definition of transexuality . so transexuality refers to a condition known as gender dysphoria , in which a person feels like their born or assigned gender matches the gender they personally identify as . so , how does it reinforce toxic gender roles ? well , if someone who is born woman and is struggling with identity issues and says , "" i feel like a man , not a woman "" . my biggest question is , what does that mean ? how do you define a man ? how do you define a woman ? is a man supposed to be the macho rough and tough , do or die , mud covered , big truck driving stoic ? is n't it wrong to attach traits to a certain sex and say if you want to go out of the norm , you arent a man/woman ? perhaps that same man wants to paint his nails , where a dress , and watch some chick flicks . does that make him less of a man ? i 'd even go as far to say that there is n't actually a distinction between gender and sex . simply put , people are who they are , and despite what they look like or like doing , they are who they are , and that 's okay . you want to get breast augmentations or a double mastectomy ? there is nothing wrong with that . you want do do things that break the traditional gender roles ? hell yeah , power to you . but you should n't have to change yourself to fit into another end of the toxic gender roles . you can simply be who you are and if anyone does n't like it , that 's the problem we should address . this is just the way i 've been seeing it and i do n't really say it because it 's probably not that popular of a thing to say . which means maybe i got something wrong . feel free to poke some holes in my theory . change my view .","women and men are categorically different in their behavior , so much so that is benefits us to assign labels to the behavior to further understand gender differences . when a trans person wants to be the other sex , it 's because they see the way that sex behaves and is treated by the rest of the world , and their mind compels them to flock to that gender . i think jeffree starr is a perfect example of a man who defies male roles but is still presenting as a man and is not trans . so there are people like jeffree who like things that are not considered masculine , and it does n't make them less male . but when a trans person has all of those interests plus the hormonal imbalance and the brain activity of the opposite sex , it 's a different case . ignoring the typo ( i think you meant to say "" does n't match "" ) , this is n't an accurate definition of being transgender or gender dysphoria . being transgender is ( roughly ) the condition of having a gender identity that does not match your sex . gender dysphoria specifically refers to clinically significant distress associated with such a mismatch of gender and sex . it is possible to be transgender and not suffer gender dysphoria , perhaps because you 're cool as ice , or because you 've transitioned to a level you find acceptable , or what have you . i 've never seen a trans individual say that men doing feminine things make them "" less of a man "" , for example . and all of your examples are about behaviors , while trans people tend to talk about a deeper feeling of identity associated with their body itself and their overall presentation ( again , this is broad and i 'm not speaking for all trans people ) . the latter half of this is basically agreeing with how trans people typically argue for acceptance of people breaking traditional gender roles . even if you believe we ought to have no such thing as gender roles , the practical reality is that society treats gender mostly as a binary and that binary has a huge influence over our lives . and since gender has such a huge influence on people 's lives , linking it to sex does little but hurt trans people now , and we can say that 's bad even while also arguing that people should , as a whole , not judge people for actions that do n't fit gender stereotypes . they are basing it on what they are feeling . they were born with a brain that 's like those of the opposite sex and thus they also feel like it . toxic gender roles ... this is a tough one , because a lot of people ( majority , actually ) actually like and enjoy these gender roles . yes it 's a gender role , but it 's also something that i like . if an assigned woman wants to be a man , in the definition that i just gave , then so be it . we should not be focusing our efforts on telling transgender peoples to accept their assigned gender and accept being different . we should be focusing our efforts on letting everyone else know that there are all kinds of men and women and other , and it just should not matter in the end . people paradoxically seem to need both acceptance and distinction ; they need to feel like they are recognized as belonging to the traditional whole , but they also need to feel like they are an individual that ca n't be reduced to a stereotype . if you have always had that basic recognition and acceptance , chances are that your only concern is individuation , i.e. how can you stand out from the crowd , how can you make unique contributions to the group . from this perspective , it is going to seem strange that other people seem to want to be labeled as belonging to a certain identity . but what you are probably missing is that establishing the identity label is only step one , moving on to being a unique individual is step two . the end goal for transexuals or any group is n't to be completely reduced to that label , but to get a baseline acceptance of that label in society so that they can just be individual people like anyone else wants to be . first , you seem to be fundamentally misunderstanding the source of gender dysphoria for many if not most trans people . i am not trans because i “ feel masculine ” or “ feel like a boy ” or “ like masculine things ” . in fact , i ’m very feminine in a lot of ways . i am friends with mostly girls , i like feminine tv and movies , i like makeup and jewelry . but there is a fundamental disconnect between how my brain perceives my body and how my body is actually shaped . but imagine you looked in the mirror , and your body was shaped like the other sex . say you are a cis male : you look in the mirror , and you have breasts and a vagina , despite being able to feel a flat chest and a penis . the breasts look misplaced , they do n’t look like a part of your body , it feels like they are irregular growths that you should be able to remove . you feel a phantom penis , but you do n’t have one , and the reminder that it is missing ( either due to lack of a bulge in your clothes or from not feeling it between your legs ) is uncomfortable or even disturbing . i also have those feelings of discomfort with my lack of facial hair ( it feels like i should have it , but my face is bare ) . the things i need to do to alleviate my dysphoria are to take hormone therapy , which will make facial and body hair grow and darken , will lower my voice , and make my body fat redistribute . say , “ actually , i was born with a vagina , so call me she instead ” even though at the most basic sense of the word , eliminating all socially constructed roles for gender expression , i am still male ? the truth is that if i were born with the body i need to be comfortable , the body my brain already perceives me to have , i would have been assigned male at birth . you say “ gender roles are socially constructed , you do n’t need this kind of body to like these kinds of things ” . i do n’t think “ i ’m masculine and i better fit this social role , so i ’m going to modify my body and go by different pronouns so it ’s socially acceptable ” . when people treat me like a girl , or misgender me , what that does is remind me that my body is n’t shaped right , and that causes my dysphoria to flare . like i said , i do n’t identify as male because i ’m masculine , i do so because the correct body for myself is one that is socially perceived to be male . if i were living alone on a deserted island , i would still feel uncomfortable in my body and need surgery and hormones . if i were living in a “ genderless ” society ( ie , a society without gender roles ) , i would still need surgery and hormones to feel comfortable . society reinforces harmful gender roles , and punishes trans people for not conforming to them , so many trans people do end up conforming to gender roles to escape being attacked and discriminated against . a reminder that trans women get harassed and publicly mocked if they show up in public with a strong jawline or visible facial hair . that for the last 30 years or more , trans people were n’t allowed the life-saving hormones and surgery they needed unless they conformed to extremely strict gender roles because if they

9uqnqv,"for many people , voting is not a rational way to express your policy preferences for example , i went to a catholic school for many years , and my views have in great part been informed by catholicism , which tends towards what americans call social conservatism ( anti-abortion , traditionalism , relatively traditional conceptions of sex and gender , etc ) and economically liberal ( strong protections for the poor , open to immigrants , multiculturalism ) . my views are not , of course , entirely based on the teachings of the church , and i diverge in a few ways . for example , i am in favor of contraception , would n't outlaw abortion although i am skeptical of it , etc problem : neither of the parties map onto my policy preferences in their entirety or anywhere close to it . the republican party has a better stance on many social issues in my opinion , but its free market economics is destructive of traditional forms of culture and labor rights , its rhetoric is often tinged with racism , and is disdainful of the poor . democrats tend to call for stronger labor protections and favor the poor and minorities , but they have aligned themselves with what i consider radical social movements that do not conform to my view of human nature , and are also destructive to the more traditional conception of life and culture that i value . sure , i could vote for either party out of protest against the other . but the leaders of the other party will not be able to gain an intelligent understanding for why i rejected them because their platforms consist of a bundle of ideas . if i vote for a democrat , it is not likely that the republicans will know that i , a single voter of millions , rejected them because they do not support labor , even while i want them to remain socially conservative . there is absolutely no telling how they will internalize my voting against them . indeed , the dems might think i voted for them because i support their social liberalism , even though i did so because i support their stronger labor policies . ultimately , i reject the platforms of both for a number of reasons , even while i affirm wholeheartedly other policies that they promote . but there is no simple balancing here , where i can weigh out pros and cons on a scale and choose a "" lesser evil "" . both are , in my view , unpalatably "" evil "" , just along different axes . therefore , i have effectively been disenfranchised by the lack of worthwhile politicians to vote for , and to vote for either might send a message that i support one or the other , when in reality i do not . it is rational for me not to vote for a party that is not in any way responsive to my needs . & #x200b ; tldr : when neither party is likely to be responsive to my policy preferences and are unable to understand the reason for my voting for one or the other , it is rational to vote for neither when either will further ends that i consider to be destructive .","if you do n't like the option you have to vote in , your should vote someone else in in the primary . if you do n't like the options you have in the primary , you should vote in smaller and more local politics , as primary candidates are generally drawn from successful and popular local politicians that move their way up . if you do n't like your options you have in local politics , vote for someone else in those primaries . but then you have to get up and fix it -- hire a contractor , do it yourself , who cares just get it taken care of . in a normal setting , i 'd point out that you express your nuanced reasons for support with a call to our representative and you enforce that call with your vote . voter id laws are designed to reduce democrat voter access . and the voting record demonstrates the gop is engaged in a war to keep voting rights and security receeding . obama ( d ) – 8 years in office and 0 indictments or sentences . tens of millions spent and 30 yrs of claiming them the most corrupt ever and there was exactly one person convicted of a crime . i hope you 'll vote for some checks on the gop this go around . if your views are balanced across both sides of the aisle then you can vote for the party that is in the minority at the time . picture a senate that is perfectly 50/50 , any legislation passing would require a much more moderate view in order to garner support from the opposing party ( i know this will not hold for every individual issue but across the greater landscape it will ) . so the way you view is expressed is not necessarily by your individual vote but rather by your entire voting history . it ’s always more rational to vote for this reason : the problem for you is , one of them is going to win . one of them is going to make law and policy that affects your life . or do you pick the one you disagree with on a lot of stuff , but can agree with on a few things ? the rational option is always to try to tilt the scale towards the person that will harm your personal agenda the least . you 're in a rare minority in america , in the sense that you 're fiscally liberal but culturally conservative . it 's basically impossible for either party to target you , because neither could do so without alienating the majority of their base . what i 'd argue is that you need to abandon your culturally conservative principles . those principles are moral guidelines in your own life , but you really are being hypocritical to force those same principles on others by voting for socially conservative politicians . bottom line is , you can keep "" your own "" socially conservative stance on life , and do n't have to surrender it by voting for socially progressive candidates . you ca n't hold on to your fiscally liberal views and vote for candidates who want to fuel our economy on the blood of the poor . each of us can choose each day how we conduct ourselves morally , but none of us can choose what kind of economy we live in , except by voting . if i 'm in your shoes , i 'd rather be a socially conservative guy living in a socially progressive world with a strong social safety net , than be a stubborn socially conservative guy living in a plutocracy that i helped enable . i think it ’s important to assess what you hope will come out of your vote from a policy and action perspective . i can understand that you value traditional social norms but am unclear on what you ’d like to see happen from a social policy perspective . you said that you are n’t against the availability of birth control , do n’t necessarily want to see abortion become illegal , are n’t against gay people being allowed to marry and have “ reservations ” about trans people but i ’m not understanding what you do want in terms of policy/laws as it relates to these issues . what are some examples of some policies that you think republicans could give you that support your conservative social stance ? i ’d argue that the ship has already sailed in terms of a more liberal social society , regardless of who is in office . women are n’t going back to staying at home to make babies and sandwiches , gay/trans people are n’t going back in the closet to hide their identities and as we become a more diverse nation , the social clout of christianity will probably continue to be eroded . i ca n’t think of a single modern example of social progressivism being willingly back peddled by the people of a country . so basically , i think you ’re giving up meaningful economic policy that actually could happen and improve the lives of lots of people ( like minimum wage increases , healthcare etc. . for a dream of preserving traditionalist values in a society that has largely already rejected them and moved on . agree to spend election day in each others company ( to guarantee neither votes ) and enjoy life . have you considered voting for third party candidates ? sure they have virtually zero chance of winning , but major parties pay attention to third parties that garner significant numbers of votes — for example if once reliable republican voters start jumping ship for libertarianism , the party might try to appeal to those lost voters next cycle by keeping their economic policies similar but becoming maybe more liberal on some social policies . also , know that the major parties keep track of who votes . we are often forced to pick between the lesser of two evils . i believe this is endemic to a two party system as they both strive to get 51 % of the electorate on their side by trading out planks in their platform . you just happen to be in that middle where half the issues you care about are being championed by each side . very few people can point to one party and say they agree 100 % . not even the candidates running are 100 % in line with their party platforms . if you really want your voice heard with more nuance than a binary choice , then you 're going to have to participate more . a public commissioner is n't going to have much influence over social issues . a probate judge may not have much influence over economic issues ( i 'm not as confident on this claim ) . you may have strong disagreements with candidates , but still be able to shoehorn them into positions where they will mostly only have responsibilities over issues you agree with them in . op i empathize with your point of view , and i reject the idea of "" vote anyway "" . if there is n't a candidate you align with , you have the absolute right to reserve your vote . it 's not your duty to vote , it 's a candidate 's privilege to receive it . i believe in a situation where neither major party puts forward a suitable candidate you have exactly zero responsibility to vote for the mildly less offensive one . and imo , the people that continue to vote "" just to vote "" perpetuate the problem . my experience is nearly nobody is fully aligned with all ( or even most ) policies of a single party . nearly everyone i know usually will admit neither major party candidate is particularly compelling , in nearly every race . never feel as if you 're wasting it on a third party if you 're voting your concience . do n't waste your vote just because you see a lot of people posting stickers on facebook ."
9upzn1,"the party system in the u.s. is deleterious to politics as a whole . as today is voting day , i have been bombarded with , "" you have to vote ! / your vote counts ! / you have no right to complain if you do n't vote ! "" i want to want to vote , but the problem is i do not feel like i can vote for what i believe in , but rather against what i do not believe . & #x200b ; my reasoning for this is that unless i vote republican or democrat my vote is essentially the same as if i did not vote . in my mind this is because there are too many people who just vote with their party because it is , "" their team . "" the amount of people i heard during the presidential elections saying "" i 'm voting trump/hillary just because it is n't hillary/trump "" was astounding . they did n't like the candidate they were voting for or agree with a lot of what they were saying but they still voted for them because they did n't want to lose . voting should not be like that , people should be voting for the person that will actually work for what they want to happen . additionally with the two party system , options are cut out early in primaries because neither party can push forward multiple candidates because it separates the vote and ensures that the other party wins . while i am in no way familiar with the intricacies of politics , it seems like having no parties , or at least a greater number of parties , would be better . by having only two "" viable "" parties it becomes a battle of two extremes , rather than a selection across a spectrum of views . political views , while often related , are not cut and dry , there are too many individual things to look at for two parties to encompass the range of views . & #x200b ; i realize many of my points have been said with the presidential election in mind however i do believe that they are still mostly relevant to the election this year as well .","the only way to actually get to multiple parties is by using a different voting system , like rank choice . as long as we have the current voting structure , any "" no party "" system will inevitably develop parties , because they make you win more , and any multi-party system will inevitably winnow away the excess parties , because those excess parties make your side lose more . as is , unless you vote republican or democrat , your vote is , in fact , pretty much a non-vote . we should push towards a system that incentivizes more parties , but we must contend with the basic reality before us . so , vote for one of the two teams , and support efforts that would make more teams possible . see , i think political parties get a lot of the blame and they do deserve it to a certain degree . the primaries are for weeding out multiple candidates and to give the party the best chance to win . mathematically , it makes sense to get as a big a team as you can afford to compromise on and 3rd party candidates exclusively act as spoilers . maine just switched to a system that destroys the two party system by requiring any "" winner "" to actually get 50 % of the vote . if no one does , candidates that are mathematically eliminated are removed and a run off vote happens where people who voted for a loser , get to transfer their vote to their second choice . americans over rate the value of third parties , what they really want is a party that aligns with them on more issues . there 's a popular position amongst dissatisfied pundits that what this country really needs is a ' libertarian ' party that is more progressive socially ( abortion , gay marriage , ) and has light touch regulation , but that 's just because people with those views are disproportionately represented in the media elite that they brush shoulders with . if you actually ask rank and file voters you find that what people really want is for people to follow traditional morality ( however that voter defines it for themselves ) and also a government that prevents the factory from polluting the water and for their food and drugs to be clean . but what you find is by introducing more parties you actually introduce more gridlock . you sort of see this today with the modern gop where you have an uncooperative coalition of very conservative house members that acts almost as a coalition partner might in europe to veto anything the more moderate senate could get through . a True third third party will have even less incentive to cooperate further introducing gridlock . game theory actually predicts the opposite that if there are only two parties candidates should move as close to the center as they possibly can while retaining their extreme flanks in order to pick up as many moderate voters as they can . you 've observed that in the american system the opposite is happening but that 's because of the way individual candidates are selected . america has very low turnout primary elections where the only people who turn out are highly partisans and so the primary campaigns are dedicated to who can soak up as many of those voters as they can . you saw this a lot during the tea party wave where moderate incumbents would lose to extreme primary challengers and then either that challenger would lose a winnable seat or they 'd win and become a stick in the mud to that party 's leadership . in summary what you really want is some sort of ranked voting solution , or some sort of finger on the scale in the primaries that hurts fringe candidates or helps centrist candidates ."
9up6qg,"it 's voting day in the us . democrat or republican you get the same economic policy with a different social policy and for that reason nothing will get better . democrats : left leaning social policies and more support for safety nets . economic policy is to serve the corporate masters but to a less extreme than the republicans . republicans : right leaning social policies that focus more on control at any cost mostly through fear mongering and misinformation . economic policy is to serve corporate masters to the extreme . -- url -- for the record i voted straight ticket dem because at least while i 'm not getting fair wages , healthcare , and proper taxation of the rich i might get slightly more enjoyable social policies and freedoms . the article i linked above explains why i feel this way . corporations have a 35 % tax rate which is already far too low . the r 's control most branches of government and slash it to 21 . now the d 's claim via schumer when they take back control they will raise it to 25 % . so effectively we gave them a 10 % tax credit on already too low taxes not to mention the loop holes . is this the best i can hope for ? racists that rob me and the workers or people that allow some progressive policy and still rob the workers ? please change my view .","even though major political movements generally take years , our revolution is already electing more progressives and a couple notorious examples of democratic socialists ( pedants may call them socdems instead , for the purposes of your cmv i do n't feel the distinction matters ) . the democrat party is n't where you want it to be , but it is moving in that direction , while the republican party is probably moving in the exact opposite direction . economists widely agree the corporate income tax is n't a good tax , as all it does is stifle growth . if you want to tax the rich , tax the rich . furthermore , the united states currently has a higher statutory , average , and effective corporate tax rate than countries such as germany , france , australia , and canada according to the cbo as of 2012 . if you think corporations should pay more taxes instead of less , then you certainly ca n’t also believe that democrats and republicans have even remotely similar economic policies . well , the democrats could certainly be doing better along these lines , but i think there 're a few meaningful improvements associated with the democrat party line as applies to economics . for one thing , this crazy trump trade war thing is decidedly economically harmful without directly coming from corporate tax rates . his push towards expansionary economic policy during a time of reasonable growth could prove disastrous . and , of course , the attack on regulations could have a lot of negative economic externalities , the specifics dependent on the regulation . either an issue is economic , in which case it must necessarily be related to this one admittedly super important aspect of policy , or it 's social , and thus not related to economics . but there are many less critical economic policies , and even some more "" social "" policies that have economic impact ."
9uovv0,"hierarchal structures are not necessary for a practical society background : i was having a conversations with some friends about societal structures . the conversation got to a point where someone was arguing for capitalism being more practical than socialism . i do n't want to get into the spiral of socialism versus capitalism because i believe both structures are not ideal as they both require a hierarchy of power to keep the system in place ( at least as to how they have been implemented up until now ) . thus , it allows the people at the top of the hierarchy to abuse their position , creating unfairness to some percentage of the people if the people at the top decide to take advantage of their position . anyways i spoke this point into the conversation and one of my friends disagreed saying that a hierarchy is necessary because this is how society was , is , and will be . when i come to think about it , yes , that is how it has always been . for good reason too , without this hierarchy we would have not survived 200,000 years . after all , we 're social creatures and this is where our power lies and without it we would 've not achieved what we have today . i wanted to disagree but sadly , the conversation got sucked into the spiral of socialism vs capitalism , and although it was very entertaining , we did n't have the chance to entertain the idea of non-hierarchal societies . so , here i am . & #x200b ; my reasoning : current societal structure dictate that a hierarchy must be implemented in order for them to practically work . i might be wrong , but when a hierarchy falls , chaos ensues until another hierarchy takes its place . think of revolutions . even though , these hierarchy were necessary for our survival , are they truly necessary now ? i admit temporary ( temporary as in you have a job where you have a superior . they are not your superior unless you 're indulging in that activity . ) micro-hierarchies are necessary for getting things efficiently done because of the bad qualities of human nature ( procrastination , laziness , greed , or whatever might keep someone from efficiently doing a task ) . think of work projects deadlines . however , why do macro-hierarchies have to exist ? it is easy to say that they are necessary because of the same reasons micro ones are , but micro-hierarchies are necessary for specialised fields to get things done . however , with societies , i believe it is different . here is how things could go : 1 . i will assume that every rational person would have the society 's betterment in his interest since the betterment of society benefits the individual . so in return no rational person would do something that would harm his society as it will return on him with harm . 2 . a macro non-hierarchal societal structure is one that entails that all men are equal in how they can affect and change society . though it allows for temporary micro-hierarchal structures so that contribution to society ( work ) is more efficiently completed . 3 . this sounds a lot like direct democracy , so i 'm going to assume a system that works like direct democracy . 4 . True direct democracy in greece worked for a while . however , our population size would definitely not allow for such a system . maybe a new one using current technology could be implemented where members of a society can vote for or against a proposal and if it is voted for , it is passed to a specialised micro-hierarchy to be executed . 5 . of course , in order to avoid corruption , everything would have to be transparent . meaning anyone can view where the funding went and how it was used . blockchain pretty much solves this . 6 . if we assume a greedy person whose interest lies against society 's betterment , would n't that structure disallow the greedy act from being committed , since it would harm everyone ? after all , no rational man would want to harm himself . so , in return , every act is an act done towards the betterment of society . i tried to give a rough example of how a non-hierarchal society would work . i believe that a hierarchy is the element that allows for injustice and corruption in societies , therefore , i feel like we should change how things work . we are all living within structures that we try to trick ourselves into feeling comfortable with just because we do not feel like we can change it or are too afraid to . i do n't feel that the inability or fear to act for some is justifiable in a just society .","to make a full counter-argument ; if we are examining systems only in an idealized way then why would it be preferable for everyone to have equal control of society ? would n't there exist some objective ' qualification ' by which we could allocate specific duties or responsibilities to people resulting in some people having more control over society at large then others ? this type of reasoning is easy to exploit in reality , but if we are limiting ourselves only to the ideal then it may not be an issue . and what i mean by that is , have you considered that your decision to view events through a lens that allows you to see a hierarchy of power is not an accurate view , but rather a reflection of your own ideology which allows you to maintain your own status quo ? that it is an abstraction from atomic facts in the same way the values of socialism are and that your efforts to deconstruct a "" system "" has actually only led to you constructing a rival system in which you have more "" power "" ? "" a macro non-hierarchal societal structure is one that entails that all men are equal in how they can affect and change society . though it allows for temporary micro-hierarchal structures so that contribution to society ( work ) is more efficiently completed . "" all men are equal , it is just these men have established multiple "" temporary micro-hierarchal structures so that contribution to society ( work ) is more efficiently completed "" . would you accept the premise that regardless of what objective standard you pick , some people will be objectively and subjectively better than other people at it ? furthermore , it appears you are inappropriately equating "" hierarchy "" with "" inequality "" , when they are not the same thing . the type of talent at harvard that made bill gates who had finished all his local college math classes in hs feel like he could never match up and convinced him to quit his math major is going to become richer much more likely than your small town pothead . there are ways to defend yourself or your family at the expense of society , for example running a factory that emits pollution . two is n't valid because some people are more able to effect change than others . a system with good leaders at the top performance much better than a system with no leaders . this is a standard assumption because it makes utopias easily , but the strength of a governing system is n't just how it handles great times , but how it handles the bad ."
9uorke,"smear campaigns need to end . smear campaigns aka , ads or campaigns solely against a political opponent , need to end , or have restrictions put on them . for every 10 political ads i saw this election season , 9 were "" do n't vote for x "" with not even a footnote for who it actually endorses . as i see it so that this does is encourage people to not vote since the primary message is just that . it also feeds on the outage mentality , which while i understand is a powerful tool , is less powerful than a rallying idea . i think that if any institution , at all , wants to buy political ad space , they should be required to endorse a candidate , and provide at minimum a sound byte describing that candidates position . this would promote more positive messages , and it would mean that you 're average voter would actually know something about the candidates they were intended to vote in . call me jaded but the current political climate is toxic and promotes toxicity . there is very little positive discourse any time politics is brought up , and this problem only feeds it .","if all we heard were positive things about both candidates , i could imagine a large segment of the population would just shrug and think "" well , either seems fine to me , so why bother voting ?

9uok5z,"one should n't vote for unopposed candidates in recent elections , i 've always seen people i know returning from the polls , proud that they 've cast their ballot for a handful of candidates -- among them , two or three who run in a district so heavily blue or red that no challenger is willing to make a stand . nevertheless , people seem to feel as much of a social obligation to vote for unchallenged candidates as they do for candidates in close races , and this does n't sit well with me . i have two arguments that i fall back on when discussing this with people . first , it 's that a candidate running unopposed has no chance of losing , and an inflated ( or even normal ) vote count on his/her part does n't correlate to how accountable they are to the electorate . if i ran unopposed , i could never send out volunteers to canvas , never set up a website , and never develop any policy positions , knowing that my victory was assured and i was free to do whatever once in office . that 's the logical extreme -- i realize it rarely ever goes there , but i find it troubling in principle to create a situation where this could happen . at the end of the day , the problem is giving a candidate too much of a mandate . second , i do n't believe in the efficacy of write in candidates . rarely , if ever , do they win office , even in small districts where small vote counts are needed . if a write in candidate in today 's midterms got as many votes as harambe did two years ago , then sure , but it wo n't happen . since write in candidates do n't pose a statistical threat , there 's no hidden reason to support the party 's nominee running unopposed . if an unopposed candidate were running against a write in candidate who actually stood a chance , then i 'd consider that an election where there was a challenger , and happily vote for whoever i supported . third , it 's fine to support the unopposed candidate , provided you actually know their policies and voting history , and actually want them to win . the problem arises when you use their party name on the ballot as a heuristic , or simply vote for the incumbent because , "" why not ? "" note : i 'll be at work today , and i 'll try to get back to comments asap . if i only get to yours after a few hours , i apologize .","on my ballot , the only unopposed seat is county clerk . i see no problem with voting for an unopposed administrator , because i do n't really need to know her policies , and she has no "" voting history "" as a legislator would have . i would suggest that your view should make an exception for non-policy-making positions . that is a pretty universal ' you are doing a good job ' type of mandate . whether you cast a vote or not for this person really matters not . people could not vote in this race for lots of reasons including the fact that it just does not matter if they vote . unopposed means 1 vote wins and the candidate will vote for themselves . you seem to be more upset that there is only one candidate not that there is any reasons to vote for them . you are correct about having a challenger which requires doing things to campaign for votes . so i always vote for the current judge and it does n't matter that i do n't know their views because i should n't be able to vote for them anyway the vote represents the individuals most powerful way in which he can enforce his right ( and obligation , if you ask me ) of governance over a representative democratic nation . as such , the individual should either create a political party following his or her own political views , or vote for a candidate or party that represents them most closely . now , in reality what happens is that people , i think , has a too pragmatic view of the vote ( in this sense at least , definitely not in others ) . you know , they see it as , why im going to vote for this guy , if he has no opposition hes gon na win anyway . as such , an unnoposed candidate has a vote count that absolutely correlates to his accountability , and a legitimacy equal to any other candidate . moreover if , as you say , this candidature has no opposition , its probably because the vast majority of voters are going to vote for him and no alternative candidature has any chance of winning , so a political campaing , website etc are simply not needed . as it is , his proposals seem to be good enough for the voters , or otherwise simply another candidate should present and , if any better , win . finally , many people have died for you to have voting rights . it has a very developed and studied philosophical ground , and most of us agree that the nation should be for the people , an run by the people ( it is unfortunately usually not , but thats another topic ) . although arguable , so far the only practical way for this has been the vote . surely you agree that you should still go vote , since its essentially impossible that everyone you 're voting for that day runs unopposed right ? so as long as you 're voting for all the elections that do matter , whats the harm in also voting for the unopposed candidate ?"
9uod5w,"the us house of representatives should guarantee approximately equal representation to all voters , and should be expanded as needed to accommodate population growth the current size of the house of representatives was set in 1911 and frozen in 1929 ; prior to that time , the house had been expanded with each new census . with a fixed number of seats and a mandate that all states be given at least one representative , the largest states ( ex . texas , california ) have had the political power of their citizens unfairly minimized , while the citizens of the smallest states ( ex . wyoming , vermont , north dakota ) have seen the relative value of their vote steadily increase . one current proposal to fix this is referred to as the wyoming rule , which would use the population of the smallest state as the denominator in a calculation to determine house size by equal proportion to overall population .","what i think would be a better solution , even though it has its own problems in implementation , would be to instead of adressing representation by number of representatives , to rather go to a system where representative a 's vote would count twice as much as representative b 's vote , if a represents twice as many people as b. sure , counting the votes would be more work , since it would have to be on an individual basis rather then a count of hands , but nothing that cant be done . the tradeoff would be that instead of two representatives for the same state voting differently you will aleays have the one representative ( or two or three , doenst have to be exactly one per state ) giving one vote , which disenfranchises vote-block minorities , but in practice right nwo that happens anyway . a major benefit is that you dont have to constantly change the number of representatives , possibly lagging behind the actual population counts , instead they would always immediately accurately represent the number of people they stand for . the electoral college , senate , and house are set up to specifically prevent a tyranny of the majority . remember the united states is a collection of states , not just a single entity , the separation of senate and house ensures state representation , while preserving the voice of the people . the wyoming rule is very restrictive , and fails to achieve the goals of a populist , and representative government . by keeping the house at a count in the high hundreds , we leave our government open to much of the same corruption we already face , we fail to represent the diversity within large rural states , and the specific needs of areas go undiscussed . instead we should be looking toward a much much larger house ( while keeping a politically small senate ) . when the house of representatives was conceived there was to be one representative per 30,000 to one per 35,000 . this tight of a number allows you not just to have a representative , but to know your representative personally ; sure , they may not like you personally , but accountability will reach to the micro level . with a house of representatives of over 7,000 people individual lobbying by corporations , or outright bribery gets more expensive . furthermore it greatly increases the chances of the house having True experts in a particular field , reducing the reliance on expert lobbyists to author bills . representatives could spend almost all of their time in their district and cooperate over common corporate productivity tools ( secured for government use ) . in addition many of the advantages of stability provided by the senate would still be in place , so while it carries some very big downsides as a sole legislative body , it carries some huge upsides as well , and the senate helps mitigate those concerns ."
9unx4w,"pressuring others to vote is both self-serving , and immoral . as election day ( in the us ) approaches , we are constantly inundated with text messages , calls , notifications ( even from reddit ) , and social media posts from celebrities urging us to vote , not caring in the least about whether i even have the slightest idea about what i am voting for . i find this to be extremely self-serving , and highly immoral & #x200b ; the general assumption from these people or organizations pushing people to vote , is that they are educated in what they are even voting for . without a strong political interest , nobody would care enough to pressure others into voting to begin with . there is a huge portion of the population who simply is n't knowledgeable in what they 'd be voting for , or does n't care enough to vote ( i.e. trusts the election in the hands of the people who know more about these things than they do ) . this is their right , and their choice to not vote . additionally , is n't there nothing more dangerous than an uneducated vote ? why would these people pressuring others want votes cast in an election ( that count exactly as much as an educated vote ) , where the person voting has very little clue of what they are even voting for ? for this reason , it comes off as self-serving . the people pushing others to vote , are mainly doing so because they assume their intended audience is of the same general mindset as they are , thus will vote in the way they want them to ( ex . reddit to its largely liberal user base , donald trump to his entirely republican rally attendees , etc ) . & #x200b ; despite what many celebrities and organizations may try to convince you of , voting is a right - not a duty . these are two extremely different things . it is my right to have children , but certainly not my duty . the same principle holds True for voting - it would certainly be considered immoral to pressure someone into having children , so why is it any different for voting ? & #x200b ; the goal of an election should be for everyone who \ wants \ to vote , to be able to vote . shaming others into feeling like they are not fulfilling some sort of civic duty by not voting seems to be in extremely poor taste to me , and is just another political ploy for people to swing the election in their favor . cmv . & #x200b ;","of course , it 's up to you to decide whether you think it 's a good idea , in the same way that it 's up to you to decide whether a new mattress or a spa weekend is a good idea . i 'd even argue that a get out and vote campaign serves more worth than an advert for a new mattress or a spa trip , because it 's encouraging people to be engaged in an issue that will actually impact them in some way in the near future . while i agree absolutely that a vote should be informed , nowhere in these get out and vote campaigns does it say that you should n't read up on the issues that matter to you , or even the ones that may not . in fact , it 's a pretty clever ploy - you advertise something as easy ( which the actual act of voting is , just tick a box ) and once you 've peaked someone 's interest , you let them decide for themselves that they need to do research once they 've realised they ca n't make a decision uninformed . it 's a big problem in the uk at the moment , university students with strong opinions and no effort to get out of bed and vote . in this case , the insistence on voting is absolutely correct , as young people make up a large portion of the voting age population and without their input the results of an election may not be an accurate representation of society as a whole , including them . many people will base their entire vote on a single issue that they believe is the most important when , politically speaking , there are more important things to worry about . lately it 's been immigration , with parties gaining and losing success based entirely on their stance on immigrants and refugees . i 'm not telling you to vote , and if you still do n't want to or feel it 's better for you not to then that 's absolutely your decision to make . keep in mind that my opinion is that if you dont keep yourself informed on at least a little bit of politics and dont vote you dont deserve the benefits that are the products of the laws created by the law makers but do deserve the consequences of any laws . i personally do n’t care whether or not someone is well informed , but i ’d encourage them to vote either way . i ’d rather avod that and convince people that they do have a voice , and encourage them to vote . the only bad decision a voter can make is to not make their preference known , because they will still have to deal with the results of the election either way . you assuming that people only encourage likeminded individuals to vote is just an assumption and does n’t apply to people like me , who will encourage everyone to vote , regardless of who their preferred candidate is . if you live in a democracy , you have a responsibility to research the issues and candidates , and vote . gotv ( get out the vote ) campaigns generally target people who have expressed opinions on an issue but may not actually go to the polls to express that opinion . consider a situation with two parties : the "" kill puppies and kittens "" party and the "" do n't kill puppies and kittens "" party . if i go up to someone and encourage them to vote , and they tell me "" meh , i do n't know enough about them so why bother "" that is 100 % on them , but it affects me because i like puppies and kittens ."
9unml8,"the american voting system is flawed for many reasons as a german i obviously only have an outsider view and probably only hear about it when it goes wrong , but there are a few things that for me are just illogical or seem obviously ill advised and exploitable and maybe even relatively easily fixable . ## first past the post cpg grey made an informative and easy to understand video series about it and it 's alternatives , which i would highly recommend you watch . the fptp system not only heavily favours a two party system leading to the current situation where a third party vote is generally considered a wasted vote , but also leads to big discrepancies in voters and their representations . i see the appeal of voting directly for a single candidate that is supposed to represent you , as the us seems to love to do on every level of government , but just grouping the districts into groups of 3 and using a slightly different voting system like stv or alternative vote would result in a much more representative distribution of the seats . ## voter registration why do you even need to register every time you want to vote ? why not register everyone who is eligible to vote automatically and then just let them decide for themselves if they want to act on their right to vote . i recently did a eli5 question on why voter registration even is a thing , and the reasons while understandable for the current system just seem to be a big hurdle for everyone involved . and i know that the problem that would arise with this is the voter id problem , because it 's hard/difficult/expensive to get an id . but why ?? should n't everyone have an id anyways ? again , maybe that 's just the german in me thinking , but in germany you are required by law to have an id as soon as you 're 16 years old . you can get your id at every city hall for a small fee of 10-50 € . and you need to register to vote to tell whoever is organizing it where you feel at home and where you want to vote . and since in local elections a street over can mean you 're voting on a different person , this is very important . and again : but why ? is n't there a central registry somewhere in which the state or even country knows where you live ? in germany you need to have a "" primary place of residence "" . it 's the one in your passport/id and it is which determines where you 're getting to vote . and it 's used for every single election , be it local , state ( yes , we do have "" states "" in germany as well ) or country . on whatever level there is an election , everyone that lives in the affected area will get an invitation to vote and is automatically registered . ## electoral college okay , this one is weird . there are lots of people i read online that are defending the ec for giving rural areas a voice and whatnot , and historically it made sense in the 18-hundreds , but the fact of the matter is , that it produced","a lot of us citizens would see this as breaching their freedom to not have an id . what you have to take in account is that the system is skewed in one direction , and that this party does n't want to fix it . as an american , i agree that we have a ton of problems with our electoral system . while we 've certainly changed it over time , the government of today can trace an unbroken line back to 1789 . we have an incredible track record of peaceful transfer of power . other than the uk , no european nation can claim a similar longevity . hell , germany did n't even exist as a country when our electoral system started . despite our many , many , many flaws , the longevity of the system has to give it some credit . many-party systems might feel more ideologically flexible by allowing for the quick rise and fall of small parties , but at the same time , it risks alienating the voters from the responsibility of forming an actual majority consensus . in germany , you get to vote for linke , or afd , or the greens , but you do n't have much control over who gets to actually govern , and to pass legislation . that 's up to the coalition negotiations , that can fall in any direction . this can lead to situations like 2017 's perception that "" all roads lead to merkel "" . you go in , cross the x for your favorite ideologically pure minority , and then regardless of what the exact result will be , the canniest , most experienced politician will just make the necessary backroom deals to stay in power , even if the result is not what anyone has wanted . in contrast , in the us the perception that you always have to vote for "" the lesser of two evils "" might be personally frustrating , but it leads means that if for example a leftist-aligned environmentalist , the democratic party can only win if they bring you within the big tent . yes , there is a pressure for voters to make compromises as a voter , but also for the parties to make comromises to reach a majority . it 's like a perpetual coalition negotiation , that is for once up to the voters : if you are a us environmentalist , you constantly have to cajole , threaten , and manipulate the democrats to pander more to you . first off , you do n't have to register every time you want to vote . as long as you vote every now and then , you are considered an active voter . changing voter registration is very simple and can be completed online in most states . second , no one in the us spends one second worried about how germans vote ."
9unm7v,"animal testing is perfectly fine in the pursuit of medicinal science so , i recently participated in a 24-hour charity stream in aid of stand up to cancer , a fundraising campaign by the british channel 4 in aid of cancer research uk . in attempting to drum up donations , a few people refused , claiming they did n't want to support the charity , as it does test some of its prospective drugs on animals . now , in my mind , this did n't throw up a moral quandary to me . i 'm not ashamed to admit that , in general , i put the welfare of humans above the welfare of animals , and if there is True potential in a type of treatment or medication to truly cause medical breakthroughs or help for research for horrible things like cancer et al , that the death and potential suffering of animals to that goal is a price that 's worth paying . obviously i think every attempt to be made to limit this suffering but , like i said , i do n't see that suffering as important as the suffering of humans that live with horrible diseases potentially being abated . do n't get me wrong , i do n't hate animals or anything . i hate using animals for testing more vacuous things like cosmetics , and i can even see the point that vegans make about how we do n't necessarily need meat or dairy to have a balanced diet and that we should n't use animals for either of those things . i also hate just general animal abuse from pet owners . but ultimately , when you 're choosing between the life of a human or the life of an animal , i 'm almost always going to opt to save the life of a human , or sacrifice the life of an animal to save them . to give a very extreme hypothetical , if there were an endangered species of animal that we somehow discover has the potential to cure a deadly disease , but we have to harvest their brain or heart or something to get it , i 'd be perfectly fine with doing that . people tell me this is a bit heartless , and i know people really like animals , and i 'm all for protecting their welfare as best we can , but if there is a legitimate chance that some deadly diseases can be cured at the cost of some animal lives , i think that 's a completely worth trade off . so , cmv . or at least make me understand why this viewpoint sometimes get massive pushback from some despite the fact that i feel most people would value the life of a human over the life of an animal .","so if we are not willing to perform tests on those types of humans , why would we be willing to perform those same tests on an animal ? but the moral burden of necessity for those tests would change - you 'd have to prove that the tests are vital to saving the lives of many if you happen to believe that human lives are no more sacred than any other animals life , then the natural conclusion would be that it 's wrong . you would n't consider rounding up people 's in ireland to perform experiments in because they 're good analogues for the scottish to treat a disease currently detected in scotland . if you 're at one extreme of animal rights , that 's what you believe and i think there are good justification for that ethical position ( just as you might have good justifications for yours ) . i myself agree that animal testing is tolerable , but should be avoided if we have a good alternative ( which some parts here suggest there might be ) . nonetheless i am sympathetic to the animal rights camp , even the extremists . i 'm just pointing out why people might disagree that it 's "" perfectly fine "" and that there should be some reluctance in the process . i 'm happy to discuss further about the ethical underpinnings of animal rights if that is the core of your question . more than 90 % of the drugs that clear animal trails fail human trials . i was under the impression it ’s just really not that helpful in determining the effect on/safety for humans ."
9umu2d,both drug addiction and mental illness are natural reactions to the mental contortions needed for dealing with the modern world we live in a world of contradictions . we know that other people provide our lives with meaning but our society worships individualism . as a consequence we are routinely encouraged to prioritise our momentary whims and discount other 's long term suffering . we 're told that all humans are equal but it only takes a rudimentary glance at the world to see this is emphatically not the case and never has been . having to deal with these mental contortions without necessarily being able to articulate or ' deal ' with them leads to escapism .,"you are also making a big deal about nothing , the contradictions you listed are fairly simple concepts . you are an individual but you can connect with other people . equality is a positive ideal to aspire to like honesty or goodness , people had values in imperfect world for as long as we 've existed . there 's more than "" escapism "" to drug addiction , and obviously for mental illness . like cars exist because they are a natural reaction to the modern world . the existence of this cup i 'm holding is a reaction to the modern world . if so , at least one of those things are likely wrong because mental illness has a strong genetic basis , and escapism is not exclusive to the modern world , nor even to humans . imagine a world where the largest income gap was between a pharaoh who is literally worshipped as a god and a slave who is literally subhuman , and where the idea of "" middle class "" has not even been invented yet . there is no indication that rates of mental illness has increased in modernity , nor drug use . for example , wikipedia says that "" the earliest recorded uses [ of cannabis as a drug ] date from the 3rd millennium bc "" and that "" ancient civilizations described and treated a number of mental disorders . mental illnesses were well known in ancient mesopotamia , where diseases and mental disorders were believed to be caused by specific deities . "" the only reason we have more drug use is because drugs are more easily available and the only reason we appear to have more mental illness is because we now diagnose them as such rather than as evil spirits or just strange behavior . i am not 100 % clear on what you want me to debate on , so i will express my opposition of saying that both of the issues are natural reactions . i know it is hard to stop doing drugs or stop smoking once there is an addiction , but the person who has a drug addiction had a choice to start it . that is a choice they have made , compared to mental illnesses , which is not a choice . you may argue that taking drugs or smoking or drinking might be an outlet for relieving stress , but there are many many alternatives that might not work the same way , but can probably replace use of drugs , alcohol or smoking . i 'm pointing out that a person can choose to use or not use the substance . if they never touch alcohol/drugs/smoking , then even if they have genetic history of addiction they wo n't get addicted to things , because they 've never done it in the first place . i 'll get to that shortly , but i disagree that mental illness is a reaction to the world and will address that first . whilst it 's True that external stimuli can aggravate or initiate some mental illnesses , the conditions are tightly coupled to the makeup of the brain which is influenced strongly by genes . it all can get a bit nature vs nurture from here but i think the presence of a strong genetic link is sufficient to it from this discussion . now regarding drug addiction , there are very many people who use drugs as a form of escapism , especially alcohol . however i think in this regard it extends further in both axes . not only are drugs used , but so very many things are avenues of escapism for people . the reasons to escape are n't sufficiently described by the cognitive dissonances people have to endure but also the reality of their lives and the responsibilities they have , jobs , children , family , social obligations and so on and so forth . in light of those things , particularly for parents , i think the philosophical dissonances you speak of are a relatively minor part of what make people want to escape their lives for a time ."
9umb68,"china 's behavior in the south china sea is imperialism china has in recent years started expanding its military presence in the south china sea and militarizing reefs and outposts with regularity . its claims compete with those of vietnam , the philippines , japan , taiwan , and malaysia and this is for good reason . china is seeking to establish itself as a regional hegemony that controls billions in economic thoroughfare in the region . in addition to this china is aiming to establish itself as the sole beneficiary to the energy and fishery rights within those same outcroppings . their military has shown their willingness to seek conflict with the united states navy repeatedly in this pursuit . china has shown its willing to selectively enforce laws of the sea to maximize their benefit , even ignoring the permanent court of arbitration when they found in favor of the phillipines . china is expanding its presence into greater asia and aiming to control trade flow for the above countries by controling avenues for shipping . this represents a potential 600 million usd loss for japan and 250 million for south korea . & #x200b ; they are seeking to extend their territorial reach , assert control over the region , and lock out the us and allies from having recourse in the region . this is n’t like other regional disputes like the dokdo island in japan ’s sea , but a concentrated effort by a country to inch itself into regional dominance and military control over foreign ports .","but i think you can argue that it 's a completely conventional way that a large , powerful nation would attempt to gain more power . and arguably it 's power that would be in the hands of china if it were n't for another imperialistic power , the us . so , the us is there for power related reasons , which is imperialism , same with the middle east , same with south america , etc. . i think all powerful nations tend to end up exerting their influence over other countries ; and china is getting more powerful , and have conflicting interests with the us . honestly i think it 's more of a war of influence between the us and china rather than imperialism ( but i guess thats imperialism ) , the only thing that matters is that "" might makes right "" and for now the us is the mightiest . either china was the overly aggressive nation that tried to have too much , or that the us was being too stubborn and would n't let the world change in an attempt to maintain the status quo wherein they have the majority of the power . either way i did n't really try to change your view because think what you like , but i think it 's important to see both sides ' view of the issue . i do n't think imperialism is the right word to use , as china is technically ruled by the communist party , even if they 've thrown most communist economic policy out the window . what they are doing can be more accurately described as establishing a buffer state to protect their homeland . the main difference between how the soviet union set up eastern europe as their buffer states and what china is doing is based on the main military threat to china being the us navy instead of any land force . china demonstrated in the korean war that they are more than capable of grinding any army on earth to a halt in a land based war . if their mainland was n't protected by massive ranges of deserts or mountains they might be trying to meddle in the sovereignty of neighboring countries as well . if a large scale conflict happened between china and america then it would likely play out similarly to the war between america and japan , being hinged upon naval warfare and strategic air bombing with land war taking place to secure air bases on islands . because of this china is taking steps to protect itself by creating bases to project sea and air power outside of its main land so that it would n't be in danger of blockade . as far as economic reasons go , there is a little bit of money to be made in securing ocean resources , but this will be a drop in the bucket conpared to their domestic economy and foreign investment elsewhere in the world . because of the relatively small economic gain they would get with such risky expansion , i think that this is mainly a military decision which again makes it far closer to establishing border states than imperialism ."
9um63o,"it 's not racist to say "" it 's okay to be white "" this is by far one of the most perplexing news stories i think i 've ever seen . it seems unquestionable that saying "" it 's ok to be \ [ any race \ ] "" should be one of the most benign statements anyone could make . if i said of myself "" it 's ok to be asian "" and people got upset over it , the people who got upset would rightfully be discarded as racists . and yet : [ -- url -- ) [ -- url -- ) [ -- url -- ) there 's no shortage at all of people saying these flyers are white supremacist . i get it though , the flyers , according to knowyourmeme , were intended as a red herring by racists on 4chan in order to prove that the media had a bias against white people . however , nothing about the statement itself is racist , and yet the media calls the statement racist without any mention of 4chan 's ruse . it 's not likely they know about their plan , in any case , because if they did they would n't have done exactly what 4chan was hoping they would do ; foaming at the mouth at such an inconsequential statement of fact and showing everyone that they regard any claim that being white is something other than a crime is sacrilegious . in summary : "" it 's okay to be asian "" is not racist . "" it 's okay to be black "" is not racist . "" it 's okay to be hispanic "" is not racist . "" it 's okay to be aborigine "" is not racist . "" it 's okay to be white "" is not racist .","the way language works is that it 's possible to insult someone merely with context , while the formal structure says the exact opposite . however the context clearly implies that the norm is that black people have low iq . sure , white racists pretend that sjws say this all the time , but as someone who 's all in with social justice , i 've never actually heard anyone on the left say that being white is wrong . as a white person , i 've never heard it , except said by white supremacist racists . if you immediately respond with "" it 's okay to be white all lives matter "" , you essentially discard her entire experience . within that context , it 's extremely racist to immediately focus on your own race , which does n't have issues , without acknowledging her issues that stem from race . the statement "" all lives matter "" is now racist in and of itself , because it has always been used to shut down activists for racial equality . so even though the words sound neutral , they 're not . the original post that started it all was literally asking for an explicitly non-racist statement to prove that there are anti-white people that will object to it . the thing is you should n't judge this based solely on the statement "" it 's ok to be white "" because as you said it 's benign ... if a random person said it . if pauline hanson says it , if known advocates of white nationalism say it , then the implications and goals are very objectionable . the statement implies that it 's hard to be white , that white people are victims , that they should come together to fight for their interests in society the way other groups do . in short it 's a white supremacy slogan designed to recruit people into white supremacy political groups . and the reason you should be concerned about the phrase "" it 's ok to be white "" is because it appears so benign , that people who do n't know it 's made by white supremacists good enter into that political realm under False pretenses . there is an underlying subtext to the message which implies that any criticism of white majority power or institutional racism is wrong - that "" it 's okay to be white "" with everything that may or may not entail . it 's a dismissal tactic designed to brush opposing viewpoints under the rug , similar to the "" all lives matter "" response to "" black lives matter "" . you speak up and say "" i 'd really like a piece of cake "" , and instead of getting cake the response is "" well , we would all like a piece of cake "" . that does n't answer your question or solve your concern - it sarcastically dismisses your complaint by putting forth a meaningless assertion that sounds nice on the surface , but addresses nothing . that is the tactic employed by these dismissal phrases - they sound well meaning and uncontroversial , but are just a dog-whistle . thing is that in the current climate , this quote communicates more than just simply that being white is ok ; it 's meant as a "" reassurance "" to other white people . and to someone who believes that any criticism leveled at white people is the result of some kind of bias against white people , it will signal that it 's ok to ignore such criticism . would you assume that this is a legitimate argument or would you think that 's it 's just someone trying to discredit the disabled movement by using the "" so abled lives do not matter ? "" it was not okay to be black , asian , hispanic , aborigine ... etc . the statement itself is not racist if you remove all social historical context from it . but in context of the prejudice the other races had endured , it 's like saying "" its okay to earn a six figure salary "" amidst your employees who are making minimum wage . if you earn six figures , you should recognise that you are in a more enviable position than your employees and that they may have legitimate grievances that you do not have to experience . earning six figures is not the issue , saying "" it 's okay to earn six figures "" makes you a wage supremacist . saying "" it 's okay to be white "" presupposes that there is some significant group that believes otherwise , like there are significant groups that do n't think it 's okay to be asian , black , hispanic , aborigine , or any number of other ethnicities . the race-inferior but somehow still world-controlling communist jew who runs a bank , for whom the ' not racist ' dog whistle is that dumb ( ( ( parenthesis thing ) ) ) that supposedly implies the magical world conspiracy . the lazy immigrant who does all the hardest jobs for low pay who is also stupid but who manages to beat the state 's security at every turn , for whom "" the wall "" is the ' not racist ' dog whistle . tl ; dr - it 's a racist dog whistle because it presupposes an in reality nonexistent enemy for white people to wage war against . which is why ' when is white history month ' comes off as tone deaf and somewhat ignorant . by contrast , ' its okay to be white ' can often be seen as promoting white supremacy , particularly with the current resurgence . in certain context i 'm sure it is fine , but i 'm not remotely shocked that people seeing a message like that would jump to the assumption that it is in support of white nationalism . just as the words "" white pride "" or "" all lives matter "" do n't mean anything on their own , "" it 's ok to be white "" does n't mean anything on its own . the problem is that the groups that use those words or symbols are predominantly bigoted with ulterior motives ( honestly an understatement in some cases ... ) . unless there 's a concerted effort by non-bigots to "" reclaim "" those words ( e.g. explicitly saying "" i 'm proud to be white but not at the expense of respect for others "" ) they will continue to carry negative connotations for generations to come . it 's impossible to understand the significance or intent of any statement without placing it in the context in which it was made . which is why ' when is white history month ' comes off as tone deaf and somewhat ignorant . by contrast , ' its okay to be white ' can often be seen as promoting white supremacy , particularly with the current resurgence . in certain context i 'm sure it is fine , but i 'm not remotely shocked that people seeing a message like that would jump to the assumption that it is in support of white nationalism ."

( u.k. focus ) in my opinion remembrance day is a glorification of soldiers , largely in ww1 : "" those brace few "" "" the greatest sacrifice they made "" etc . which is problematic as war should not be romanticised as that can quickly lead to more war . the poppy movement , although well meant , is now more of a cult . buying and wearing a poppy is seen as mandatory . all public institutions observe the 2 min silence . political figures are chastised for not reacting in the way they are supposed to . this leads to a culture where questioning and disagreeing are not tolerated ( i am aware the white poppy movement is growing , but it is still controversial ) finally the entire event is a little hypocritical : the whole point is to remember the dead , and more importantly the chain of events that lead to their deaths . however i hear on the radio , posters & adverts , and social media people saying things like : "" they died so we can live in a free world "" . when ( afaik ) this is not why they died . austrian and german imperial ambitions were gearing up , along with uk french and dutch , largely in africa and the middle east . there was an arms race which we were leading . the whole thing was about power . there were no "" enemies "" every nation was as bad as each other . it was a pointless war which we ( the uk ) had a big part in starting , but rather than own up to that we tell everyone to "" never forget "" .","also , poppies were used to often shame soldiers protesting about horrible conditions in the army in the late ' 10s and early '20s as being somehow "" unpatriotic "" when really they just wanted enough rations to survive and maybe encourage conditions that would n't lead to most of them dying of dysentery . to pay my way through university i worked at the australian war memorial ... i imagine remembrance day is commemorated similarly there . think of any war poet and you ’d probably come up with either wilfred owen or siegfried sassoon ... to quote owen : commemorative events marking the centenary have world leaders coming together to honour and pay respect to the fallen in shared humanity ."
9ulerl,"the option to vote by mail in all local , state and national elections ( in the us ) should be available in all 50 states i ’m not arguing that vote by mail should replace traditional voting , but that in addition to in person voting , there should be the nationally recognized option to vote by mail as an in-state resident ( absentee ballots being another matter ) . numerous studies have shown that when the option to vote by mail is available , voter turnout increases — mainly in state and local elections ( links to the studies in comments ) . the option to vote by mail lends itself to convenience and accessibility for populations that are unable to participate in in-person voting ( ex . populations without reliable transportation to polling stations and people whose job or career prevents them from taking time off on a tuesday to vote ) . the main criticism i have seen repeated by those against vote by mail is that it degrades the sense of community and patriotism that comes from in-person voting but as someone who has both a prohibitive work and class schedule , i personally felt a greater sense of fulfilling my civic duty when given the option to vote by mail rather than the stress and anxiety that arose when i used to struggle to find the time and transportation necessary to vote in-person . us election assistance commission report on vote by mail national conference of state legislatures report washington post report on vote by mail","fortunately , washington state at least makes me sign the outside of the envelope when i mail my ballot in , and they compare it to my signature on file . this establishes that i at least know a ballot 's being sent in my name . there 's no way of establishing that with voting by mail . yes , voting by mail has a lot of advantages , as you say . what you do n't want is a situation where you can sell your vote . if somebody fills out a form and mails it to the voting officials it is possible they sold their vote . what the us needs to do if they want a higher voter turnout is a fundamental redesign of the election process so that people can actually make choices that matter . and any vote that is not for the biggest of those two sides gets thrown out the window . my main issue with voting by mail is not knowing that my vote was received and counted . i have visual confirmation that the vote was received and counted . since polling places are staffed by several people the likely hood that someone could tamper or destroy my vote is small , and if someone did , it would be evident at some point ."
9uj5il,"i should vote yes on missouri ’s amendment 1 for the 2018 midterm elections . amendment 1 is a ballot initiative that will change the missouri constitution to accomplish the 5 following things : 1 . eliminate all lobbyist gifts to state legislature over $ 5 2 . limit personal contributions to $ 2500 and $ 2000 for state senate and house rep respectively 3 . require state politicians to wait at least 2 years after serving their terms to become lobbyists 4 . require legislative records be open to the public 5 . dramatically change the redistricting process to eliminate gerrymandering detailed information on the amendment can be found here . ( the full amendment text is on the bottom of that link , and is a fairly quick read ) there are also many articles discussing the amendment a simple online search will bring up as well . the first four reasons are generally uncontroversial , and i support all of them . while i ’m open to arguments addressing those , ideally i ’d like to focus on the fifth point , because that seems to be the point of contention . the amendment replaces a bipartisan committee tasked with drawing legislative maps with a position appointed by the state auditor ( currently a democrat ) . this appointed “ non-partisan state demographer ” will then be in charge of drawing districts such that they ( in order of importance ) : have equal population and conform to the voting rights act promote partisan fairness ( minimize wasted votes , see this explanation ) promote competitiveness ( number of seats elected follows simulated changes in state voting preferences ) are contiguous and compact the two main arguments against this amendment that i ’ve seen are : 1 . it received significant funding from george soros 2 . the “ non-partisan ” demographer position is actually a partisan appointed position . my counter arguments to those points are : 1 . this amendment has received immense grassroots support , on top of large donations . even more importantly , however , is that regardless of who donates it can not be skewed to unfairly benefit someone : there is no possible quid-pro-quo resulting from the amendment ’s passage , as the rules apply to everyone . soros donating to it still limits campaign contributions the same if the koch brothers or the nra or planned parenthood were to donate . because of this , it is n’t important to me where the money came from . 2 . the rules for drawing new legislative maps are precise and stringent , such that drawing the map essentially becomes solving a math problem . the map must minimize wasted votes and accurately adjust to changes in voting preferences , while remaining as contiguous and compact as possible . achieving the above is defined as constitutional . therefore , if the map is biased or gerrymandered , it is unconstitutional by definition . because of this , any partisan bias the demographer has ( and i admit it is a partisan position ) is essentially moot - they are solving a math problem , and if they bias the maps , it is by definition unconstitutional and will be redrawn . i ’m planning to vote for this amendment because of its claim of “ cleaning up ” missouri politics , and i believe that the changes it makes to the state constitution will accomplish just that . my view can be changed by showing that this amendment actually leads to more bribery and corruption than the current system or a realistic alternative system , or by highlighting downsides and arguing that they are not worth the benefits provided .","that is 100 % what this amendment is about and all the rest is weak-sauce window dressing to get people to vote for it , including the stupid and misleading name . beware , because when the party in power shifts , so does the redistricting power . why would anyone want to take this away from an equally represented bi-partisan panel that needs a 70 % approval and hand it to one unelected human being that can only be overridden by a 70 % vote ?! so for the most part , i agree with you here , and in fact i do n't necessarily agree with the point i 'm about to make , but i know that many people do . however , a point that is brought up with removing gerrymandering is the practice of affirmative racial gerrymandering . that is , the creation of districts designed to be majority minority to ensure that racial minorities in those states have representatives that can represent them on a national level and was encouraged by the voting rights act of 1965 to protect african-american voters . in fact , fivethirtyeight did a series on redistricting and have a number of interactive graphics that point this out . now if we look at a redistricted map that is designed to create the greatest number of [ majority minority districts ] ( -- url -- #majmin ) , you might notice something really interesting . in fact , many republican states made sure to create majority minority districts in their redistricting process . they happen to be one of the few times when what might be favorable for minorities is not necessarily favorable for democrats , as minority voters ( who are often reliably democrats ) are packed together into a neat voting districts while nearby urban white democrats can be cracked into multiple republican districts . let 's say though , that you decide to go through with a redistricting plan in missouri that makes the greatest number of [ highly competitive districts ] ( -- url -- #competitive ) , which is what i will call the closest interpretation of your minimum wasted votes guideline . ( you could apply that to all the districts , but it would create an entirely republican held state as democrats make a significant minority in the state ) . it creates five highly competitive districts and three usually republican ones . but notice what it does to the majority minority districts . every single district becomes majority white , and there is a good chance that this would run afoul of the voting rights act of 1965 . in fact , i would bet that you would see a republican led lawsuit on that very subject ( see the umpteen national review articles on the subject ) . also consider that many people do n't enjoy the idea that their representation would be highly competitive as it might decrease political stability and increase the amount of money spent in these elections , meaning smaller grassroots candidates would find it increasingly harder to compete and would promote having candidates with some broad support rather than focusing very specifically on actionable goals for their constituency . i think the proposal is generally a good idea and i feel like it 's challenging to say you should n't vote for it because this is objectively better than no proposal at all , but i have a few issues with a couple of the regulations that i feel makes the proposal too busy , so to say . the issue i have is with the two lobbying regulations . in a state government where the terms are short and the politicians ( as they are in my state ) might be severely term limited , lobbying is an important industry that provides valuable information to politicians . many politicians do n't have time to learn everything there is to know about important issues because their platforms focus on other issues . there are generally lobbyists from multiple sides of these issues , so one firm that represents one tech company and another firm representing another tech company could come to a committee or to a meeting and educate the politician about the issue at hand . without the lobbyists , the politician is likely to simply vote along partisan lines without thinking . politicians can still get gifted and educated by lobbyists and still be for the people . unfortunately a lot of them do serve special interests , but we have the ability to vote them out , especially if more people can easily see who is effecting their policy choices . lobbying is important because none of them can learn the ropes fast enough to be effective without diverse lobbying . missouri constitutional amendments proposed by initiative are required to consider only one topic . this amendment narrowly passed this measure through the argument that redistricting deals with the legislature , open records deal with the legislature , and campaign finance deal with the legislature ( therefore the one topic was "" the legislature "" ) . i disagree with this finding , and find that the lumping together of these 5 topics is intentionally done to create voter confusion in an effort to push through the more controversial redistricting change by logrolling it with 4 strongly supported ethics and transparency reforms . this violates the intent of the prohibition on multiple topics in a constitutional amendment initiative , and i support voting no to force the supporters of this initiative to return in a different year and resubmit with the redistricting change , at minimum , as a separate vote ."

9uijks,"making bathroom access contingent on the gender on your birth certificate actually makes it easier for non-trans men to use women 's bathrooms . so , let us propose that a bathroom bill has passed . to the delight of people who think all trans women are rapists , everybody must now use the bathroom corresponding to the gender they were assigned at birth . intersex people are still a thorn in the side of the lawmakers , but let 's forget about them for now . an example of a room full of trans men & #x200b ; now , these dudes are all highly hunky , and i 'm not going to pretend all or even most trans men look like them . but they 're all cis-passing ( you probably would n't know they were trans if you saw one on the street ) . now , under our new law , these handsome hunks now need to use the women 's room . some of them may have a had a phalloplasty to give them a penis , or may be wearing packers ( something that gives the impression of having a penis ) . but this is all irrelevant . they have to use the women 's room , and if challenged , can say ' sorry , it 's the law . i do n't like it any more than you do ' . there is nothing to stop cis ( non-trans ) men from going into a women 's bathroom , without doing any preparation at all , and doing the exact same thing . bathroom bills make bathrooms less safe by my view , not more safe . one last point : in my circles , i know a few trans people living in areas where bathroom bills are in effect . they do n't even follow them . for both trans men and trans women ( sorry , non-binary people ) , even something small like using the wrong bathroom can cause dysphoria , and , particularly for trans women , can be unsafe . there 's literally no way to police them . a cisgender lesbian was recently thrown out of a bowling alley because she tried to use the women 's bathroom - she was n't trans , she just had short hair and was n't wearing a dress . in conclusion , i believe that bathroom bills make bathrooms themselves less safe for both trans and cis people , and are impossible to police .","of course bathroom bills are n't really about trans ppl at all , they 're about political point-scoring by punching down on trans ppl . should your cmv really be : "" cmv : changing the law to make bathroom access contingent on your sex at birth makes it easier for bigots to get elected "" . i see your point , but you also see that it would never work that way : “ sir ! i dont think i understand , how would it make it easier for a non trans man to use a womans bathroom . im not sure if i misunderstood something but it just dosent make any sense to me in the terms laid out , like are you saying theres nothing to stop them from doing it now and that will somehow make it easier ? bathrooms should be gender-neutral to begin with because creeps come in any gender or sex and if you want to address that , segregating them by any particular group is n't going to change a damn thing . unfortunately , since the opposition to trans bathroom use was never really based on sound reasoning to begin with , they 're likely just going to change their demands to something like : only women born as women can use the women 's bathroom . everyone else ( trans women , trans men and cis men ) would probably be expected to always use the men 's room . i highly doubt police are going to be outside bathrooms verifying birth certificates before allowing entry . that means the more likely outcome is that trans persons continue to use the restroom that best fits their look , and anyone who "" looks "" like the other sex and enters the "" wrong "" bathroom will have the police called on them . that includes both trans and cis men who use the women 's bathroom . it does n't make it any easier for cis men to infiltrate the women 's restroom because they 'll still have the police called on them if they look like a man . it 'll probably make it inconvenient for trans men who try to follow the letter of the law , but that does n't make it unsafe . ah but what if the bill requires all bathroom to install a slot where you insert your birth certificate to gain entry ? case1 ) must use birth gender - > cis man lies and says he was born a woman case2 ) use gender you identify with - > cis man lies and says he feels more like a woman case 1 is easy to prove to be a lie in court . case 2 is impossible to prove to be a lie in court . therefore , making bathroom access contingent on the gender on your birth certificate does not make it easier for non-trans men to use women 's bathrooms . disclaimer : i want people to be able to use the bathroom of the gender they identify with . this post was stated in regards to "" ease "" of use though . well your entire post seems conditioned upon the idea that sex-segregation of bathrooms mostly exists to give females a female-only space and that seems to be the mindset of the people who back the bathroom bill as well . i think they would just go with : "" female bathroom is for cis females ; everyone else into the male bathroom "" in practice . but yeah i 've certainly noticed that wheneever people talk about transgender people what they seem to almost only be talking about are white mtfs and completely forget that anything else exists ; all these discussions always seem to bring mtfs forward and forget that ftms are nearly that common . the social norms about bathrooms is “ if you look like a guy go to the guys toilet . if you look like a girl go to the girls toilet ”"

9uht5a,"the increase in gender and sexuality vocabulary is not needed and ultimately hurts social progress on the topic i first want to say that i am a very open person and wouldnt consider my self - phobic in any sense . my brother is trans and have never had any problems with him . my concern is specifically with vocabulary . i believe in order to actively achieve higher social acceptance , the increase in gender and sexuality terms should be stunted . hear me out : i think the terms covered in lgbt is all that is needed to spearhead cultural reform . most words that are gaining attention in gender study thought are unneeded . ( i am not arguing that these words are new , i am aware of their decades long existence , i 'm just talking recent social increase . ) for example , pansexual . that is really just bisexual in my opinion . when describing yourself one can simply say "" i 'm bi but personality is very important to me "" . or terms like metrosexual , "" nah i 'm straight but just a bit flamboyant . the shortening of terms would also alleviate in group confusion around words . gender queer for example . one can say "" i 'm straight but a bit flamboyent "" , or "" i would consider sex with a man "" ( bisexual ) . the increase in terms generally hurts social progress because the proponents of the word end up being made a joke out of in the mainstream . their points are generally lost in translation . instead of fighting for metrosexual , or nonbinary rights , we should fight for the acceptance of straight men being able to act feminine and vice versa . that would be taken much better in my opinion . i think for every gender vocab word we now have , we can describe with words that already existed easily . and doing so would progress social acceptance further .",""" metrosexual "" here serves as a good anti-pattern since it was invented as a joke by a newspaper , the independent to describe the grooming habits of young and professional straight men who were appropriating some elements of gay men 's fashion . feminine gay men similarly have their own fashion which is still typically recognizable as a form of men 's fashion , albeit one that 's a marker for social prejudice and marginalization by some forms of straight culture . while those boundaries are somewhat flexible , both metrosexual and feminine gay men would generally agree that they 're men without much question . rather than challenge the language we use to describe gender dysphoria and nonconformity , why not challenge the idea that gender dysphoria and nonconformity are inherently funny ? the goal of equality is to be accepted despite our dissimilarities with the mainstream . similarly here : we should n't have to simplify our vocabulary to make it easier for other people to accept us , whether it 's because they do n't like change , or because they believe that we 're trying to be special snowflakes . so do you also believe that there should be a reduction in terms from the old standard and that terms like "" bisexual "" just should n't exist ?"

9ugcow,"the single most effective change we could make to the american political system is adopting ranked voting into our electoral system it ’s that time in american politics when it ’s time to vote for our local elections ! what an incredibly important and impactful way to spend your afternoon , right ? a way to voice your values and impact legislation … right ? well , actually , there are a lot of mathematical and pragmatic criticism of our current voting system . it ’s so complex , and most of the argument barrels down to the ideology our democracy is should aim to allow each citizen to have an influence , but pragmatically it ’s damn near impossible to represent a person ’s voice . i ’ll be supporting the claim that i believe a ranked voting , or ranked-choice voting , is the single best change we could make to our political structure in america . ranked voting applies to any non-binary vote ( usually candidates , not referendums or initiates ) , and is simply the act of allowing a voter to vote for their 1st choice , their 2nd choice , 3rd choice , etc , and have those weighted appropriately and taken into account . historical context and potential solutions for improvement while there are tons of critiques with our voting system as it currently stands that one could argue would improve our ability to make our vote have more impact . a lot of these are valid . critiquing gerrymandering , the electoral college , bi-partisan politics , the way votes are counted , access to information , purposeful occlusion of information to reduce informed voting , and much much more . most of these systems exist in order to allow users to gain access and were created historically in order to better represent the voice of the common citizen . the electoral college had plenty of value in order to allow smaller populations to have a voice , to allow candidates to visit those states and influence them , and more … but in this day and age of near-equal access to information through the internet and an ability to inform oneself of the candidates and initiatives , these systems are outdated . ranked voting explained if you want more explanation beyond my simple sentence above on ranked voting , view this short explanation video , or this lengthier video about [ ranked video ( he calls this alternative vote ) by ccp gray ] ( -- url -- ) which includes some benefit analysis that ’s informative but ultimately not a critique of ranked voting . you could argue that we should remove bi-partisanship , or the electoral college , but ranked voting actually fixes most of those issues . with ranked voting : you no longer throw your “ independent vote ” away . you no longer have to choose the lesser of “ two evils ” . ranked voting could n’t exist , i do n’t think , even 50 years ago . as a research scientist who actually analyzes ranked choice responses , i can say first hand that it takes a bit more nuance than a simple voting count . thinking about doing it on a national level even 50 years ago sounds horrendous ! but with modern technology and computer calculations , it should be feasible . the only downside i see to this singular change that would be a negative impact is the demand on the voter to be more informed and have to evaluate a bit more candidates than they normally would . but say there are 10 candidates . 3 democrats , 5 republicans , and 2 independents . for democratically aligned voters , ranked choice could literally allow them to vote along party lines anyways . or they could mark the top spot as an independent , the next 3 spots as democrats , ignore all the rest , and place their worst candidate in the bottom spot . this still supports their normal party lines much more than our current system , and reduces the risk that they ever support such a candidate they definitely do n’t want ( which is what voting independent currently does ) . it also allows candidates , in turn , to feel more comfortable aligning with a party that is n’t the republican or democrat , because they know users could vote for them without throwing their vote away . the somewhat practical argument is that i do n’t believe our system is actually aligned to give voters the ability to voice their values , and the bi-partisan system is crafted to actually force a poor choice . i do n’t think that ’s entirely right , or a good thing , but it ’s a bit outside the scope of my argument . if there ’s a single change we embrace in our voting system , i would hope that it is ranked choice voting . please , change my view . arguments that would change my view : · support the argument that ranked voting would n’t change anything . · support the argument that ranked voting could be more abused than our current single-vote choice . · support the argument that another simple change or advocacy behind what we should change in our voting system is better and has the ability to allow voters to feel heard . · support the argument that voters should have less options and having their voice heard is n’t important . · something else i may have overlooked ! tl ; dr ranked choice is a voting system where in non-binary elections ( more than 2 selections ) , voters rank all of their options from best to worst . i believe this single change would lead to the most benefit across the american voting system by reducing bi-partisan choices , giving candidates the freedom to align with independent parties , and does n’t come bundled with many critiques . please , change my view .","let 's look at the last election ... for anyone who voted for trump , do you think they would have put hillary as a second choice ? and the same goes for people who voted for hillary , they pr9babpy would have just put bernie as their second choice . so im doubtful that it would affrct the % of votes goign to either the left or the right . bernie would certainly still have received some 1st choice votes , but hillary would have received more , as evidenced by the primaries . so if the frontrunners would n't have changed , and the % of votes going left vs right probably would n't have changed , i 'm doubtful the outcome of most elections ( key word , most ) would be any different . but in most elections , especially state and local , there are often only 2 choices , as other parties have so little support . many areas do n't even have a candidate running for say the green party , or libertarian party , and even then , many people would just vote for a 2nd republican or 2nd democrat rather than some thing different . the only major effect i can see happening is that it would eliminate the need for primaries , as that could be decided at the actual election . ranked choice voting allows the individual to express their opinion more fully , but still results in a flawed system where seats are not in proportion to votes and so there is less incentive to vote for third party candidates and so you do not get a political landscape filled with meaningful choices . to ensure a fair , ie proportionate , result and the pluralistic political landscape that comes with it , you need to use a form of proportional representation . there are lots and lots of different kinds , but ranked choice voting is not one . even though maine has shown a proclivity to support independent candidates in the past , there does not appear as though there will be a great surge in votes for independent candidates . at most , it might play a role in me-2 determine which major party ’s candidate will be elected . approval voting is way simpler for people to understand and execute correctly without spoiled ballots or problems like "" donkey voting "" ( look it up ) , and studies show that it has the same outcome as ranked choice almost all the time . so ranked choice is n't the simplest roughly equivalently effective change we could make . third parties are n't kept out of us politics because of our voting system , they 're kept out by the fact that we elect candidates in districts , rather than at large . if you voted for a party in your state or federal election , and each party got representatives proportional to the percentage of votes they got then 3rd parties would instantly have representation . there are very few instances in u.s. history where ranked choice voting would have actually elected a 3rd party candidate , but it might have changed which of the major party candidates got elected . if you think the major parties are all the same , this would not change anything . now ... one might argue , actually , that this is a good thing , and having only major parties is actually better ... because 3rd parties and proportional representation have a tendency to give extremists way more power than they "" deserve "" based on their support ... but at least it would work . approval voting is a great voting method which i strongly support , but i do n't think it 's quite the best option . specifically , i think star voting ( score then automatic runoff voting ) manages to outperform it . under star , voters rate each candidate on a scale that 's typically something like 0-5 . the ratings are added up , and the two candidates with the highest totals move on to a runoff . in the runoff , a voter 's ballot goes toward whichever candidate was rated higher . if both candidates were rated the same , then the voter abstains from the runoff . the candidate with the most votes in the runoff wins . there 's a detailed explanation here , but the gist is that a vse of 100 % means the voting method always picks the candidate that maximizes voter satisfaction , and a vse of 0 % means the voting method performs the same as randomly selecting a candidate ( in terms of voter satisfaction ) . for comparison , approval voting earns 85 % -96 % , single-winner ranked choice voting earns 80 % -91 % , and our current single-choice voting method only earns 72 % -86 % . there are other reasons to support star , such as its expressiveness ( each candidate gets their own score ) and resistance to strategy . i happen to think outcomes matter the most , but you may care about one of these properties more . ultimately , i think it makes sense to support both star and approval voting , as they are both major upgrades over the current method . p.s. lane county , oregon is voting on adopting star right now ! lincoln won the presidency in 1860 with barely 40 % of the popular vote . because the democrat party was split between north and south . had 2nd choices been taken into account , it 's likely lincoln would have lost , on favor of someone who was pro slavery ( southern dems ) , or at least someone who would have left the choice up to the individual states ( northern dems ) , in which case , who knows how much longer slavery would have lasted . actually , i would argue adopting proportional representation as a voting method is far more effective than alt . vote because not only does it create the same benefits you mention ( and even more effectively at that ) , but also offers a potential chance to remove an even bigger issue : gerrymandering . pr , by virtue of requiring multiple seats per district , requires a complete redrawing of the electoral , map meaning that house and senate districts have the chance to be redrawn from scratch , potentially without gerrymandering . the way it works is you vote for a candidate , then that candidate can , if they 're losing , trade your vote with other candidates . it 's extremely simple for voters , and it allows for compromise in a way that ranked voting does n't . asset voting elections allow losing candidates to still have a say on the result by influencing the winner to do things that the losing candidate 's voters want the government to do . in the end , this allows for exactly equal representation for every voter , because they get to vote for who they like with zero negative consequences , and the candidates they vote for get to influence the result on their voters ' behalf with zero dirty politics . just make the deals , then leave . this system would reduce the need for a candidate to have money or time to run , as they would n't have to run solely to win . it would let the common man have a say by encouraging anyone who wanted to run to take action . and it 'd give winning candidates cover to change their ideology while in office . winning candidates have the ability to pick which losers they make deals with , which lets them decide whose policies are best for them . this system also takes away the corrosive influence of party primaries , because here "" spoiler "" candidates are encouraged , they 're more like "" helpers ! "" finally , this system encourages majoritarian politics , but this majority is spread out into consensus . in other words , the candidates try to match the preferences of the voters as closely as possible , rather than trying to form a rigid majority with one "" group "" of voters or the other . the us politics have a lot of active political issues , that for simplicity 's sake i will consider one-dimensional - that is , voters are unable to disagree on one aspect of that issue , but agree on another . voters either agree on an issue , are close on it , or are opposed on it . a two-party political system forces parties to take a centrist-ish stance on most , if not all issues . their policies on most issues can be described as positioned around the center . so , for example , even the democrats will probably shut down a repeal of the second amendment , and even the republicans will probably shut down a proposal to repeal the separation between church and state . this means that , even though the modern political system results in a gridlock , the two political parties can find an agreement around the center of the political spectrum on most issues , if need pressing enough . that would mean the republicans and democrats are losing their voters to new political parties . as both republicans and democrats are relatively centrist , all the new parties will be pushed to be more extreme on the new issues . also , having more political parties would mean that , instead of one party being in power , congress would rely on coalitions , and on coalition members sticking with the coalitions and not switching to the opposition if they do n't like something . both of those could increase the legislative gridlock , and cripple the us 's legislative response to most issues , thus harming the popular trust in government and make the parties more extreme , which cripples the congress even more and results in a positive feedback loop . i feel like we 're forgetting a super important fact here , the only way the voting system will change is if the winning party decides to change the system . no party in power has ever not exploited the system after being in power , that 's how this works . if you want to have this system implemented , you need either the loser party to win ( essentially impossible ) or for there to be a minority government coalition ( actually impossible in the us ) . we were supposed to change voting system with trudeau back when he thought he 'd get a minority government . what about voting on each law instead of electing representatives , combined with an easier way to vote , aided by technology ? \ - i 'll admit this has issues with the "" vocal minority "" , but that 's only an issue if there is some inherent barrier to voting . if technology makes voting easy for everyone , anyone not voting has only themselves to blame . \ - i 'll also admit that technology-aided voting is more tricky than i make it out to be . \ - i 'd say that people voting with uninformed opinions is an issue with this , but that is even more an issue with representatives , because they can ( and do ) vote based on self interest rather than facts . the one i want to bring up in particular though is that it 's impossible for all of their constituents ' voices to be heard unless they all agree . having everyone vote on everything automatically makes every voice heard though . if it ’s incorporated by each state using a ranked system to choose where the electorates vote , then i agree , but have a few ideas to add . first and foremost , every state would n’t necessarily need to implement this system in the same election cycle . in fact , the feds leave how states choose to use their electorates up to the states . if , for example , wyoming ( completely random example ) has some kind of crazy revolution in which a king of wyoming was crowned , legally he alone could choose to decide if he got the proper legislation passed . another state could continue to use fptp , while another adopts ranked voting , and still another could give the electorates proportionally to the votes cast ( ie 50 % of the votes gets 50 % of the electorates ) . "" best "" implies the most effective route toward a particular goal . you have n't really said what your goal is here , but i would figure it 's something along the lines of eliminating the two-party hold on american politics . to that end , i think there is a more direct , and simpler route : remove the party identification from all ballots . but it 's simpler to implement and far more likely to actually happen , so i think that makes it a better method , simply on feasibility alone . removing the little ( d ) and ( r ) next to someone 's name would force them to actually do some research into what someone stands for . at the moment , probably 90-95 % of the country has already decided who they 're voting for , even if they do n't know who is running . they 're going to vote for the person who has an ( r ) next to their name , or a ( d ) next to their name . that 's as much thought as they care to put into it , and we 've made it so that they do n't have to put any more thought into it . even if people still wanted to vote on party lines , they 'd have to at least figure out who those people are , which would be infinitely more research than they 're doing now ."
9ugadj,"illegal immigration is a crime and should be treated as such . first off , let me be very clear that i fully support legal immigration . those that put in the work , make the sacrifices , and do the steps required to legally emigrate get my utmost respect . my problem is with those that decide to enter the country illegally , and those that choose to support it . i know there are some circumstances in which people seek asylum ( although thats an entirely different issue ) and for now should be respected , i 'm referring to those who just chooses to come and expect to stay . i have really tried to understand the logic behind the support , and that of "" sanctuary cities "" and i can not see it . very few countries openely allow open borders , and those that do have strict rules . so why should the us be expected to be different ? i admit that the rules if immigration are difficult and antiquated , but thats no excuse to decide you 're more important that those that do it the right way .","first , you implied that asylum seekers are a subset of illegal immigrants . second , you imply that the us has , or supports , open borders . in fact , if the us did have open borders , then we would have no illegal immigrants . open borders means that anyone and everyone can come to the country legally with no barriers to entry . the simple fact that illegal immigration is possible shows that the us does not have open borders . it 's also a myth ( although not one you brought up here ) that the democratic party wants open borders . as to your question , why do some parts of the country and some people support illegal immigrants , mostly it 's due to pragmatism and human rights . there are something like 11.5 million undocumented immigrants in the us right now . let 's say we were able to , overnight , arrest , detain , and deport all 11.5 million ( ignore the logistics for a moment , we 'll get to that ) , effectively removing them from the economy . in short , the us depends on the labor of undocumented immigrants , and we can not do without it . now , getting to the logistics of actually arresting and deporting undocumented immigrants . there is simply no economically feasible way to force a migration of 11.5 million people without grossly violating their human rights . you 'd have to create a system to process them ( verify the people you are deporting are actually undocumented immigrants , verify what country they 're being deported to , etc ) , which would require hiring hundreds , if not thousands , of lawyers , judges , administrators , law enforcement officers , etc . the questions go on and on , but the main point is that simply getting rid of illegal immigrants is both harmful to the us economy , incredibly expensive , and a logistical nightmare . so we 've come to the point where we have to accept that some portion , probably a majority , of undocumented immigrants have to stay here . when you get down to pragmatically what that actually means , though , it is impossible to enact in anyway which is n't both harmful to the us and violates human rights . pro business republicans liked the supply of labor , and pro diversity democrats did n't like the idea of restricting the flow of people . however , the social conservative right and the pro labor left have n't been keen on the idea of expanded immigration that would bring more non english speakers into the country and increase labor supply . you created a situation where there was a massive labor surplus on one side of the border and a huge labor demand on the other , with a long , somewhat protected border , and virtually no legal recourse to fill both of those needs . employers we 're happy to hire mexican and central american workers regardless of their immigration status when they would work hard and for less than their native born counterparts . think of the direct cost of deporting 11 million people , and the indirect cost removing 11 million workers , consumers , and tax payers from the economy ? ( yes , they pay sales and property tax , and if they are working in fake papers , they pay into social security , medicare , and payroll taxes ) . after 30 years of illegal immigration , we have a situation where there are entire communities with mixed legal status . the problem with criminalizing illegal immigration now is that you 're only punishing one party for everyone 's actions , decades after the fact , when those people are in a much more difficult situation than if they had been kicked out immediately after they got in , or if they had never been allowed to enter or find work in the first place . the main argument as i understand it , is how many resources we should use to enforce the law , and whether or not it ’s productive to actively dispand families who have been here for years and are ( generally ) established in their local economies . supporting complete open borders without rules would be a rather extreme , rare view to hold . despite our speech against it , when we vote with our dollars we support illegal immigration . to me personally , it 's pretty clear that his opposition to immigration is pretty much entirely based on race , not on actually solving the problem . legally immigrating to the united states is a huge hassle , to the point of being impossible for many people from poorer countries . and the reason for that , to me , is clear : they do n't want people legally immigrating here from mexico either , they just ca n't say that out loud . it 's why republicans are up in arms about keeping them out , and it 's why democrats ca n't wait to get them in . harping on about immigration ( and specifically mexican immigration ) gets them riled up , and it gets them to go vote . however , a deeper question is whether it should be a crime . while there are some short run localized negative externalities associated with immigrants , the majority of metrics , even relatively localized , improve from immigration . leaving aside the crime of crossing the border , an illegal immigrant , on average , commits fewer crimes than native born folk . people integrate with time , as has been shown again and again in the past , and , if culture changes somewhat , is that really that bad ? basically if there is a clear asylum path ( there is n’t one now ) that provides safety to people in trouble trying to escape evil then yes we should enforce stronger border laws but not until then so , sure ... we should treat these crimes with as much seriousness as we treat all victimless crimes : i.e. only spend resources on them if we can either recoup it from fines ( like speeding , which is honestly more serious than illegal immigration , in that there 's at least an argument that you 're endangering someone ) or for times when the police do n't have anything better to do . it would n't be called illegal immigration if people did n't think it was a crime . are you sure you want to talk about whether or not illegal immigration is a crime and not whether it should be right or wrong in some specific cases ? additionally , you can not apply for asylum from outside of the united states , or at least can not do so except for at a port of entry . if this does n't make sense , consider that people who are applying for asylum are very likely to be fleeing dangerous or failed states , and even if they had the resources to do so ( which would require reliable internet or mail service ) , it is absurd to expect them to wait for an official response ( especially since applying for asylum in this way may itself be risky for that citizen ) . so people travelling to the united states to apply for asylum ( which the us does n't have to grant ) are perfectly within their rights to do so , because it 's considered a good and moral thing to at minimum not punish people fleeing from dangerous and unlivable areas . as far as sanctuary cities themselves go , the thought process behind them is that in many areas , undocumented immigrants or people subject to deportation are nonetheless properly integrated within society and an important part of the city . if local authorities attach citizenship questions to tax collection , policing , etc. they will cause some portion of the population to go further off the grid . this has tons of negative knock-on effects , preventing undocumented residents of a city from reporting crimes and forcing revenue "" off-the-books "" , which are far more detrimental to the city than some number of residents being subject to federal deportation . finally , just to address the last bit of rhetoric : the people who wind up undocumented in the united states have nothing to do with the people who wind up in the united states through documented means . the people who are here undocumented are not in any way basing their decision off of being "" too important "" for the regular process , especially when it comes to asylum seekers . - crossing the border without permission is a crime , but a misdemeanor the first time . there is no way to apply for asylum outside the u.s. except at a port of entry , and more and more often , ports of entry have simply been closed or made people wait . this has led to people increasingly crossing the border and then applying for asylum , which is not a crime , because applying for asylum is legal no matter how you made it into the country . the idea of a sanctuary city is primarily motivated by the fact that police resources are limited and illegal immigration is a minor crime . police will still go after illegal immigrants who commit other crimes , the sanctuary city label just means that they wo n't be explicitly putting police time and effort into enforcing immigration law . furthermore , it is believed that sanctuary polices improve policing , because otherwise undocumented people wo n't contact the police and work with them on other crimes . what i have a problem with is when some idiot decides to devote limited law enforcement resources to specifically hunt down and catch illegal immigrants when there are far bigger fish to fry . these actions also involve a lot of racial profiling and have caught up completely innocent people . sure , if cbp catches people attempting to cross at the border , deport them . if you catch someone for an unrelated offense like a dui and it turns out they have no papers , deport them . but do n't waste my tax dollars trying to hunt down the janitor who does n't have papers when there are more serious crimes to take care of first . think of it like fixing an old beater car with a limited budget . obviously anyone with common sense would prioritize things like tires and brakes and the engine , and if there 's no more money left , then minor nuisances like a headliner rattle or a paintwork scratch will go ignored until the next budget . the current obsession with illegal immigration is equivalent to throwing money at fixing the rattles and scratches while the important stuff risks getting neglected . people are calling to abolish ice not because they want open borders ( if they did , they 'd also want to abolish cbp , ins , and uscis ) , but because ice has been needlessly aggressive , has a bad habit of racial profiling ( not just with arpaio - innocents get caught up all the time just because they 're hispanic ) , and many of its raids are not actually helping anyone ( it 's not like a us citizen will rush to take that deported janitor 's job ) . i think heroin use should be illegal , but i do n’t think law enforcement should focus on the users — law enforcement should focus on smugglers , dealers and cartels . i think prostitution should be illegal , but i do n’t think law enforcement should focus on the sex workers , but rather on human traffickers , pimps , johns and others who exploit them . i think illegal immigration should be illegal , but i do n’t want law enforcement focusing on the immigrants , but rather the coyotes , the human traffickers , and the businesses who profit off of illegal immigration ."
9ufl2z,"there ’s nothing wrong with conventional ideas of sexuality some people within the lbgt + community push the idea that sexual orientations are a spectrum ; they believe that labels like “ heterosexual ” or “ gay ” are too limiting . i get that there ’s research that shows that sexuality is more complicated than people consciously think , like kinsey scale stuff and with how heterosexual people are aroused by all types of pornography . does that therefore mean that we need to break out of the limits of sexuality ? i would argue no , it does n’t . if the traditional notions of sexuality work for you , that ’s fine . if they do n’t , then that ’s also fine . who you choose to sleep with should be up to you and is solely your business ( we are strictly talking about consenting adults here ) . for some reason , it seems like this obvious point gets lost every time someone talks about trans people . yes , there is certainly some transphobia going on when people say they do n’t want to date trans people . but there ’s more to it than that if the person ’s genitals are involved , like with a trans woman with a penis . having or not having a vagina is an important factor ; genitals fundamentally impact the sexual acts that can be performed . by this metric , it would not be discrimination to not be interested in this person . yes , i might be attracted to the person , but i am attracted to others as well , and if others have the genitals i most desire , well , they are more attractive . attraction is to gender and sex , and has a definite biological factor to it . imposing any requirement that i be “ open-minded ” about my sexuality is a blatant violation of the freedom of expression that lbgt + people in particular fight for . it ’s the exact reverse of the sexual orientation and gender identity business that ’s been so contentious : i might be “ biologically bisexual , ” as in i could be attracted to both guys and girls if i had to be . but if i find girls significantly more attractive , and girls with vaginas even more so , there ’s nothing wrong with stipulating that i only want to sleep with girls that have vaginas . i thus identify as heterosexual , because i find women with vaginas most attractive . if i only want to explore this major aspect of my sexuality , i am at liberty to do so . once again , if we turned this around and told gay people to be “ open-minded ” about having sex with women , that would n’t fly . i do n’t see why the reverse of insinuating that heterosexual people should be less straight , so to speak , flies any more . in general , the problem i have with some lbgt + movements is their insistence that society needs to fundamentally change . yes , clearly not everyone is heterosexual , and not everyone even identifies as male or female . but that does not mean that those things are bad . most people are those things , and it makes a lot of sense to organize our society in the way we do . sexuality , sex , and gender are bound up together because they usually describe different aspects of the same thing . a big purpose of gender is to basically mark which people have to genitals you are interested in . unless we decide to stop wearing clothes , wear genital id badges , or casually ask each other about anatomy upon first meeting each other , this stays as a function of gender . that is why i believe it ’s reasonable to expect that people are heterosexual and cisgender ; nothing wrong if you are n’t , but most people are , which forms the basis for society . i believe that with all these things , it is a largely individual freedom : if societal norms about sex , gender , and sexuality do n’t work for you , you are free to figure out your own path . but like political and religious minorities and anti-establishment groups like the hippies , your rejection of societal norms does not entitle you to reform society as you please . instead , we coexist and respect each others ’ choices even if we disagree . cmv","it is n't necessarily transphobic to find a trans person unattractive , but it is certainly transphobic to categorically deny the possibility of being attracted to a trans person . i get the impression that you already understand this concept , like the difference between saying "" i 've never met a person of \ [ ethnicity \ ] i found attractive "" and "" no person of \ [ ethnicity \ ] can ever be attractive "" . if there was a hypothetical trans person who had functionally identical ( for non-procreative purposes ) genitals , and was unclockable without specialised equipment or tests . finding them less attractive than you would an identical looking cis person is transphobic . i 'm going to put myself out there and get a bit controversial for a second though but ... being a little bit transphobic in this way does n't make you a bad person . obviously real life interactions with people and relationships are complex , you will probably never find yourself in a situation where two exactly equal candidates with one critical control variable are competing for your sex ( but hey , it could happen ) . in real life , people have all sorts of stuff going on , there many factors that influence how attractive you might find them that goes way beyond the number of orifices they have , like personality , sense of humor , height , age , weight , strength , flexibility , specific facial features , hair etc. obviously the importance of the different factors can vary considerably from person to person , in your case , it 's ok to not be into the d. i think the lesson that you 're supposed to take from the lgbt + movement ( which is far too divided and diverse a movement to really do justice in a sentence ) is to learn to identify , and be more conscious of your biases , so that you can strive to be better . does everyone need to identify with their preferred pronouns and provide a picture of their genitals whenever they introduce themselves ? as far as i 'm concerned , the reason society needs to fundamentally change is because there are people who : unless you belong to one of those groups , then just like , be aware of the movement , introspect a bit and try to be aware of your own biases and prejudices ( we probably all have some ) and strive to be better . but also you seem to already be aware that marking your genitals is not the only purpose of gender . i 'm pretty certain that in a situation where a person who 's genitals did n't conform to their gender identity was sexually interested in you , and they thought you were sexually interested in them then you would be made aware of their situation in some way or another . obviously you ca n't be attracted to chromosomes , because you ca n't see or test for those . if they tell you that their body was once different , do you now reject them , even though you were 100 % attracted to them at first ? when society actually does condemn people for their sexuality , it 's really society that has to change . no one is insisting that you become gay or trans -- they are insisting that you do n't judge them and treat them differently outside of sexual relationships than you would any other person . for instance , if you said you had sex with a man/woman/trans person being a man/woman/trans person and did not like it , i do n't think the "" lbgt + community "" in a broad sense would have a problem with your statement . now , if you said you would never even consider having sex with a man/woman/trans person only because you are a man/woman/trans person that would raise eyebrows . now , if i say i have never even considered eating pudding because \ [ reasons \ ] than there is no way you will not be seen as a close-minded person . the issue here is not the eating of the pudding ( you have n't eaten any pudding in both cases ) the problem arises when you will not even think about the putting the pudding in your mouth , you will not allow the thought to cross your mind - that is what is perceived as wrong . it 's also really ironic that you end your post by suggesting that we all coexist and respect each other after you spent several hundred words essentially arguing a bunch of False things about the lgbt community and suggesting that they 're the weird ones and they should just keep their heads down and not rock the boat . i think the counter is this , nobody ( at least nobody reasonable ) is asking society to change other than to just treat people with respect and dignity - if that is the reform in question then ya i think that ’s totally legitimate . i am not sure what the presence of a spectrum takes away from your identity as ( i assume ) a straight person on one end of the spectrum . the fundamental difference is that your binary model attempts to invalidate other people 's sexual and/or gender identities , whereas the spectrum model recognizes everyone 's identity . people may urge you to recognize you are in a privileged class , and try to show you how being straight affords you some benefits that others do n't get . almost nobody ( bar maybe a few fringe crazies on twitter ) would insist that all people must be willing to sleep with a trans person . a common debate you will see is "" what if the trans person was indistinguishable , genitals and all , from the sex you are attracted to "" . it 's a common thought experiment to expose our biases . if i find myself attracted to someone who is trans and i have no way of telling they are trans even after seeing them naked , then is it reasonable for me to have a negative reaction upon finding out they are trans . while i am perfectly entitled to sleep with who i want to sleep with , and nobody is arguing that people should n't be , that does n't mean i am not being transphobic if i do have a negative reaction in that situation . this type of debate is not designed to guilt or bully anyone into sleeping with someone they do n't want to , it 's designed to challenge biases , make people question why they feel a certain way etc ."
9uf0fw,"as an american catholic who likes most of the democratic party 's platform , i should vote republican because of key issues like abortion . i support most of the democratic party 's platform except where it seems directly opposed to church teaching as outlined in the catechism of the catholic church . & #x200b ; ultimately i think the church 's teaching is the most important consideration for me as a voter . & #x200b ; there is n't a perfect candidate ( that i 'm aware of ) and because of the quirks of our legal system , i believe i should vote for the "" lesser of two evils "" and vote for one of the two most popular candidates for any given election . & #x200b ; abortion is something very deeply opposed by the catholic church . i view it as something akin to the killing of an innocent person who 's life is pretty irrelevant to mine , but valuable nonetheless . logically , it seems to me to be something like any other unjust killings that are emotionally distant to me . however , it 's scale is ridiculously large . & #x200b ; i do n't think my view can be changed on any of these previously listed considerations , but i can not come to a firm conclusion on which party actually represents my views the closest . i want to do a sort of utilitarian weighing of the probable effect of outcomes ( as if my vote would decide the elections ) and pick the one that seems better . & #x200b ; generally i lean republican because abortion is the single most important issue to me , but i realize there 's a question of efficacy with the republican party on that platform . other important issues to me : protection of the environment ; provisions for healthcare , education , and opportunity for all ; elimination of the death penalty ; a charitable resolution to gay marriage in line with church teaching ( i 'd love to see anybody with a viable plan here ) ; minimization of the "" imperial "" army ; and a distributionist economic model . there 's a lot that 's missing and i do n't exactly understand how much of this could feasibly fit together , but i hope that gives a bit of insight into my political views . i 'd be open to my view being changed about specific elections in south dakota or about general support across the country . & #x200b ; the tl : dr of it is the democratic party represents a lot of my political beliefs really well , but abortion is too important of an issue . the marginal benefits of electing republicans to eliminate abortion is worth the more significant costs to other less important issues . change my view .","i think after reasoning with someone like me , who has reasoned about faith , you will no longer find abortion a binary voting issue . i understand that abortions are important to you but i would consider a few things : abortions have been falling steadily for 40 years , so the problem is getting better , not worse . two of the best ways to reduce abortion are through sex ed and free contraception , and republican policies consistently make these both more difficult to access . - i am an ex catholic so i do understand the church . - if you are pro-life then i am not here to change your mind but if you want to use the bible as a reason then the bible does not say anything about abortion . the miscarriage is treated differently , however — as property loss , not murder . - despite the bible not mentioning abortion , the church is clear about it so you have a right to vote based on what the church teaches , however , if you want to compare which party represents the values of the church then i would say go with democrats . - look at the sermon on the mount - the beatitudes . i think this represents what a christian should believe from the prospective of the the church . what most democrats seek to do is insure that abortion remains a last resort , and that resources are in place for women and couples to avoid needing them in the first place : things like birth control and comprehensive sex education . not all republicans are opposed to those things , but some of them are , and you will find a lot more republicans opposed to them than democrats . moreover , in the long term , if you 're worried about reducing the loss of innocent life , you should be voting for politicians who care about the other things you care about as well : reducing the degradation of the environment , increasing access to healthcare , and a fairer distribution of economic resources . because preventing those things kill people who 've committed no grave sin as well , and its far more likely that a democrat will support those ideals that a republican will . so you want to vote to make the world worse for everyone general because it will make it worse for women in specific ? so as far as i understand it , as a catholic you believe god will be the ultimate judge of a person when they die . no matter what is legal or illegal if it is against gods law they will be punished . should n’t it be the case that you should be worried about individuals getting abortions getting punished by god rather then the secular legality of it ? on the other hand democrats want to create government programs to provide healthcare for example . - i am an ex catholic so i do understand the church . - if you are pro-life then i am not here to change your mind but if you want to use the bible as a reason then the bible does not say anything about abortion . the miscarriage is treated differently , however — as property loss , not murder . - despite the bible not mentioning abortion , the church is clear about it so you have a right to vote based on what the church teaches , however , if you want to compare which party represents the values of the church then i would say go with democrats . - look at the sermon on the mount - the beatitudes . i think this represents what a christian should believe from the prospective of the the church . abstinence-only sex ed and reduced access to birth controls increase the risk of unwanted pregnancies . cuts to social programs make it more expensive for the poor to raise children . these things in turn lead to more demand for abortions and more abortions occurring . by voting republican because you 're pro-life , you prioritize appearance vs reality when it comes to actually reducing the number of abortions that occur . because it seems like your best case scenario is to be registered democrat and attempt to vote for pro-life candidates in the democratic primary , even if you end up voting for the republican in the general election . ultimately , your view appears pretty consistent with itself so it 's going to be very hard to change it . if abortion is , effectively , the issue that outweigh all others , then i 'm not sure what we can do to help change your view . one thing i can say , however , is that going about the abortion question with outright bans is just one way to see the issue and not necessarily the best or most efficient way . i think comprehensive sexual education and easily accessible birth control are also a good ways to cut into abortion numbers , while being much less restrictive for people than outright bans . you could vote for these , which will likely reduce abortions and other reproductive health problems , while also supporting the other issues you care about . that could be your b option , as opposed to the a option - voting republicans hoping to get a ban on abortion - which does n't give you much of anything , i think . banning abortion appears to be much harder and less efficient than reducing the need for it . so , if we take abortion as the key issue that causes you to vote republican , what would change your mind ? when pro-life advocates push to make abortion illegal , it turns out that they do n't actually reduce the numbers of abortions . basically , it discusses the fact that the places with the highest abortion rates also have the strictest anti-abortion laws -- the laws do n't change the fact that women are going to get abortions , they just make it more dangerous to do so . instead , to reduce the number of abortions you should look to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies . per this study , women who have access to and consistently and correctly use contraception only account for 5 % of all unintended pregnancies . so it makes sense that , to reduce unintended pregnancies , you should promote policies such as better sex ed ( so people know what is available and how to use it correctly ) and better and cheaper access to contraception ( so people actually have contraception to use ) . i know i 'm a bit late to the party , but i want to focus on one specific aspect for a bit . given that it does n't do anyone any harm to wear them , it 'd be reasonable to say people should be able to wear them even though one specific religion ( yours in this case ) happens to think it 's immoral . so if a candidate appeared that had every policy perfect to you including reducing abortion , except that they were a proponent of mixed fabrics , you would be willing to vote for them , right ? yes , your personal beliefs might be against them , but they do n't do anyone any harm , and it 's only specific religions that have beliefs against them . so it strikes me , by the same logic as before , if a candidate appeared that had every policy perfect to you including reducing abortion , except that they were a proponent of contraception , you should be willing to vote for them , because contraceptives fall in the same category as mixed fabrics ( immoral according to the bible , but not to every religion , and do n't do any harm ) . if you 'll accept this logic , then the choice becomes clear : vote democratic , and let the democratic policies lower the abortion rate . it might not be illegal , but the result is the same : less abortions . if you do n't accept this logic , then it seems to me that you 're voting for a catholic theocracy , in which case ..... you 're probably in the wrong country for that . it 's important to remember that when talking about government policies , the thing you want to think about is n't "" what is the best way to live ? "" but the church 's teaching is not one of those arguments . it is unreasonable to expect non-catholic people to live by catholic doctrine , just like it would be unreasonable for you to follow hindu doctrine if you lived in india . i 'm religious , so i get that religion has a major impact on how you value certain things , and that 's going to influence how you vote . but when voting because of policies that determine how other people live , you should make sure that you have a reason for that which does n't rely on a religious basis . anti-abortion is a big issue that they milk for religious supporters who may otherwise vote democratic , voters just like you . there is n't any verifiable way to prove that this is the republican party 's strategy , but if it were ever time to make that decision , it is arguable that they would rather keep the single issue voters on abortion on-board than to never gain a majority in congress or win the executive without a major shift to the middle . it seems like everyone else here has pretty succinctly covered my main problems with your argument : that restricting abortion only increases illegal and unsafe abortions , that there are much more large scale issues that would affect greater numbers of people , and that it 's hard to be a utilitarian who is also inflexible about their stance on a problem . i will say this though : you 've asked several times for some sort of predictive numbers that you can compare to the number of abortions that have already happened . there is no such thing as an accurate "" this is how many lives that democratic policies will save "" number , and in fact i doubt any predictions would be even sort of accurate . to figure out that number would basically require knowledge of the future , to account for economic conditions , changing political situations , and other acts of god , which is impossible . if there were clear analyses of the human cost/benefit to government policy , there would n't really be a need to vote , because you could just always go for the option that saves the most life . however there is n't , which is why voters like you have to decide not only what stances are important to you , but how important they are compared to everything else . no matter which way you end up going , i hope you get out and vote on nov 6 ! what do you think that the republicans are going to be able to do in order to change the status quo about abortion . currently there is a legal right , established by the supreme court in roe v. wade for women to be able to have an abortion . you would need 3/4 of the states to be able to vote for it . you voting for a republican wo n't change this in any way . so your issue here is basically in a fixed state . i used to be protestant which shares a lot of ideology with catholics . if you want to vote republican simply because of abortion then you are missing a ton of the teaching of christ . jesus taught a lot about caring for the poor , caring for each other , not passing judgment , etc . a lot of the things jesus taught are in direct conflict with the modern republican party . to say that abortion is the key issue as a catholic kind of shows that your issues is more about abortion than following your religion 's teachings . i do n't know if someone has already made this point , but there is a major flaw in how you see the republican versus the democrat parties ' stances on abortion . making abortion illegal as the republicans wish to do will never stop abortions . it simply makes them unsafe and results in more death of both the mothers and the fetuses . by advocating for the outlawing of abortion , you 're advocating for more deaths , not less at all . democrats are not necessarily pro-abortion . they are pro-choice , and they are pro-preventing abortions which the republican party utterly fails to address . the only real way to stop abortions is to address why they happen in the first place , which the republican party stubbornly has refused to do for decades . abortions happen because women lack access to birth control , sex education , and other family planning services . abortions happen because women do not have access to prenatal healthcare to have a successful full-term pregnancy . in fact , the united states has the highest rate of infant mortality and women dying from complications of pregnancy in the first world . abortions happen because women - particularly single mothers - do n't have maternity leave , access to daycare , or access to other welfare programs like food stamps to help them take care of an unwanted and unplanned child . so basically , you vote for the party who wants to make abortion illegal to punish women rather than focusing on how to prevent the many circumstances that drive women into desperation to seek out abortions in the first place . it 's just a way to control and punish women , not save lives or stop abortions from happening . other topics you care about sum to y % of the total importance this assumes that you are voting to express your own conscience rather than optimizing the probability that your values will truly be put into legislation . if you want to include that aspect , estimate the probability of that viewpoint coming to bear and multiply it by your x and y above . i 'd argue that the second way of viewing this the more fruitful way to look at it , but it 's way harder to estimate , and can potentially sacrifice your ethics in light of the reality of being able to put those ethics into legislation . as others have said , there is basically a 0 % chance of outlawing abortion any time soon in the united states . so if you are using my second calculation strategy , then voting dem automatically wins , because no matter how you vote , you will never stop abortion . while i disagree with you on abortion itself , i 'll put that aside for a moment . consider this : blasphemy against god is also something deeply opposed by the catholic church , but practically no one wants to make it illegal . why ca n't your position be something like "" abortion is wrong and should be stopped , however , criminalizing it is not an effective solution "" ? church teaching says that the sacrament of marriage is n't available to same-sex couples . it absolutely does not say that the civil institution of marriage , which shares a name with the sacrament but is not the same thing , is n't available to same-sex couples . the catholic church teaches that a zygote is a “ person ” because “ ensoulment ” occurs at the point of conception . generally , it ’s defined as being the “ essence of a person ” ; although , occasionally some other equally vague , woolly definition is provided . if you asked me what is meant by the “ essence of person ” i would say this refers to a person ’s character ( i.e. are they introverted or extroverted , are they sombre or happy go lucky etc. ) but clearly this does n’t apply to a zygote . therefore , as belief in a “ soul ” is purely a matter of faith , you would be restricting the bodily autonomy of others based on a position which is deeply illogical . i 'm going to just focus on the fact that you say you take a utilitarian viewpoint on this , and you take the teaching of the bible to be serious , which i doubt , because everyone cherry picks . first , you support an institution which is guilty of covering up , sheltering and protecting people who have sexual abused children , does this not impact your decision as to their doctrine or make you question whether they know what 's morally correct and best ? the church took their position on abortion to ensure that catholicism continues to be the largest sect of christianity , that 's it . republicans do not support comprehensive sex education , which is actually shown to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies , so ultimately you will have more abortions as a result of their policies . in addition , outlawing abortion does not equal ending abortion , you just push people into using less than ideal sources , which will lead to mothers dying of complication of illegal abortions . rich women will still be able to get them by going to another country that is n't plagued by backwards secular thought . also , you acknowledge that republican policies are killing the planet , aiding to the gap between rich and poor , increasing the chance we go to war , etc . so i guess it 's cool if huge numbers of people die ( war/madd/climate change/poverty ) as a result of their policies , as long as women ca n't control their own bodies and make the decision of when it is a good time for them emotionally and fiscally to have a child . i am not catholic anymore , but i once was and had my mind changed as to political leanings by one thing . republicans control the senate , the house , and the executive branch , and nothing has been done to curb abortions . in addition to that , republicans are against key measures that are proven to reduce abortions , such as encouraging condom use in sex ed and expanding it past being ' abstinence class . ' people in poverty are more likely to perform abortions , and modern republican policy , as you are aware , does not do much to help the poor , which is a staple catholic belief . thus , abortion has to be treated as a lost cause if you are opposed to it , since even in heavily catholic regions like ireland , it is becoming legal . thus , it is better for catholics to vote for candidates that support the greatest number of their core beliefs , which , in many races right now , is the democrat . pope francis has made his feelings about republicans , donald trump in particular , quite clear . francis is against border walls , is pro-environment/believes in anthropogenic climate change , believes in a social safety net for the poor , and does not approve of trump being on his third wife ( and trump 's ambassador to the vatican being newt gingrich 's third wife . ) pope francis allowed an issue of la civilta cattolica to criticize the protestant evangelical view of the american dream . the catholic church under pope francis has definitely moved away from support for conservative american politics . yes , catholics are against abortion , but the pope appears to believe that concern for the poor , social policies that fight income inequality , favoring immigrant rights , and overall a more liberal view are more catholic stances . social justice has always been an important part of catholicism . think of the nuns on the bus , catholic sisters protesting republican tax policy . it might go away on the federal level , but there are still states where it will be legal . focus on the good you could do for the poor and less fortunate via better health care , a social safety net , and less draconian immigration laws . think of the family separation policy -- suffer the little children indeed . the only way abortion law is likely to change nationally is through the supreme court . so i guess you could support democrats in congress and republicans or pro life democrats exclusively for senate and president . i do n't see any rules have to be broken for your choices against your political party . it 's your own choice and you vote for what you like , your belief , and your voice . i could be wrong , but most republican candidates who are pro-life nonetheless are firmly pro-death penalty . so just starting knowing that either way , you ’re making an imperfect choice . i strongly respect pro-life viewpoints , but wish that people who held them did more to prevent abortion as private citizens as opposed to lobbying to make them illegal . this has been a wedge issue forever , and it seems like the gop is content to score your vote based on abortion but unlikely to do much to actually impact how many abortions are performed . if you recognize that abortion is likely to remain legal , but want to see them reduced or eliminated as a matter of choice , support : - free speech to voice your opinion on the morality of abortion to potential mothers - access to affordable or subsidized healthcares , both for women of childbearing age and children - access to affordable or subsidized childcare , food stamps , temporary cash and housing assistance tldr : democratic policies do much more to reduce abortion than republicans efforts research from the gutenmacher institutes 2014 survey showed that access to affordable and effective birth control was the biggest factor in reducing abortion since the nineties . so democratic policies , like obamacare and women 's rights have done more to reduce abortion rates than republicans have ever achieved trying to curttail access . there have been numerous times when republicans have controlled one or both houses and nobody was able to bring illegalizing abortion to a vote . this tells me it is not a top priority for the gop . plus republican social , economic , environmental , and international policies have led directly to so much misery , sin , death and illness . i 'm sure you know the catechism teaches that up to deadly force is justified when preventing mortal sin . if we are talking about preventing institutionalized poverty , oppression and exploitation of your fellow man that republican policies breed , i think voting for keeping abortion legal is justified . plus , if republicans ever got off their asses and made abortion effectively illegal with all their new provisions that close clinics or prevent hospitals from performing abortions , then we would still have desperate women taking parsley tea , throwing themselves downstairs , taking drugs , or submitting themselves to the ministrations of some back alley opportunist with a coat hanger . republicans do n't care about these issues so they ca n't really end abortion . keep it legal , but institute democratic social policies to reduce it to a rare option . neither party will end abortion but democratic policies can make it to where any women who finds she is pregnant can feel safe and secure in having a baby ; so that abortion is the least attractive option . when i consider this i also consider how the church ignores that their dogma does not address fertility clinics equally as abortion clinics . to produce fertilized eggs by the dogma is to create life with souls . i feel ( and this may convince you of nothing at all ) that if life is conception and all innocent life must be defended the church should rail against fertility rights as much as they do abortion . i suspect there is either an issue to control women , or politics to give a voting block a specific edict to keep votes . it can though when you consider a particular party member and know they vote pro life , but in general are despicable in personal life ( like many politicians . i ’m not taking a stab here ) then i think on that particular person you can vote with conscience for a different party . in the ‘ 50 ’s we used to flop a lot and hold our parties responsible . in the us your church ca n’t inform you how to vote . that ’s a separation of church and state on the church side that should be enforced from inside the church . if your priests or lay people are informing you how to vote there is a political issue at hand . the best way to decrease the number of abortions may be to attack the underlying causes of people seeking abortions . based on this survey , 23 % of respondents said financial constraints were their main motivation to have an abortion . you said that "" provisions for healthcare , education , and opportunity for all "" is important to you ."
9uez8v,"u.s. citizens trust the government too much to change problems . if we care about an issue we should volunteer and donate to make a difference ourselves . i am a progressive . i voted for every democrat on my ballot . i 'm only saying this to let you guys know i am not blasting anyone for lobbying and voting for issues that they care about . we all know problems are multifaceted . both the system and the individual is at fault . now that i got that out of the way . i think many of us in the u.s. , especially progressives , trust the government too much to solve the issues we care about . to be honest i have lost nearly all faith in this country . our government will never be perfect and will never fix every problem we have . i 've started volunteering at an agency that helps the homeless in my area . this organization has been responsible for helping many homeless become self-sufficient . vote , lobby , spread awareness . that 's great , but get your hands dirty and do the work your self . if you care about the immigrant , the lgbtq , the environment , abortion , and poverty get involved in your community . there are many agencies that are involved in solving the problem you care so deeply about . donate and volunteer . if you see a need is not being met locally start filling that need . we need all hands on deck guys . do n't rely on the government to help those who are in need in your community . if we all decided to be the change ourselves we could reshape this nation from the ground up .","the fundamental problem with the stance you 're taking is that the only issues that would be attended to would be issues that have enough people with enough capital ( both in the form of actual money and in the form of time ) to make an impact . for example , if you "" fix "" civil rights for gay people on a federal level then it does n't matter if large portions of the country are indifferent . a group of people has their civil rights intact , regardless of whether they live in an area like berkley , california or deer run , kansas . it 's easy to raise money and awareness for a cute endangered animal , it 's very hard to raise money and awarness for ugly animals or creatures that are important but practically invisible in the ecosystem . the beautiful thing about government , when it 's functioning well , is that it attends to the needs of everyone . everyone gets clean water , everyone gets civil rights , etc. etc . this is the same reason that i bristle at the idea that churches should take on the role of social safety net programs and that we do n't need welfare , medicaid , wic , etc . i want there to be a social safety net in place for everyone regardless of their religious affiliation , their sexual orientation , etc. etc . the problem here is many of these issues are directly impacted by the government . it 's quite hard to donate to and help a local abortion clinic if the government outlaws it . although volunteering is admirable , we should still hold the government accountable for things it is failing to do . if people volunteer without drawing attention to the issue , government may not even be aware that there ’s a problem that needs to be addressed . i 'm arguing against your latter point , that volunteering and donations are a suitable replacement to the government fixing issues . there are problems that only the gov can solve , and individuals and donations can not . i mean ... ok there coutries ' governments fix a lot of the problems were looking for ours to fix . there are many problems that the government is just better suited to fix : unemployment or other economic based issues which philanthropy is n't well suited to fix in fact , most of the issues you mentioned are way better done by the government . individuals have very little power over their total environmental impact since most environmental problems come from companies and much of that can be done in secret without proper government intervention . feel good volunteering , such as sandwich assembly charities that could be done significantly cheaper and faster without volunteers or people that fly to disaster areas to help with the cleanup but end up being more of a burden on things like their limited food supply . there is only so much time an individual non-politician can invest in influencing politics ( such as writing your congressmen and voting ) , so why not do all of those things and also donate and volunteer ? there are some problems that we absolutely do not want volunteers to solve instead of the government ."
9udjs6,"the safety of a person that flees from police either on foot or by vehicle should not be take into account when making a risk assessment to continue or abort the pursuit . i think that the safety of a person fleeing from the police , be that on foot , with a car , motorcycle , bike , ... should not be considered during the polices continuous evaluation of the safety of the pursuit . obviously the safety of the police-officers , the public , any potential passengers of the vehicle that is being pursued , ... should all be take into account . but the driver of the vehicle ( or the person running away on foot ) made a conscious choice to flee from the police . so he/she must have weighed the risks associated with fleeing against the risk of being caught . if that person thinks it 's more beneficial for him/her to run , then that should be their responsibility and not the polices . a situation where this might occur is when police are chasing someone that is driving around without a helmet on a moped . as long as it 's safe for the public , the officers and there are no passengers on that moped i think that the police should chase it . a lot of police departments in various countries will however not chase such mopeds in this situation because the crime being committed ( not wearing a helmet ) does n't outweigh the risk to the drivers life . i 'm sure there will be some around the world that do n't consider this . but i think no police department should terminate this pursuit for because the driver put his own life in danger . that 's his choice . now i 'm not saying we have to make laws forcing this . but i do think that gradually policies should be altered .","how do you justify further endangering someones life to issue a simple ticket ? yes they are already not wearing a helmet , but a police chase will absolutely increase the odds of a crash at that point in time . the chase-ie will take risks in order to escape and the chaser will have to take risks to keep up . and if this happens in a populated area the public will also be put at greater risk . like say a 15 year old kid shoplifts some yugioh cards and as he ’s leaving runs into a cop . he ’s 15 , he committed a crime , he ’s scared so he runs . for example , if someone flees as soon as they see the police , and the police have no other basis for suspicion , but pursuit would endanger the life of the flee-er , maybe pursuit us unwanted . ( and if you do not think innocent people have good reason to run from police , have a listen to the recent season of the serial podcast . ) it creates a sort of de facto extra-judicial sentencing , if the penalty for no helmet is a ticket and fine , and the penalty for fleeing is probably a small amount of jail time , but this is increased to death or severe bodily injury via the chase . a person avoiding a light penalty through fleeing , or a person getting the death penalty , without a trial , for a crime that never would come close to such a punishment . that person has also chosen to flee from the police , we probably should n't rely on them making appropriate risk assessments . police have a duty of care towards public - just because a member of public commits a crime ( or more accurately in most cases is suspected of committing a crime ) , or does something stupid does n't mean that duty suddenly ceases . pursue the suspect : best case scenario , police catch the person without harming anyone . worse case scenario , the suspect ends up a smear on the ground and is dead . dont pursue the suspect : best case scenario , police go up to the person at their homes and arrest them there . worse case scenario , the person escapes but has an arrest warrant on their name so whenever they next interact with government entity they are arrested . unless there is genuine , credible threat of serious harm being committed by that person , how does it make sense to potentially kill them just so you can arrest them few weeks or months faster ? strength of police is n't in winning every single battle - it is in having a system that is persistent with backing of state apparatus to perform long term surveillance and operations . this is the motto of many police departments for a reason . low enforcement ’s job is not to arrest people , that ’s just one tool they use to protect and serve the public ... the suspect is still a member of the public , unless the suspect becomes a clear and present threat to other citizens , the public should do their duty to protect everyone . police dont chase people in that situation you gave because they honestly dont want to put their resources into chasing someone down for a little thing like that , when big crimes happen every day that they need to focus on . plus , if you allow this , then suddenly any case of police brutality can now simply be avoided by the officer . typically the rules of a police department are to resolve all situations with the utmost care for the preservation of life . so while if someone who just killed 20 people fled , the life of the suspect is deprioritized because he could be on a killing spree and want to kill 20 more people . but to never ever consider his life in the risk assessment just seems cold blooded ."
9udi9x,"media outlets sharing exit polls hurts democracy . my opinion : media outlets that share poll results , especially exit polls , during any stage of voting ( i.e. early voting or on election night ) hampers democracy . broadcasting exit poll results harms democracy by demoralizing those whose candidates or parties are polling behind , and by incentivizing laziness or inaction in those whose candidates or parties are polling ahead . for both groups , the introduction of this impartial information can have a chilling effect on democracy , and the practice should be more heavily regulated .","so you are saying exit polls reduce votes for both the candidate that is ahead and behind ( i am assuming both demoralizing and laziness result in lower votes ) ? if you said that exit polls hurts one much more than the other i might agree with you . exit polls are not shared until polls close in that state and then they ’re announced . any poll data you ’re seeing is unrelated to exit polling . in the uk is absolutely illegal to skate any exit poll data until the voting is over . absolutely not , exit polls are most important for seeing what groups of people sympathize and endorse a candidate over the other . media outlets have sacrificed any chance on democracy for ratings since their conception , at least in the united states . i ’m pretty sure True exit polls with candidate vote questions do n’t happen until election day when everyone who is going to vote , has done so or has already decided . additionally , if you feel exit polls are harmful , pre-election polling would have the same effect . if a store near the local college offers free tacos all day , did that store hamper kids from voting and thereby is that store an enemy of democracy ? additionally , voting is n't only about the outcome , but also about the magnitude of the outcome . if someone does n't understand that and decides to not vote , that 's not on the people who report exit polling . you 're assuming on their behalf that they 're too stupid to figure out the inaccuracy of exit polling . or that they 're too stupid to understand the importance of a vote even if it is n't ultimately a close race . sure , exit polls can theoretically influence voter turnout , but it can only be an issue when voter turnout is low . your effort would be better spent addressing voter apathy and the fact that voting is still a hassle . everyone should be registered by default and able to vote at any polling station in the country . the effect polling has is negligible in comparison to the effect the 2 ( 1.5 ) party system has would n't it provide proof to the upkeep of democracy or perhaps proof of not having a democracy such as the one party in china to ban it would lead to a chilling effect on free speech . writing a paper on the effect of the media on elections as we speak , the polls do not alter an individual 's willingness to vote . they only measurable change in voters caused by the media is that a voter uses whatever news the hear to strengthen their own political opinions , regardless of what the news is . aditionally , fun fact , the president actually has no power to change public opinions on issues . in my country it is a problem too , media is reporting every few days how much party x or y has fallen according to polls , this is for sure affecting people . in addition to that any sort of campaigning or activity that could influence voters is illegal on election day -- you 're allowed to encourage people to vote , you 're just not allowed to tell them who to vote for . i think it creates a safe environment on election day for voters to go vote unmolested by campaigners and without knowledge of how things are going ( of course , there are usually polls the day before ) . the chilling effect is troubling , but that would tend to occur when an election appears to be one sided . part of the purpose of exit polls is as a safeguard against tampering with election results . if you go into the polls , vote for candidate a , and only talk with your family and friends about who they voted for , then it might not seem weird if they announce candidate b won in a landslide . however , if 80 % of people in exit polls report voting for candidate a , then a landslide victory of candidate b looks a whole lot fishier . i 'd be willing to bring up that even if this is the case , it does n't hurt democracy as much as a lot of other things that are keeping people from voting more directly by making it more difficult . polling and sharing polls seems like it would be protected by the 1st amendment . i think what is far more hampering to our democracy is how the government makes no laws to actually increase the vote by making it easier in fact it tends to be the opposite with things like the voter id law . i agree to a point , but if a poll is going to deter someone from voting then maybe they did n't have the conviction in the first place . so fewer people on both sides vote , but the results are unchanged ( since it is only chilling when it is clear who is going to win ) . it can have a chilling effect on the number of total votes , but that is n't synonymous with democracy . the media is free to influence elections and the democratic process in many ways , including via broadcasting exit polling . sup , french guy here : our election day is always on a sunday and from friday on , no political messages can be published by any party or candidate and no polls are allowed to be made . results are published roughly an hour after closure of the voting booths at 8pm , and by then roughly 70-80 % of the votes have been counted . cmv : people who would be influenced by this probably should n't vote . the point of those types of ads is not necessarily to convince people from one side of the aisle to switch but rather to encourage them not to vote for their opponent . this is the same effect as what exit polling is doing but less objective . we do n't have this problem in my country because we 've had compulsory voting ( $ 50 fine if you do n't ) fir about a century and 95 % voter turn out for a century too . exit polls are also very unreliable due to our preferential voting system . i may be wrong but i think most media outlets , the major ones at least , hold exit results until after the poles have closed.i remember there were some mistakes like when a state spans two timezones . in canada media can not report anything on the day of election until all the polls are closed . in britain it 's illegal to show anything that could effect the way people vote on the day of the election until polls close . a great example of this was back in the last general election when a show called "" the last leg "" ( so called because it 's hosted by a guy with one leg ) wanted to have some piglets dressed in different colours to represent the different parties race eachother as a "" prediction "" for the results . did n't want to change your view , but i just thought i could contribute . in the uk exit polls can not be released until after voting has closed . also for me its strange that ( in presidential elections ) you allow counting to begin when some states are still voting . i 'm assuming that this is us based , as in the uk exit polls are only published once polling is closed . frankly i agree with the fact that publishing exit polls on the east coast once voting is closed there may influence voting that is still going on on the west coast , in the same vein of announcing in the media the way a jury is likely to vote may influence the decisions of the jury themselves . in the 2015 uk general election most polls before the election were very consistent with each other , and once the exit polls were published they were markedly different from every other poll beforehand , but were the closest to the actual result . therefore i agree with the part of your view that releasing any exit polls before voting has finished , i.e a presidential election , is wrong . however , releasing the polling statistics of individual constituencies or states , when voting for congressional or senate seats , will have no effect . anywhere where polling closes all at once ( such as countries in a single time zone ) once no one can vote can not influence the vote , therefore will not hurt democracy . exit polls provide assurance that elections results are valid though . if there is a discrepancy between exit polls and the election results , it calls the legitimacy of the election into question . lol no , the only people it demoralizes into being too lazy to vote are neoliberal lefties and good riddance to them tbh the respondent said that politicians pay for these polls constantly , for elections and policy decisions . i believe india banned exit polls until all the regions are done when elections ! i think a better solution would be more advertising or media attention on the non-national races . my ballots are regularly front-and-back printed pages , but the media tends to focus on congress , president , and governor . i think if media made it more clear that those are n't the only things on the ballot , people might be more inclined to vote - both generally and no matter what exit polls showed about the top-ballot stuff . in the uk , it is illegal to release any information about exit polls until 10 pm when everyone has finished voting due to canada having many time zones , and wanting to prevent west coasters from being influenced by the east , we have a blackout of not just exit polling , but on the reporting of the results themselves until after all polls had closed . because with the advent of the internet , people who simply go on social media like twitter and announce the results anyway . live exit polls can also be a method of identifying voter fraud quickly , if 90 % anerwring the exit poll say they voted a then if b is elected there is immediate justification for recount ... let 's suppose - for the sake of argument - that these people releasing polls do have an impact on the outcomes of elections . if you think media outlets that publish polls are bad , consider what political parties regularly do as part of the election cycle . the mass media outlets are businesses driven by a profit incentive . if they 're "" preserving the institutions of democracy "" that 's , at best , a happy accident . but if you 're worried about the media hurting democracy , then it 's really odd to see you picking on one tiny thing that happens infrequently , when partisan outlets are constantly beating their drums , and the neutral ones tend to be more interested in drama and sensation than in substance . any private party can peaceably assemble with any other private party to discuss political matters and report the results as they see fit . any government interference in this activity should be very carefully scrutinized , as it could quickly escalate to an incumbent government using this power to control the messages allowed to reach the general public . ( 2 ) any independent effort that sheds light on how people are actually voting is an almost unalloyed good , imo . exit polls that conflict with the official story put the incumbent government on notice that their activities are not meeting independent verification . an on presidental election day poll results from each state should be kept hidden until all the states are done voting . so that means the east cost states ca n't reveal their results until polls in hawaii close . kinda pointless to vote in hawaii when the rest of the country has already voted and you know who the winner is before the polls even close the worst time of the year is when politicians be playing their ads ."
9ucmr2,"solving europe 's ageing problem with a new migrant baby-boom is a bad idea . many politicians in western-europe argue that in order to save our pension system ( or other welfare programs ) we need more migrants . system in belgium : you pay taxes so the person who is retired right now can get that money . when you retire , there will have to be someone else paying taxes for you to recieve a pension . this repeats ad infinitum . i would rather see a durable system which is n't dependent on eternal population growth . and politicians right now are choosing the easy solution by just importing new tax payers instead of changing a flawed system . in other words and to make sure i hit that 500 character mark , solving the consequences of a baby-boom with a new baby-boom seems utterly stupid .","firstly , calling the general idea a baby boom i would n't agree with . a baby boom is generally thought of as a period of sharply increasing birth rates , leading to a fast increase in population but i would say that the idea is n't so much to emulate a baby boom , but rather to substitute the declining population with immigration to keep population increasing at a stable rate . also , i would n't agree that this solution is "" the easy solution "" for politicians to propose . i agree with you that it is n't a perfect solution but when you take into account the advantages of this approach of supplying low-skill workers , a more stable economy , and a younger population average ( and therefore a smaller proportion of pensioners ) , there is just no known alternative approach which yields these advantages with as few disadvantages as immigration has . although a perfect example of an aging population with very restrictive immigration laws is japan which is currently in a strong economic position but only time will tell whether or not this will last , personally i absolutely do n't think it will . this is a very hard cmv , since all your saying is that this plan is flawed but not giving us your solution to the problem . with out alternatives its hard to criticise this current solution since it is the best plan we have . population replacement with migrants will only ever be a part of any population growth strategy . i get that those are not easy to answer questions , but without a good answer you and a majority of your peers can agree on then "" we should have a better system "" is n't really an option and you 're stuck with what you have now , with a lack of new people to sustain it . it 's quite possible that its easier to fix the "" not enough new people "" problem than it is to solve the "" we should have a sustainable system "" problem ."
9ubq8v,"law is form of aggregated morals and values last week there was another cmv discussion where reddit user maytown stated that “ the law is n't there to legislate morality . ” and i stated that that is exactly what law is . . there was a small discussion on this topic but i really want to continue this discussion and hear other opinions . & #x200b ; first thing you have to know is that i ’m solid moral relativist meaning that i do n’t believe that there is any fundamental or universal moral guide lines that are \ ” written in universes source code ” \ . you ca n’t find moral truth by studying physics or biology . every person have to find their own values and morals they want to live by and thrive to be best human they can be ( according to themselves ) . this view is not open for discussion today because it ’s a whole other can of worms . today i want to discuss about laws and legislation . & #x200b ; my solid view is that law is form of aggregated morals and values . everyone has some moral values and each person have little bit different values . but we share lot of values with each other and more so fi we share the same culture . when electing leaders/politics/legislators we pick people that share our moral values . then these people write laws that share their moral values . in this process individual moral values are summed and averaged multiple times and distilled in form of law . therefore , i can say that killing someone is illegal because it is morally wrong . & #x200b ; for one example lets pick killing someone . most people agree that killing other human being is morally wrong but there are examples where other values or rights are greater than value of human life . for example , some people say that property rights are more important allowing people to carry weapons and shoot trespassers . we also allow capital punishment and in some countries euthanasia . in these examples law makers weigh their voters moral values ( property , punishment , dignity vs human life ) and write laws accordingly . in other countries voters/citizen share different moral values as whole allowing different laws to be implemented . & #x200b ; there are some cave-ins in democratic system where law makers might not consider citizens moral values as whole as much as for example powerful and wealthy interest groups moral values . but even in these cases i see that laws becomes aggreged morals of the powerful . i find this discussion to be important because political discussion should really be discussion about values instead of issues and statements like “ keep your moral views away from politics ” is inherently False . i ca n’t really think what would change my view but i try to keep leveled head and listen to other opinions . you never know what you might learn .","if person a believes it 's morally wrong to kill an intruder and person b disagrees , a will believe that society would function better if it was illegal to kill the intruder and b would believe the inverse etc . there 's also the issue of personal freedom , if someone thinks it 's immoral to eat pork that does n't mean i should be forced to not eat it either . but i do n't think the law should value freedom because it 's moral , i just think that 's genuinely the best way to keep society working with everyone as happy as possible . everybody would agree that it 's immoral to cheat on your so but there 's not a big movement to make that illegal . people 's opinion on what "" running smoothly "" means and how best to achieve that can come down to personal morals/beliefs/religion , but i do n't believe it 's correct to say that legislating morality is the primary goal of the law . when you say you 're a moral relativist , does that mean that literally nothing can be defined as immoral so long as one person benefits from it ? for instance , if we 're both standing in line for coffee , and i shoot you in the back of the head so i can get to work two minutes faster , can i call that action moral if my morality is that my interests come above all ? while the law might be a floor , there is an issue when you think that the freedom to swing your fists ends where my nose begins . the main pillars of law is the formalized , codified version of the most basic foundations of public morality . if it so happens that moral claims align with that which keeps order and maintains power , then laws would reflect a moral standard in society . however , notice how there are always people who are allowed to enforce the law , thereby breaking the moral standard they are meant to enforce . law can ultimately be described as an attempt to simplify morality to a mathematical form that can be judged and enforced with objectivity . it 's interesting that you linked to a discussion about the legislation of cheating . although cheating is overwhelmingly against the morality and values of society , we do not legislate against it , at least not anymore . secondly , a lot of laws are not based on morals and values at all . i 'm not saying that morals and values ca n't be the motivation for passing certain laws , but your view seems to be a lot more absolute/categorical , especially when you say : "" that is exactly that law is there for "" . there 's a clear-cut difference between this kind of law where they recognize that different countries are going to have different rules and you just follow whatever the rules are wherever you are , and a morally-repugnant law , such as those upholding slave-like ownership of women in yemen . no , laws against cheating were seen to cause more harm than good - but adultery was still considered extremely immoral . no - it 's a stupid law because it does n't work . furthermore , consider the many situations where people do clearly uphold a moral principle distinct from the law . so if i take "" your "" marijuana without paying i 'm breaking fewer laws than if i buy it from you ."
9u9nge,"melbourne cup day in australia should be replaced with a different holiday . in australia , specifically in the state of victoria , on the first tuesday in november there 's a public holiday for melbourne cup day , which is in celebration of a horse race . i have no problems with public holidays in general , however i feel they should focus around something more worthy than celebrating a horse race . horse racing is cruel to animals . many horses are killed through injuries during races , and when their life value as a racing animal is expired the horses are killed . to get them to run , the horses are whipped heavily , and are force to carry a person along with them . this is all done purely for entertainment , it 's not like they 're providing a food source to keep people alive . it 's just needless cruelty . horse racing is all about gambling . gambling at it 's core is random amounts of money changing hands , but overall the bookies winning . the bookies create no actual value , they just literally swap some money around and keep some for themselves . gambling is a big psychological problem in many people , it can be addictive and wreck people and their families . by it 's nature it 's compulsive and impulsive and has very little benefit to society . there 's also a big culture of alcohol abuse around the event as well , the idea being you take a day off work , get intoxicated , and spend your money on gambling . now i can accept that people will still want to gamble , drink , and race horses , but i do n't think this should be institutionally celebrated by having a public holiday all about it . while this is a tradition , that 's no need to keep it going when really the whole event is about exploitation and cruelty to animals , and promoting gambling . it 's overall a net negative on society . maybe a different holiday would take it 's place ?","the melbourne cup is a very big part of victorian , or at least melbourne 's , culture ."
9u9e8i,"voter id law is a good thing . context : north carolina is going through a public referendum whether to require a photo id at voting booths . i have heard many folks claiming that this law ( or any other law that is similar ) is discriminatory and unfair towards minority groups . although i do not believe voter fraud is a huge issue in the us , i do n't see why voter id laws are inherently discriminatory . i think it is a good thing that we check whether the person who is voting is a real person who she/he claims to be . if a voter id requirement hurts and disenfranchises certain groups of people , i 'd say the solution is to make an effort to get everyone a photo id rather than preventing these sorts of laws from passing .","in alabama , between 250,000 and 500,000 voters would be affected by the photo id laws and the 2014 alabama gubernatorial race , for example , only had a margin of victory of 320,000 votes . it would be one thing if these laws were paired with laws to make it easier for people to obtain state ids . it does n't prevent vote buying , vote tampering , or ballot box stuffing , it only prevents the crime of a single person waiting in line to vote and casting a single vote pretending to be someone they are not and comes with a punishment of 5 years in prison and $ 10,000 fine if caught . one concern that keeps getting brought up is dead voters , and a study was done in south carolina found that 953 dead people casting votes , but when a follow-up investigation was done , they ended up finding most of them were False positives that only appeared like dead voters like people who have the same name as their dead parent or people who absentee voted and died before the actual election . compare 5 cases of dead people voting to 500,000 to 600,000 registered voters without valid id . and those people who lack valid id are disproportionately minorities . black people are 2x as likely to lack valid id and latinos are 2.5 x as likely to lack valid id . and , given that the republican party is not really hiding the fact that they do n't really want minority groups to vote , this probably means these laws were designed to disproportionately affect minority groups . which would make this specific instance of a voter id law unconstitutional , by definition . why would we expect implementation of voter id to be equitable when the people in charge of that implementation have shown that they are willing to discriminate based on race for political gain ? saying "" voter id law is a good thing "" is impossible to argue , kinda like saying "" gun control is good "" , because it 's so incredibly loosely defined . here are the things about nc 's referendum in particular : the referendum is extremely vague ( giving nc power to start demanding voter id , while not having any sort of plan set to supply that voter id or indeed even defining what counts as voter id and what does n't ) and it 's already been tried once and struck down in court . in 2013 , nc passed an omnibus bill that , among other things , included a demand for photo id and lowered the amount of early-voting days . in 2016 , the us court of appeals struck it down , finding that not only the bill was playing up a problem that was by any metric minor ( fake votes ) but that the bill 's solution to the problem was clearly built to disenfranchise certain voting blocks ( poor people , black people ) . one of the main arguments by the coa judges , which can be found in the transcript , is that the state 's legislature literally requested racially and financially-divided data on the usage of voting methods and availability of id , and the changes they made line up with that data . for example , black people vote early and poor people are more likely to have a public assistance id ( which does have their photo on it , meaning it is a photo id ) . so the state legislature cut a bunch of those early voting days and explictly did n't include public assistance ids in the list of their acceptable photo ids ( which included veterans ' ids , driving licenses , military id and passports ) . it 's a landmark case of legislation being proposed as common-sense and necessary while being outlined as a way to disenfranchise certain types of legal voters . it is much harder for someone with the "" poor "" profile to get an id than a person with a "" wealthy "" profile to get an idea . all told , i could have my new id in hand as fast as the government agency in charge of issuing it could issue it . i 'll have to figure out which agency even has a copy of my birth records and try to get them . both versions of me were both born u.s. citizens , we both live in the same city , but our life circumstances make it easy and not so easy to fulfill basic id requirements . i agree 100 % with you that there should be a push towards getting everyone a photo id . ironically , the very laws you suggest are always pushed back against by the very political groups that are doing all the disenfranchising . it 's almost like the voter id laws and the resistance to making it easy to get an id are by design . north carolina 's last voter id laws were overturned by its court because the state representatives were found to be using the laws to block black voters . i think you 'll find that the groups and individuals proposing voter id laws are generally against programs to provide universal ids to all citizens . opponents of voter id laws are very much for all of those things . in theory , in a vacuum , voter id laws are fine . in reality they are not in any way needed , and are actively being used to disenfranchise citizens and rig elections . “ although i do not believe voter fraud is a huge issue in the us , ” correct me if i ’m wrong but you ’re saying that even though voter fraud is n’t a huge issue in this country , we should have voter id laws in place to prevent voter fraud . if the law , as they had it written , was indeed a good thing then it would ’ve passed easily or at the very least not been ruled unconstitutional by a judge . there will be a few whites who get caught up in the voter suppression efforts , but the main victims will be minorities . low-income people tend to work in jobs that do n't require photo id at all ( unlike white-collar jobs that use id for verification during the hiring process ) , and also not own cars , which is why there are so many of them who lack the cards to begin with . finally some states like georgia use draconian "" exact match "" requirements for the photo id . they can literally turn voters away just because the registered name has a hyphen or accent and the photo id is missing the hyphen/accent but is otherwise correct . as you can see , the government does n't explicitly say "" black people can not vote "" but they know about certain trends that disproportionately affect blacks and other minorities , and tailor voter suppression efforts around those trends . if everyone had a fair and equal chance of obtaining a photo id , then the voter id laws would n't attract the negative attention that they currently do ."
9u8jmh,"i 'm not obligated to tip anyone context : i 'll be speaking about the us here . i would tip someone is to thank them for going above-and-beyond , or if i 'm just feeling generous . but otherwise i would n't . if you listened to reddit , you would think this makes me a bad person . but it does n't , and here 's why : 1 . "" but if you do n't tip , employees will earn less than minimum wage ! "" 1 . look at this chart from the department of labor . you can see most states are either purple or green - this means that even if nobody tipped , tipped employees would still necessarily earn the state minimum wage . the blue states mean that if nobody tipped , tipped employees would earn the federal minimum wage . it is True that in most states employers can pay their tipped employees below the minimum wage , but only if their tips add up to being minimum wage or more . there is no legal situation in the us where a tipped employee earns less than the federal minimum wage . note that many of the blue states on that graph are only blue because the state does n't have a minimum wage . 2 . "" but employers could illegally pay their employees less than minimum wage ! "" 1 . this is the case for any job . and you might think that employers of tipped employees are more likely to break the law , but if you really think there 's a good chance that an establishment is ignoring very important state and federal laws , then morally and practically i 'd say you should not encourage that behavior by patronizing them at all , let alone tipping their employees 3 . "" but waiters and other tipped employees deserve that extra money ! "" 1 . why ? nobody tips the busboy who helps clean up your table , or the dishwasher who cleans your plates . 2 . i worked as a waiter for over a year , but i was in a nursing home . federal regulations say that employees of a nursing home are not allowed to directly receive any compensation from the residents - this means i was working as a waiter , for minimum wage , for over a year , and never received a cent in tips . and now i 'm expected to go tip waiters unconditionally ? nothing waiters do is that special that they deserve special treatment in the form of tips 3 . i guarantee there are people who need or deserve your extra dollars much more than waiters . do you also give money to every homeless person you see ? do you donate to deworm the world ? they both need it much more than some waiter is likely to 4 . "" but if you do n't tip , your friends will think you 're a scrooge ! "" 1 . i do n't have any friends given all these reasons , i see no compelling reason to tip . please , change my view .","actually , i tip out the bussers , the food runners and the bartenders . i do n't tip the dishwasher or the cooks because they make an hourly wage . i work 30 to 40 hours a week and my checks are never over $ 100 because the irs assumes i make a certain amount per hour via tips ( tip compliance ) . just let your server know as soon as they greet you that you will not be tipping . usually the tips get shared among waiters and bus boys and kitchen staff , so it ’s not just going to the waiter . you ’re not really obligated to tip , but usually it ’s a good way to reward waiters and encourage good service . but if you regularly patronize a place and you become known as someone who does n’t tip , they will most likely not be as interested in providing top service for you . if you feel you should n't tip , do you let the wait staff know that up front ? i mean they will prioritize the service they give you assuming you will tip . in the usa , i understand that without tips , a waiter still gets minimum wage . the minimum wage should be raised to 15 dollars per hour . in belgium , we do n't have your broken system of tipping underpaid people . however , i also understand that the system is currently broken . and when i 'm treating myself , i would feel bad when i 'm exploiting someone , when the person who 's treating me is paid less than a living wage . i 've been in the usa several times and i 've always felt a moral obligation to tip . i tip well because i believe hte waiter deserves to be paid well and if the system allows them to be underpaid , it 's my obligation to make up for it , while also advocating for a better , belgium-style , system . the fact that you do n't have such moral compunction explains the answer to question 4 . if you do n't want a moral obligation to tip , fight for a decent minimum wage . on 3a specifically , it is quite common for wait staff to give some of their tips to busboys to make them more likely to clear their tables first . green is specifically for states that require employees to be paid above the federal minimum wage , but does not require them to be paid the state minimum . scrolling down the chart , you see things like e.g. arkansas , where the minimum pay for tipped employees is $ 2.63 , barely above the federal minimum for tipped employees of $ 2.13 an hour . further , this argument only really holds if you 're actually living in one of the states where employees are required to be paid minimum wage ; "" well , most states require it "" is n't really applicable if you 're in one of the states that does n't , or in one of the states with a paltry increase above the federal minimum for tipped employees . also , a state being blue because it does n't have a minimum wage still means that employees are making $ 2.13 an hour before tips versus a federal minimum significantly above that . finally. , even if these employees are making minimum wage , their income expectations are still heavily tied to tipping and poor tipping is likely to harm them . imagine if you worked in a customer facing salaried job and made $ 50k a year , but customer complaints could halve your pay for a given period . the practical reality of cash based tipped positions is that you 're more likely to incidentally or maliciously be screwed out of minimum wage than in other positions . it is much easier for an employee , tipped in cash , to not properly account for whether they are making minimum wage for a given period than it is for a salaried employee or somebody paid via check . further , low-paying positions like waiters typically do not have significant resources , making it difficult to go after lost pay without risking their job . as far as the latter argument , whether or not you should eat at restaurants is irrelevant to whether you should tip if you do , but there are two points here . the first is that people saying "" well , the management would probably fail to pay them without tips "" are not saying that specific restaurants would do that , but that there 's a high probability restaurants in general would do that . it is n't possible to avoid specific establishments like that , which leads to my second point : there really is n't ethical consumption in capitalism . it 's impossible to avoid patronizing businesses that engage in unethical , immoral , or even illegal practices , and this sort of "" gotcha "" argument always reminds me of this panel ; people can be critical or even cynical about how businesses work without ... i du n no , foraging for their own food to avoid supporting anything they criticize ? "" waiters deserve the money "" is not a particularly compelling argument , i agree , but the basic point behind it is what i said above ; waiters have pay expectations that are more or less entirely based on how many tips they receive , and breaking that social contract is rude in a way that directly harms employees . and whether people are hypocritical about giving up their money or whatever does n't actually impact whether tipping is something you should do ; you could be totally right that the people talking about tipping should donate more to charity and help feed the homeless , and those people would still be right that tipping is an expectation . ( also busboys tend to get tipped out by the waiters so they do actually have an expectation of pay based on tips , but that 's not universal ) . tipping is a bad system that leads to a lot of negative outcomes , and offers a convenient , if selfish , way for certain people to save money on their food . however , it 's still the system in place , and it 's still directly impacting other people 's pay , in a way that 's contrary to social expectations , to avoid tipping , and not tipping will have basically no impact on the system as a whole while potentially having a large impact on the individual staff member ( especially as your food bill gets higher and the individual attention paid to you increases ) . i feel that you are arbitrarily choosing minimum wage as the “ accepted ” wage for waiters . that as long as they are getting paid minimum wage , that is fine . as econ 101 explains , wages are determined by the supply and demand for labor . when a waiter takes a job , they expect to be paid above minimum wage , usually . importantly , i took the job because i expected to make more than minimum wage . and while i would prefer that the restaurant paid me that way , the industry is set up so that the customer instead is the one that pays me that wage . if everyone did n’t tip , waiters would only get paid minimum wage but this is usually below their economically determined wage . the way the institution is set up ( and you personally ca n’t change that institution ) , you are responsible for paying them that wage . food is served slightly below market price because of tipping . restaurants charge $ 10 for an $ 11-12 dish because they expect tips to make up the additional wages they need to pay to employees . in restaurants without tipping , prices are slightly higher to accommodate it ."
9u7u7x,"all cops in the usa should be required to have a bachelors degree to get the job there are hundreds of videos ( if not thousands ) of cops making horrible mistakes , not knowing the law , and even escalating situations that could have been solved in a better way . why do doctors need degrees to help save lives , but still many police stations do n’t require any college education for someone who could potentially take a life ? a lawyer spends years learning the law , but someone can enforce the law relatively much easier . it just does n’t make any sense to me . knowing the law better and getting more years of special training would make it harder for people incapable of handling situations be riding around with guns . if anyone has some insight on analytics that concludes it does n’t matter what level of education they have , i ’ll gladly consider changing my mind . maybe some insight from law enforcement themselves may help me change my mind too , but i just ca n’t seem to understand the rationale of only having a policy academy that ’s sub par at training compared to what a high end university could at best .","for the police , this is completely irrelevant , because there 's only one police force , so it 's much easier , better and more effective for them to have their own training program , that they tailor to the needs of every specific role a cop may have . what data are you drawing from in suggesting that enough cops have made mistakes that they need to have a bachelor 's degree ? i ’ve know plenty of stupid people with bachelors degrees . most police officers actually have bachelors degrees and are very intelligent people . there are very few officers who are stupid , however the media just makes it seem like it ’s more common because they report on it every single time there ’s an incident . if you make more requirements then it ’ll be harder to hire new recruits . while they usually aim to hire people with bachelors degrees , they need to be able to hire other people if they ’re understaffed . i ’d rather have somebody with a high school education and academy training come to my aid than nobody at all . a college degree would do next to nothing to help police do their jobs better . people who have college degrees and become police make mistakes as well . a college degree is n’t a magic spell , and being a policeman means you ’re theoretically trained in what you need to know at the academy . a college education is not relevant to the daily tasks associated with being a police officer . the problems you associate with the way some cops do their jobs are better addressed through practical training , not academic instruction . an academic understanding of the law is relevant to the job of being a lawyer . it is not relevant to the job of being a police officer . first of all , i dare say that degrees are not required now because the demand of police officers would be much higher than the supply of certified candidates . an educated police force is no good if it is undermanned . i dare say all the politicians you hate the most have university degrees . a doctor out of medical school is nowhere near qualified to work as a chief surgeon . a lawyer out of law school is not qualified for the supreme court . if you really want to improve law enforcement , you have to train the officers on the job . but i know of areas in other states that have extremely severe police shortages to the point of which calling 911 without having someone whose life is in immediate danger may result in waiting several days . you act like cops need to be trained lawyers or that a college education would help them know to not fire a gun at someone who is unarmed . cops do need to know laws as far as it pertains to their jobs such as reasonable searches , reasonable suspicion , reading miranda rights , proper chain of custody for evidence , when they can use what level of weapons , etc , but that is all stuff that is learned in training and would n't be covered by a college degree in biology anyway . and none of what a cop really does requires much knowledge of the specific laws being broken . then it occurred to me one day that all it will do is devalue the worth of a bachelors degree . police are a machine for making money , so if they had a new hurdle , the city and the government will do everything they can to make that hurdle as low as possible . until one day the bachelors degree has no value because all the same people will still be police . how do you figure that a degree will make you a less violent enforcer of the law . the police is doing the job it was intended for : enforcing the law . if you want a less violent police force eliminate the guns . or maybe another way to eliminate violence is to eliminate as many law as possible so police would not have to enforce them and encounter as many people with the potential of someone dying . a school degree of any type will not improve policing , because it is not about intellect but fear . a degree will not stop a bullet from leaving an officer 's gun or a bullet from entering an officer . no amount of knowing the law is going to stop police encounters and the potential shooting of another citizen . you ca n't learn human interactions in a classroom , especially the varying types of personalities that police encounter ."
9u7612,"structuring income to get below a cutoff for government benefits is no different than contributing to a 401k or any other legal method to reduce owed taxes . this was prompted by a recent / r/financialindependence thread wherein the op was discussing intentionally structuring their agi in order to take advantage of reduced cost healthcare available to people with low agi through the healthcare.gov marketplace . essentially , the plan was to decrease their take-home pay as much as possible through methods like 401k/ira withholding , with the end result being that their take-home pay is little enough to qualify for some extra subsidies . while the majority of people in the subreddit were supportive , there were a fair amount of people who felt that this strategy was unethical because only those with low assets ( not just low income ) "" need "" subsidies . i was a little surprised at this backlash because in my mind , this strategy is no different than reducing your taxable income by putting money in a retirement account , or deductions for things like charity or mortgage interest . the bottom line for government benefits is that they all eventually come down to a monetary cost/value for the government . is it different to reduce your income to save on taxes versus reducing your income to ... save on other government fees like healthcare premiums ? it just seems like a logical inconsistency to me , couched in the fact that in one case you use the word "" tax "" and in the other case you use the word "" premium "" . the supposition seems to be that it 's wrong and/or unethical to not pay the maximum taxes you can , but that logic does n't seem to hold when applied to other programs . that same logic can also be drawn out well into the absurd - ie , why not just donate all the money you can to the government , even if you do n't legally owe it . so where 's the line ? i do acknowledge that the laws governing who is eligible for benefits are not perfect , and i 'm not necessarily against altering them . however , "" the laws are bad and should be changed "" seems a bit like a strawman in regards to whether you should be working within them as-is . as it stands , many benefits are based on agi ( something fairly easy to manipulate ) , and not something like total assets . however , if it makes sense to asset test these benefits ( for example , not allowing people with substantial assets to use aca subsidies ) , then does n't it make sense to also prevent those with substantial assets from getting other tax breaks ? for instance , not allowing someone with "" too much "" money in the bank to benefit from charity write-offs ? that seems like a slippery slope , but one i 'm open to exploring . tl ; dr - i think it 's fine to get discounted healthcare if you have ten million dollars in the bank but only pull out $ 30k/yr , because the aca as written is n't for the poor , it 's for those with low taxable income ( not the same thing ) .","yes , because the government receives a benefit from having you save for retirement - you 're less likely to need benefits when you 're older . but they do n't benefit from subsidizing your healthcare if you would have had insurance anyway ( can afford ) . now in this case i think it might balance out -- but if you were dodging it in some other mechanism it might not . for example , you 'll have a lien put on your estate for taking medicaid benefits , which is how benefits are given through the healthcare subsidies ( at least in my state ) . is the access to government benefits a hard cutoff at some threshold , or does it phase out as your takehome pay increases ? this is simply the difference between the letter and the spirit of the law . while it may be True such activities are supported by the letter of the law and perfectly legal , it does not follow that the action is therefore ethical or moral . the law is not morality , and i think this is a good example of where the two do n’t line up . for other tax details , , the law and people ’s ethics line up much more closely , so there is n’t the issue there . i can certainly see how people would have an ethical issue with this action , as it appears to violate the spirit of the law , if not the letter . i think it really depends on what is being done to get the agi low . ethically and philosophically , it would be similar to why we look down on welfare fraud - i do n't know if the person is committing fraud but maybe the person is getting something they should not have ( can he not afford health care or does he just want some more beer money ? )"
9u4l9w,"free market capitalism in america is a lie ; we do n't pay less when there 's more competition . the us is arguably the birthplace of free market capitalism , yet the free market in the us means americans actually pay more for many goods and services compared to other countries . some examples : i pay $ 144 for a cell phone plan that covers 2 phones . in ireland , you can get a cell plan with unlimited data for about $ 35 usd . healthcare costs in the us are higher than in pretty much any other country on the planet . prescription drugs cost about 3x as much in the us than in the uk . the cost of higher education . the us has more universities per capita than any other country and costs are also the greatest compared to a degree in any other country . americans have been sold a bill of goods about free markets . more often than not , corporations find a way to dupe the american consumer so that we pay more while the corporation brings in more profit .","here are billions of dollars in energy subsidies , aka when politicians are saying social services need to be cut , they are speaking out both sides of their mouths because they know most people do n't look at what companies are getting free handouts from subsidies . protectionism for the rich and big business by state intervention , radical market interference . our brains are much worse at reality and thinking than thought . nothing about healthcare in the united states is free market . your other plan probably has the cost of your phones built into it . that 's a very complex issue , but let 's just say for example those high costs help pay for emergency room losses . our medical malpractice insurance is also insanely high , so doctors have to charge a lot just to cover that . we 'd pay a lot less if all countries paid fair market value . cell phones actually have a disturbingly high tax associated with them known as a wireless tax . your bill keeps going up because the governments have been raising it to compensate for revenue lost in other areas . healthcare costs are high because we have the worst system possible for healthcare . out current system is too regulated to let the market assign pricing , while simultaneously not having its price set by a regulatory agency . it actually helps drive people into the mostly deregulated market based healthcare system ( the wedge , and direct primary care ) allowing it to become even better than it already is . prescription drugs are a : expensive to research and the company needs to recoup those costs to remain profitable and b : protected by the patent system enforcing a monopoly on the drug . in other words , prices are high because the patent and copyright system in this country allows unscrupulous companies to abuse the artificial monopolies they create . education costs are high for many reasons , and pretty much all of them can be linked to outside interference . from the guaranteed loans giving essentially free money to institutions regardless of actually quality of service , to the education system pushing everyone to go to college rather than explore other post highschool options , to the crazy amount of regulation involved in actually starting a new school . all of those are examples where there is no free market competition . there are only 4 major carriers , and in most parts of the country , only 1 or 2 have any decent service in a given area . hospitals and health plans have monopolies or oligopolies in almost every market in the us . in a given state , there might be a handful of health plans , if not a single one . furthermore , newer drugs ( generally the better ones ) are protected under patents so only one company can sell them . higher education is heavily subsidized by the government . this can mean the us taxpayer directly gives grants to private colleges or outright pays for public colleges , or it can mean the low interest loans the us government gives to students , which in effect allow universities to raise prices . all of them are situations where people feel that the free market is no adequate and we should try to subsidize the products . people consider communication and access to the internet a human right , therefore they protect/subsidized cell phone carriers , which pushes up prices . when push comes to shove , people are willing to spend a lot of money to keep their friends/family from dying . people think that education is the most important thing in society and are willing to throw money at it , even if it 's past the point of cost effectiveness . i think if you can spend $ 20 and get 80 % of the benefits , i 'd still rather spent the other $ 80 to get to 99 % of the benefits . but i do n't think it 's fair to blame free market capitalism for this problem when i 'm purposefully disrupting it . it 's not free market anymore when i put my thumb on the scale . as others have stated : you provided exactly 0 examples of a free market product . you want it high quality goods , it is going to be expensive . for medicine , education and even cell phone plans there are lower cost options available to you . yes , when you aggregate the offerings and look at the statistical cost spent on them , you do see that americans can pay more for some things on average , but that 's not because of a lack of low cost options . it 's due to people from the first world generally wanting the highest or near-highest quality goods . there are low cost cell plans and universities in the us , and the fact that they 're cheaper is touted as a major competitive advantage . the closest to free market , but still heavily regulated , would be cell plans . my share of a family plan is $ 35/month for 20 gb . i 'd imagine boost mobile is similar . they are the "" discount brands "" for the more major carriers t-mobile and sprint . the more premium brands upsell with offers of free subscriptions to video streaming services . at&t owns directtv now and will try to sell you video services along with the phone . t-mobile partners with netflix and sprint offers both hulu and amazon prime for the more premium lines . the major difference between premium lines and regular "" unlimited "" is the amount of high-speed data access you get . but you should definitely be able to get a $ 40 - $ 45 unlimited basic plan . combining lines usually means you can get the premium benefits at discount prices . cell phones though are one area you need to due your duty as a consumer and actually pay attention . competition only works to bring down prices if customers actually look at more than one price ( i.e. shop-around ) . companies buy thousands of them and then need to off load them when the corporate budget decides they get new ones . it basically is that way here , some corporate desk jockey tries to offload these things as quickly and easily as possible while getting some money , except there are people who specialize in catching these deals falling out of lazy corporate bureaucrats because they can make a living doing it . in the us very few institutions of higher education are corporations , they 're almost all government owned schools or non-profits . ireland has far more cell phone carriers available than the us . there is some argument that emergency healthcare will always cause a market failure because people 's will to live is infinite . however , we do not have a free market nor competition in maintenance health care . when was the last time you walked into a clinic , asked to see their menu of prices , and decided based on your price comparisons and reviews . because we do n't subsidize college as much as other countries . compare elite , private universities to each other and you will find that the price of tuition is pretty tightly bound to the perceived value of the institution and the likelihood that a degree from there will boost your lifetime earnings . no , more often than not we think we have free markets but we do n't . i have a simple reply : there is no free market in america . would it change your view if i said the us is far from a free market economy , it ’s actually one of the most regulated . adam smith even talks about how free markets lead to monopolies which is the basis for anti-trust laws . america is full of intellectual property laws which are n't necessarily "" free market "" . also , under perfect competition it does n't mean prices will be cheaper than under a different system . it means prices will be more efficient but not necessarily cheaper . in communism , everything is free but that does n't mean your quality of life is better because everything being free could be inefficient . even sf and nyc are cheaper than what you 'd pay in 20 other countries . the us is not expensive compared to norway , sweden , denmark , switzerland , germany , france , japan , and many other countries . there are 150 countries in the world where your cellphone would be more expensive . you ca n't just open a hospital and you ca n't just open a university ( for the latter not if you want the degree to be worth more than damp toilet paper ) . people measure how free markets are overall in different countries . it 's published by an organization with a hardcore and insane political agenda who have been found to be lying many many times . maybe they 're legit here , but unlike the other docs they do n't give us the option of checking sources . ) the free market also involves charging what the market will bear . a mercedes-benz s-class costs $ 100k in the us because that is what the customer is willing to endure . if there 's a market shift and suddenly the demographic decides that a more appropriate price point is $ 80k , then mercedes-benz will have to adjust its pricing . health care and education in other countries are not free-market because the governments intervene to control costs . the fact that it 's so expensive in the us actually reflects the free market - demand is so high that people are willing to go into debt to afford it , so what incentive does anyone have to lower prices ? if demand were to suddenly drop ( e.g. people getting healthier some other way , the job market shifts to value education less ) then prices would adjust accordingly . a free market exists where the buyer is n't compelled to buy , the seller is n't compelled to sell , information is symmetrical , and competition exists . cell phones : modern society makes purchase almost compulsory , and competition is limited . higher education is your best point here , and the market is arguably free . other countries drive the cost down by funding universities out of everyone 's pockets regardless of whether they go to university or not . nevertheless , foreigners come to america ( and willingly pay american prices ) because of the quality that our universities provide . while obviously cell phone plans are less regulated than other industries in the us , there 's all sorts of regulation involving the fcc , lots of historical legislation and regulation as well as a huge tax burdens placed on consumers ( -- url -- ) healthcare is one of , if not the , most regulated industries in the us . the us essentially gives out "" free money "" to students ( pell grants ) as well as being a huge lender to students and provide cheap and easy credit ( via student loans ) . corporations are n't duping the american people -- the state is . when you look at areas with a bit more competition , you 'll see that , compared to ireland , the us is cheaper . gas is much cheaper in the us , today at the pump i can buy regular unleaded for $ 2.40 per gallon , according to this ( -- url -- ) gas in dublin is 1.39 euro per litre . a litre is approx. 1/4th of a gallon , giving you 5.56 euro per gallon of gas , or $ 6.34 us per gallon for gas in ireland vs in the us . buying an apartment in the us costs ~ $ 1,800 per square meter outside of the city ( -- url -- + states ) but in ireland you 'd pay ~ $ 3,200 per square meter for the same ( -- url -- )"
9u4e2q,"donating to local charities is a poor use of resources i hear a lot of people saying you need to give back to your community . i am 100 % for the idea of charity , but why only those nearby ? why give your money or time to a nearby food pantry when that money is better used to help children get malaria nests ? or schistosomiasis treatments ? or vitamin a enriched food so children dont go blind ? i 'm seeing there is a proximity bias in that we want to make the area around us better . but resources go much further when used for international relief . singer provides the best argument here : -- url -- why give money to help a local blind man get a seeing eye dog when you could save dozens or hundreds of children ? why give money for gifts to poor children this christmas when others so desperately need it to survive ? in summary , using sites like givewell can help us give where it is needed most , even if we never see those people . i dont think me seeing a community change is enough to warrant the funds . rather i give where my dollar goes furthest . i 'm not saying that local charities are bad . i 'm saying they are less effective . people have feelings and i get all the feels when i donate internationally . also , why is it about my feelings ? is n't it about the people we are trying to save ? what about the feelings of these people in other countries - do n't they count ? what of you had your local child and the international child right in front of you . could you give the local child your donation ? it would absolutely break my heart ! we can save more lives if we spend wisely . it 's not about what makes me happy . it 's about helping the most people possible .","however , i would say that the idea itself is subjective . if someone wants to do something about homelessness in general , they can donate to a national charity . but if someone wants to do something about homelessness in their community , not because they are any less compassionate about himeless people at large , but because they can see the impact of it more readily or may be more personally affected by it . your view also ignores that a large amount of charitable donations can come as ' hours volunteered ' or ' in-kind donations ' . so when you say that donations to local charities are less effective than their national counterparts , do you want to only include monetary donations ? i would argue that these local institutions need funds to facilitate their volunteer efforts . some people choose to give to locally run charities because there have been reports showing that large-scale , international "" charities "" or non-profits actually spend increasing amounts of money on their internal operations rather than giving money directly to those in need . maybe you decide the local blind man can die in favor of vaccinating three children in africa , only to have those children be killed in a genocide . i volunteer at a local food pantry and with the red cross . the food pantry serves mostly elderly people and hispanic families with children . what if you factor in healthcare costs too ? those malnourished locals will have health issues , treated and paid for by taxpayers ( you ) . that 's a lot of money that could have gone farther in another country . people do what they can to help people and that 's a lot better than doing nothing . i suggest you volunteer locally , making sure it 's a position that you have direct contact with the people the organization is helping . because writing a check is not the same as looking someone in the eye as they tell you that you 've personally improved their quality of life . those with the scale of resources who are already giving are largely doing so for these national and international organizations . large , international charity organizations need large donations to get to work , and my $ 25 is n't going to make a difference to them . my $ 25 to a local charity in my town or city makes an immediate difference because they are at a perpetual fundraising deficiency , in part due to the amount of air the large groups suck up . they 're starved for cash and volunteers in a way the large multinational charities never will be . if you 're a multi-millionaire , yeah , it 's probably not the optimal use of your resources to keep it local in terms of the scale your size of donation can provide since the large organizations are counting on your support . local is 100 % the way to go , as your impact is much more significant . technically , any act of giving ( or taking ) can be rationalized as totally immoral if you weigh it against the opportunity cost of what all else you could do with that money , even if it 's the same number of people helped in either case . scenario : you have two kids , a and b , who are in equal need , but you can only afford to help one . in either case , the act of giving to one can be seen simultaneously as the act of deliberately and specifically not giving to the other , as if you had some special reason why you chose a and not b ( or vice-versa ) . also , even if you avoid the above conflict and reduce it to a simple matter of numbers , it 's still a callous judgment being made against the few to provide for the need of the many . that said , i am very skeptical of a lot of modern charities that do not provide very detailed accounting with regard to how their funds are distributed - it 's very easy to defraud a charity and redirect funds for personal gain without anyone ever knowing , if there is no reliability or accountability . as others have said , international charities are unfortunately often band-aids for structural and political issues that could n’t be solved by all the donations in the world . and if you ’re only willing to tackle problems that already have simple , efficient solutions ( or in many cases , band-aids ) , then you ’re ignoring a lot of serious , complex issues . financially speaking , funding malaria nets may be cheaper as a one time donation but will literally only buy malaria nets and not fix those structural issues mentioned earlier ( also think about who is producing these malaria nets and where the wealth is ending up ) . a local program that facilitates free vocational classes for victims of domestic violence may be more expensive to fund , but can better an entire family for generations . furthermore , the pool of people who can and will donate to international charities online will always be far larger than the number of people a local charity could expect to receive donations from . additionally , donating money and time to local charities is being a part of your individual community . sense of community responsibility and involvement is very very very important for society as a whole and has greater effects than boosting our own feelings . what is the point of saving hundreds of children from malaria when they will just starve to death or die from some other disease ? so we can build hospitals but the country has no qualified doctors nor has the funds to support it . you have to pay someone ( s ) to make sure the food ( or at least the majority of food ) gets to the people who need it . i 'm not sure if supporting one side of a war is something people expect when they give to charities nor would they want to ."
9u46hy,"angela merkel cheated her country by opening germany 's borders to any migrant who wants to come over . a country usually has a population which shares a same set of values and a similar culture . when you let in almost a million people that come from countries which do not share the same set of values , you create a divide . they do n't respect women ( as much ) , respect lgbt people ( as much ) and are not as well educated as the rest of the population especially when they come from third world countries . classes even need to be held for migrants to respect women in norway ( see the bottom ) . areas where migrant levels are high tend to suffer from high unemployment due to their lack of skills ) , high levels of poverty and high levels of crime . angela merkel essentially imported a massive burden into her country , one which the rest of the productive population has to prop up while they ( not all of them ) commit more crime . she is doing a huge disservice to her country by doing this , even if she only wanted real refugees from war torn countries to be let in , economic migrants came anyway . more than 40 % of german children are of migrant background . this is essentially destroying german identity as migrants tend not to mix ( islam requires you to only marry fellow muslims ) , and because their birthrates are so high , this could result in them making the natives minorities , which has already been done in frankfurt where people from migrant backgrounds make up 51.2 % of the population . this would all be okay if they integrated well but their backwards ( third world countries such as somalia where a lot of migrants come from have a very chauvinistic , intolerant culture ) culture makes it really difficult . their children might be more likely to adopt the german culture but it 's not a given . i 'm not a racist , i do n't dislike them for their skin colour it 's their culture , practices and actions i am more concerned about , i hope i could get that across . just so you know i 'm a white blond gay guy living the uk but with german citizenship by right of birth . norway 's muslim immigrants attend classes on western attitudes to women – video -- url --","surely someone that has lived in germany for all their life , with german citizenship , speaking only german , is a german . germany has a declining indigenous population due to a low birth rate and has done for years . germany is still overwhelmingly ethnically german , and most residents with an immigrant background ( i.e. are immigrants or have at least one immigrant parent ) are either from other european countries or turkey , and were already embedded in german society and have nothing to do with the current wave of immigration . regardless , the latest migration wave will certainly create a burden on the state in the short-term , but you have n't presented any hard evidence why this disparate group of immigrants will play out differently from past groups and where the threat to german society is coming from ."
9u3t0h,"nationalism is bs , i do n't see myself as someone who belongs to a country . so long story short , i do n't celebrate national holidays , i would thank the person who built my house rather than my country , and when i do stand up when anthem plays , it 's because people would give me the bad stare , otherwise when i 'm not in public , i just do n't care . i 'm also a strong atheist and find religion to be bs aswell . i might sound pretty anarchistic , but i would n't grab a weapon and shoot everyone , aight ? should i care about what happened in the past and where i live ? ( as long as it 's not in some shithole ) am i an ignorant fucc for not respecting the country i live in ? why should i care if 99 % of nations have the freedom of speech ? should i just pretend like i 'm a proud inhibitant of "" glory greatest country x "" ?","a nation is just a shared fiction , its borders and the laws we agree to follow are made-up by people and we agree to buy into those ideas even though it 's a fiction . with something like the european union , if you are a company who wants to lobby for laws to pass that benefit your business , then only having to influence/bribe a few politicians vs having to do the same for 20 individual countries , is a lot more open to corruption . the rise in nationalism is arguably a reaction to globalism where free trade and free movement is designed to benefit multi-national corporations . they can have an easier time if they can transport goods across borders or hire people from more places and move them to where the need is greatest or they can benefit the most . this has led to more people being exploited as companies move to where they can pay less for staff while still charging the same price for those products or services and not passing on the savings to the consumer , or helping better the lives of the employees . it 's also led to situations where some countries are also harmed by free movement with people from poorer countries moving to countries where there is work , but who are willing to work for less money and drive wages down because they know they will only be in those countries on a temporary basis to make enough money to move back to their home country eventually . there is little desire to improve the new country they live in , and they might even be taking resources from people who have paid taxes into a improving things like schools , transport , education and health . so combined with lower wages of people in the countries they have temporarily moved to , it also means that the countries they left are losing people who could improve the overall standards of that country . if they are good enough to find work in other countries then their skills are removed from that country . for example , a secular nation that values freedom of speech might have a sudden influx of religious believers , those believers when surrounded by others like them have a shared sense of identity , but if confronted with people who feel it 's ok to criticise their god or religious practices , then they might perceive that as being disrespectful about a value they consider to be important and so become hostile and conflict occurs . similarly , a secular group who value something like freedom of speech if told there are certain things they are not free to speak about and can not criticise will think they are being disrespected and this could create hostility and conflict , which is more likely to cause violence and crime . nationalism can also result in xenophobia and tribalism where people 's identity is based on being proud of things they have not done themselves ( or even know the person who did accomplish something . i can see a time coming where a person could move to a country that best fit their personal ideology , then nationalism would consist of moving to a country because it best fits your own values . for example , someone might move to a socialist country where they pay 50 % tax because they feel that 's the morally correct thing to do , and would rather live in a place where there was a good standard of healthcare , education etc because everyone agreed that they need to heavily contribute financially , whereas there might be another country where libertarian values were most highly prized . there would be fewer government regulations , lower taxes and general contributions , but the understanding was that as a result , if you do get sick or need to go to university you 're going to have to pay a lot for something of a decent standard . it would be like rolling the dice , you might never need it and end up with lots of money from not having to pay high taxes , or you might be worse off than if you lived in the socialist country and paid high taxes for things you might not ever use . there could also be countries based on religion or the state being free from it . by providing your support to a specific government ( even just by being a citizen and participating in the economy ) you are supporting the overarching ideals of that country . let 's build a scenario , with a "" bad "" government having a high degree of nationalism surrounded by "" good "" governments with low degrees of nationalism . my argument is that nationalism makes it easier for governments to enact their ideals on the rest of the world , and it 's important for the citizens to have at least some degree of nationalism in order for any government to have significant sway in the theater of world politics . that way , if the nation in which you 're living changes drastically and the quality of life of residents declines , you can at least try to go to another country where life/society/politics / economics/values seem to offer you a better chance . 1984 , though it 's a novel , gives a great image of how scary it would be to have one large , worldwide , globalist government . i do n't want them to have even more power ; governments of each nation should reserve some power in designing rule of law , etc . a second reason nationalism is important to me is the responsibility of each individual in that country , rather than being a "" proud inhabitant "" of the history of the country . if you are a nationalist , you feel a responsibility to contribute to , critique , and improve the nation in whatever way you have the capacity to do so . i worry that people these days are too focused on themselves and not on future generations . just because you do n’t see yourself as belonging to a country does n’t mean other people do n’t , nor does it mean they should n’t . most proud patriots are n’t proud because they get to point at people in 3rd world countries and say , “ haha haha , my country ’s better than yours ! ” you do your part in this effort and ultimately you 're proud of what the neighborhood that everyone has put together . moderate nationalism can be just like being proud of the neighborhood you and your neighbors helped create . it also helps serve the societal function of motivating people to to improve things in the country . it 's the difference in thought of "" i 'm committed to this community and want to work to make it better and will be proud of the results of that work "" vs "" this neighborhood is crappy ."
9u2g0g,"globalization is one of humanity 's ( unintentionally ) worst achievements i 'm not saying globalization is an inherently evil idea ( i mean , i 'm typing this on a laptop that 's arguably a global product ) , but these days i 've come to realize that our world might have been better off without it . i have several reasons for believing this : - the environment and the climate would have been better off . because of globalization , everyone wants to build sprawling cities and to manufacture all the things just to stay ahead in the competition . the economy may get ahead , but the environment always takes a hit . because of globalization , populations have grown far more than the planet can sustain and this means people have to go to increasingly extreme measures to get food - using fishing trawlers to kill marine life unnecessarily , destroying coral reefs , farming too many cows , etc . - next , there is now a redefined sense of fulfillment . globalization and consumerism seem to go hand in hand . i do n't hate capitalism per se , i just dislike the current form it seems to be taking . materialism and excess are now the keys to happiness - everyone must own an iphone , or porsche , or any of that stuff . there is no joy to be found in a quiet pastoral setting or a small village or an agrarian environment . everyone wants to make it to the industrial regions - be they cities or states . this causes overcrowded cities and with overcrowding comes crime and all other undesirable elements of urban life . what does this have to do with globalization ? well , everyone wants to make it to the more industrialized states thus not only abandoning the original ones , but overcrowding the destinations ( note : this has nothing to do with refugees fleeing war or political persecution ) . - globalization has propped up horrible people and regimes . some regimes only happen to be in power because some global ' powers ' and even less powerful states decide to continue to support them by buying natural resources from them . so long as the oil or diamonds keep coming , these horrible regimes are unlikely to crumble . - globalization has disrupted many social ecosystems . i believe that not every society should do things the same way ; cultural hegemonies are actually undesirable for the most part because societies are n't the same . forms , systems or minutiae of government and society do n't work the same way or have the same result across societies . not every country should be a pastiche of europe or america because the elements that work in these societies may become lost in translation when other societies decide to imitate them . i think societies should be allowed to naturally develop their own sense of government - one that works for them best . - ironically , globalization does n't seem to foster diversity . globalization seems to be synonymous with ' westernization ' . now , i do n't think that westernization is inherently a bad thing but as stated earlier , not every society in the world should be a pastiche of the west because it does n't have the same effect everywhere . globalization means everyone 's speaking english ( not a very efficient language , no offense to the british ) , wearing suits in hot weather , celebrating christmas ( no offense to christians , but christmas should n't be for everyone ) , etc . even when building sprawling cities , everyone 's just copying what the western countries do . no-one seems to care about being original or asking whether gigantic cities are even necessary and if so , why they are necessary . - globalization has caused an increased sense of dread . not only do we have to deal with horrible local news , we now have to deal with horrible international news ! the world is now more connected than ever , which means every locale now shares the tragedies of the world and there are a lot of tragedies in the world . this is one of the few cases where i can say that ignorance is bliss . i remember in 2015 or so when the news of the sandy hook shootings came up . i felt despondent for days despite not being american and despite having issues to deal with in my own backyard . this is n't even to mention the news of the frequent terrorist bombings that hit several countries like pakistan , etc . not to say people should have less empathy , but the world is crappy enough . i do n't think we need any more existential dread . note that globalization is n't strictly a purely western thing . i 'd say other than the west , the next biggest hegemonies i can think of are the chinese one ( economically speaking ) and the islamic one ( culturally speaking ) . my point is n't that globalization is an evil thing ( i 'd say it 's a neutral thing ) . it 's just that from a utilitarian standpoint , the world would have been happier in a gross sense without globalization in its current form . you can change my mind if you show me that my reasons and assumptions are mistaken/misguided , that globalization has done more good than harm , or that the pitfalls of this ' segregated ' isolated world with minimal cross-contact would be worse than the pitfalls of our small , global world .","early capitalists were able to ensure growth by improving the efficiency of their own work and production on a local level . but at some point , they had done all they could do locally , and they had to start looking outside their own local facility in order to make growth happen . as a result , they started collaborating with other people , first those they knew , and then ( as they kept looking for better and better materials because the ones they had access to locally did not yield the necessary growth in productivity anymore ) with people far outside their local sphere of influence , through trade . sooner or later , as millions of people around the world kept looking for more and better ways to increase their productivity , the networks of collaboration we are all involved in were bound to become global . if we want to keep this process going , then at some point , we will have to go into space because there will be no more room for growth on earth . but much like our ancestors , five centuries in , would not have been able to go back from farming to hunting and gathering even if every human being alive had wished for it , i do n’t think we can go back to a pre-capitalist world , anymore . then rivers start catching fire and pan arabism and africanism descend into chaos and all that awful stuff . but then what do you make of china , once a place of pure human misery that has been rocketing into the middle class on the back of globalization ? i do think though that its rise needs to be approached proactively , with appropriate institutions and ideas and general collaboration , or it could turn into an awful story , burying even its greatest success under rising seas and endless conflict . i think you 're broadly saying something like "" on balance , the mixing of cultures , nations , languages and countries has had a sum negative effect on humanity overall . "" there are a lot of benefits of globalisation that are easy to overlook or take for granted globalisation enables countries to stay independent and have to default to war travelling : most people ( i posit ) who travel find that travelling and seeing other cultures , how other people live , think , work and play , is a transformative experience . people claim to gain wisdom , understanding , empathy , and usually report to be happier as a result . all good effects of the internet : i posit that the internet as a whole could not exist without ' globalisation ' in the sense we 're discussing it ^ i 'm hoping this will kinda get your brain ' on a roll ' , but if you feel like your view would be changed through sheer volume of positive points on this list then we can go deeper here . globalisation allows countries to trade resources , and importantly , sets up a lots of non-globalized countries , like north korea , or the entire world pre-1900 , had terrible environmental policies . in fact , i think you can see a clear trend of more globalized countries ( scandinavia , western europe ) being more concision about the environment . ( sidenote , this reminds me of this essay : -- url -- ) i think this argument has some merit , but on the other hand : globalization means that i have access to all the music in the world ( not just the tunes my village fiddler knows ) . True , globalization sometimes seem to make everything into a weird grey universal-anglian sludge , but before globalization , everyone lived in a grey local-culture sludge . i think that in a mutually isolationist world , developing countries would be under more incentive to rapidly industrialize . while they would n’t be able to draw on the resources of global corporations , they would face annihilation by whichever adjacent country is more developed . your points argue that ceartain features of globalization are bad things , but i ’d argue that they are actually positives , at least from my point of view . one assumption that i ’m making ( which you are free to disagree with ) is that a lack of globalization would n’t mean that people are completely unaware of other countries . that is , the average educated person would be aware of other countries , the basic culture there , and the stuff they use . to argue otherwise would imply that something , either governments or some other limitations , was preventing people from even talking to each other . i feel like the environment is better off for having globalization . not having a global economy is not going to curb people ’s desire for products from other countries . the powerplants and factories that make them are just as bad . and if they are made throughout the world , from argentina to the congo , you end up with a whole lot of inefficiency , meaning more pollution overall . i could n’t imagine that people would want fewer cars in a hypothetical non-global world . people are n’t going to not want things just because the economy is n’t global . i feel like your are blaming globalism for a feature that ’s been in existence since humanity began . a global economy does n’t stop this desire , it only makes it easier to realize for those less well off . demand might fall only because people can no longer afford them , but unless governments do some sort of blackout or disinformation campaign , people will see this stuff , and people will want it . additionally , the humanitarian aid to people in poorer countries and the ability for other countries to accept refugees would be nil in a non-global world . that ’s a fact that ’s True regardless of globalization or not . to call some change in culture good and some change in culture bad begs the question of what makes a culture good ? i do n’t see how you could argue that the spread of western culture is bad unless there is someone with a gun to other countries ’ heads forcing them . so long as they are n’t forced ( which it does n’t look like you ’re arguing ) people should be able to shape their culture their way , even if it ’s just a copy of another culture . if you look at the world and see dread , then you should see the conflict that arose without globalization . rather than trade for things people wanted , countries just took what they wanted and needed , by force if necessary . today , they ’d just trade for it . but if they could n’t trade with other countries for lithium , then they ’d just find where the nearest lithium is ( chile ) and fight them . i ’d rather live in a world where the work and cooperation were encourage rather than discouraged , and globalization is the best way to encourage it . one day we will invent robots that can perfectly mimic the dexterity of the human hand , and thus make most labor irrelevant . at that point , a lot of your concerns about globalization will go away . robots will make it easy to have the same standard of living in rural areas as in urban areas , because they can build out infrastructure and transportation links at a very low cost and at a faster pace than any human can handle . would you be able to define for me what you see globalisation as and what your vision is of a world that does n't have it ? my personal view is that globalisation is the natural state of affairs : humans have always contacted other humans , and is what drives global progress . nationalism , a requirement for isolationism , on the other hand is modern , unnatural , and the cause of most of the world 's problems . globalization means that everybody wants to enjoy everything the world has to offer , and everyone has plenty of alternatives to offer what they have if they morally oppose whoever they 've been dealing with . for that reason , we get one dprk , whose leaders have to live in constant fear of the population learning of the quality of life in globalized countries and rebelling to get it , while the country itself lags behind in almost every aspect because it does n't enjoy the benefits of globalization that the rest of the world does . without globalization , we could have had ( and in a sense , have had ) dozens of dprks everywhere going unopposed internally and achieving the same level of power as their neighbors , whereas today you can probably name a handful of similarly oppressive governments at most , and most of those are checked and restrained by international pressure to some extent . globalization has created countries that took some elements from other forms of government and we can debate whether or not that 's a good thing , but i think there 's a much more important type of society that globalization enables : the globally sparse societies . subreddits are an example of groups of people who come from all around the world , share some basic rules and engage with each other in various ways that are peculiar to these communities . this includes other people grouped by shared interests , profession , etc . these communities / societies are diverse in the sense that members do n't necessarily have a gender or race within them , and they have the huge advantage of traditional societies that you can choose which ones you engage with and how . i find this much better than the non-globalized idea that "" you were born in estonia , now you 're part of estonian society , and if you do n't like it , well , tough luck "" . your great-great-grandpa may have experienced dread similar to yours that a plague will kill everyone he cares about , or that the king will burn his village for amusement , or that cossacks will raid his town , but unlike the sandy hook news , these would 've been real threats for him . this leaves us feeling "" excessive "" dread , but i think we 're much better off than if that had been justifiable fear ..."

if that was all , i 'd have no problem with the sub . there are many subs , like r/feminism , r/latestagecapitalism , and r/the","i would say that r/politics likely swings back and forth between political attitudes with the times , like the rest of the country tends to do . so i think you 're coming at this with the base premise that conservative sources of news are just as factual as everything else , which is in itself an implicit bias . suppose our president makes 10 stupid tweets every week , and his non-conservative rivals have their twitter accounts managed by a group of pr specialists , so they make 1 stupid tweet every month because the pr specialists are good , but not perfect . that means a truly objective , fact-based reporting system will have negative coverage of conservative tweets 40x for every 1x they have negative coverage of liberal tweets . this is not because liberals are stupider than conservatives , but rather because one major conservative in particular is atrociously stupid with no self control , and a completely neutral , fact-based reporting system must report his stupidity 40x for every 1x the opposing party is stupid . this naturally means that any objective political subreddit will be flooded with negative coverage of conservatives , not because people want to cheerlead liberals , but because that one conservative guy loves tweeting and has no real comprehension of how stupid his tweets look . suppose head conservative honcho starts doing very un-conservative things , not just tweeting , but like starting trade wars with one of the largest economies in the world ( against the advice of the rest of his party ) , or withdrawing from free trade agreements that his own party members worked hard to forge 30 years ago , or supporting actual child molesters running for senate seats . in situations like that , sources of news which do n't offer lots of negative coverage , whether they be liberal or conservative , are the True echo chambers . both liberals and conservatives should be offering lots of negative coverage of the current administration and if your preferred sources of media are not doing so , i 'd suggest it was you in the echo chamber , and not everyone else . the problem with the entire argument here is a basic assumption that all ideas are equal . however , all ideas are not equally valid , nor are all ideas worthy of a fair platform . thus the assumption that all ideas are equal favors those ( at least in argument ) whose ideas hold less weight . if you take a look at conservative ideas on

change your view is that simple : american conservatives do not generally have ideas worth being discussed or given a platform , and when they do , they 're probably being disingenuous about it ( aka lying / propaganda ) . the current conservative party in america is literally a criminal organization . read again : factually , actually , literally , a criminal organization is in control of the american government , and they cheated egregiously to get to that position . trump 's administration instigates a new scandal literally daily , and has convictions dropping left and right . he/they push insane conspiracy theories about everything and anything , and the nation is falling apart . your assumption that ' sanity and facts ' and ' lies , propaganda , and criminality ' deserve equal platforms is at fault here , not / r/politics . well one problem here is that right wing news sources are often too far removed from reality to be worth discussing . most of the popular right wing news sites are well known producers of fake news and the trump administration is n't any better . it 's just natural that left wing sources would get more upvotes than right wing sources simply because reality has a left wing bias . the left side agrees with the scientific consensus and tries to help the environment . the right side thinks it 's just a chinese conspiracy theory and they would rather make more profit instead . the left side is in line with the scientific consensus and they want to give those people the freedom to live freely . the left agrees with the scientific consensus and agrees that it should be taught in school . right wing arguments might work in their "" alternative facts "" universe , but they will automatically get downvoted by anyone that is n't a conspiracy theorist , religious nutjob or angry racist . and left wing sources that debunk their fake news will automatically get more exposure . i would say that any message board that promotes posts based on popularity rather than engagement will necessarily lean left wing , and this is not unique to the politics sub . then consider 4chan , which only promotes posts based on engagement . even their / lgbt / board has largely far-right sensibilities . this is why imageboard sites dedicated to left-wing politics need to be heavily moderated ; if they were n't , they 'd be overrun by right-wing posts . meanwhile , 4chan only moderates posts that have illegal content or are blatantly off-topic . they do n't ban people for posting left-wing opinions , and yet its userbase is almost entirely right-wing on every single board . in short , left-wing opinions can only thrive when moderators and/or users can censor opinions they do n't like . since you were looking at top all time posts , i counted 8 out of 25 about net neutrality . the problem is that you ca n’t force people to upvote conservative content . i agree with you that it ’s an echo chamber , i agree with you that more conflicting viewpoints would make it more diverse and interesting . it becomes abundantly clear when liberal topics consistently reach the top of / r/all and conservative views have pretty much never done the same . the sub is n’t actively creating an echo chamber because of rules or moderation as you claim , it ’s still open to either side of the story . the problem lies in the fact that it ’s by and far used by liberals and as a result liberal content is what will make it to the top ."
9tzy3x,"calls for regulation of social media to prevent manipulation is little more than condescension and contempt for people who have different viewpoints the people calling for regulation of social media are primarily upset that there are large numbers of people who have "" bad "" ideas . this is nothing more than poorly disguised contempt for people who do n't think the right things and a desire to control them . in fact , there is an inherent contradiction in the desire to regulate social media to protect democracy . how much do the people asking for social media regulation really care about democracy if they are trying to control what information their fellow citizens have access to and share with others ? this is tantamount to saying that democracy is good only if the "" right "" people are able to control the information and media available to the sniveling , ignorant , masses .","that sounds like the power to censor information being in the hands of a few companies . i think this had more relevance back in the 00s when most social media content you saw really was limited to content shared by friends or people you follow . this was back when social media was driven more by the potential , extraordinary growth , and inherent "" coolness "" of the technology and not immediate monetization concerns , primarily used by teens and young adults without significant political or economic influence ( they do n't vote or have money ) . but today , social media is heavily monetized by the companies that host them and the people and corporations that use them . a a lot of the content you see on social media now comes in the forms of paid targeted advertisements ; pages/accounts representing businesses and organizations with particular agendas ; and increasingly sophisticated fake users , both domestic and foreign , designed specifically to disseminate misleading , False , and divisive content . computer automation has made it increasingly easy and cheap to create these fake accounts and content at wide scale . increasingly sophisticated algorithms used by social networks to prioritize content at the top of your feed have created echo chambers for this content . advances in machine learning has made it increasingly hard to identify fake accounts , text , images , and now also audio and video ( e.g. deepfakes ) . the sheer amount of data we reveal about ourselves by our online interactions , combined with advances in analyzing big data , had made it increasingly easy to target messages to influence the most people . this is made worse by the lack of accountability of social media for handling our information ( e.g. facebook and cambridge analytica ) . these things need to be regulated to ensure that social media is not unduly influenced by the most wealthy and powerful entities such as large businesses , political groups , and foreign governments that can be hide behind anonymity or the veneer of authenticity . when large businesses , political orgs , and foreign power control what we see online because social media companies are only focused on monetization , user numbers , and user engagement , that is inherently disruptive to democracy . if facebook makes a good enough case to the masses that it is doing enough , the masses have the power over congress to prevent legislation . we vote on tuesday every other year , their jobs are on the line . and the reality is that many people get news from social media . it 's a truth vs lie issue and if the truth gets people to vote for one party or the other , that 's awesome . there 's a pretty clear link between the lies told on fox and in social media about the migrant caravans and the recent shooting in pittsburgh ."
9tzf4i,"america needs to take sexual assault and harassment more seriously , but locking rapists up and throwing away the key may not be the most effective or sustainable solution . hi there cmv . i 'm writing this because i 've gotten a lot of flak , in real life , for saying that i do n't believe brock turner 's sentence was "" too lenient . "" ( turner was put on the sex offender registry , which is effectively a life sentence ( of being on the registry ) ) . before i get to specifics , though , i should pan out . so , to start , i think the #metoo movement is much-needed and overdue . i think imposing social and professional accountability for abuse of power is righteous and just . that said - there is a worrying element of the #metoo discourse that emphasizes criminal justice accountability , with a broad brush , for a huge range of sexual misconduct . disclaimer : i believe that there exist individual instances of sexual assault that merit a criminal justice sanction , including incarceration . it may be helpful , if you want to understand my view , to read the following pieces : [ -- url -- ) [ -- url -- ) [ -- url -- ) in brief , i am concerned that the words of judge aquilina will become more mainstream : “ our constitution does not allow for cruel and unusual punishment . if it did … i would allow some or many people to do to him what he did to others . ” these are the words of judge rosemarie aquilina , who presided over the sentencing hearing of larry nassar , the doctor who pleaded guilty to molesting us gymnasts under his care . "" point 1 : rape is not a solution to rape . prisons are sites of sexual violence ( and ordinary violence ) , and if we sentence a rapist to prison , we are not doing so with the expectation that the rapist will be rehabilitated . if we are not sentencing a rapist to prison for life , he will likely emerge from prison , and if he is not rehabilitated , that 's a public safety problem . it is an uncontroversial statement that prison is criminogenic . point 2 : even if we assume for a moment that incarcerated people do not get sexually assaulted at disproportionate rates , the answer to america 's rape culture and patriarchy is not simply to incarcerate those who are caught in the act . i think the answer should be informed by deterrence theory . harsh sanctions in themselves are not deterrents , but certainty of a sanction is a very strong deterrent . ( if this seems wrong to you , please read this paper . there is criminology consensus on this point . ) in other words , i think that it would be better to punish 9/10 rapists with a sanction of , for example , 1 year in prison , than it would be to punish 2/10 rapists with 8 years in prison each . better yet , victims should have the opportunity to compel their attacker to participate in a restorative justice process , where the victim controls the consequences for the attacker and can exert influence over the form of restitution he is obligated to perform . ( i 'm obviously not saying that victims who want to press charges should be discouraged from doing so . but we need some intermediate measures , because criminal justice accountability is often really stressful , draining , and even damaging for victims who testify . ) point 3 : when we talk about criminal justice responses to sexual assault , it 's important to understand that the cj system was built to punish and separate marginalized groups . as pfaff highlights in the wapo piece i linked above , punishing individual criminal justice actors ( i.e. judge persky ) for individual acts of leniency will backfire in that it will cause all system actors to be more punitive when interacting with the demographics that they see most frequently : black and latino men between the ages of 16 and 30 . tl ; dr , we desperately need to fix america 's rape culture and misogyny , but you ca n't fix rape with rape or violence with violence . incarceration is , at best , a way to keep someone off the streets for a period of time . it does n't make incarcerated people better people or healthier people , and sentencing rapists for lwop or the death penalty is pretty disproportionate . ( we would n't have many men left in society , ha . ) i think the best solution is to increase sexual assault victims ' access to the justice system and other safety resources , so that victims feel more comfortable reporting , while simultaneously improving the quality of society 's response to s.a. and also offering options like restorative justice for victims who may not want their rapist incarcerated , but who want the state to impose some form of accountability .","i do n't hear a lot of people saying that violence is the answer to sexual assault . although you do n't explicitly state that only men rape people , you imply it multiple times by referring to hypothetical attackers as "" he "" and joking that the death penalty for rapists would lead to having "" not many men left in society . "" not to mention that you imply that all men are rapists or will rape in the future . your first point simplified is that raping the rapist does not deter future raping . i do n't think that the purpose of being sentenced to prison is to be raped . keep in mind that i am no expert on the subject . however if this is the case then being raped in prison is an unfortunate side effect of breaking the law and prison life . you say that because harsh sentences are not necessarily good deterrents , then your answer is to remove the sentences almost entirely . also having the victim have control over the consequences of the perpetrator could get very messy . it controls two or more parties with an unrelated judge and jury . you say that the criminal justice system is designed for affluent white people . and because it is designed for white people ( the greater majority of population ) , then punishing judges for leniency will cause judges to be not lenient towards minorities . armed robbery , that is stealing anything , even something minor , while brandishing a weapon , can get you the same prison term as rape . i do n't know about you , but i think someone who commits first degree rape is a much worse bet for society than an armed robber . i find a crime against a person 's bodily sovereignty much less rehabilitation-worthy than than someone who steals , even with a weapon . i think the state would be better off doling out shorter , less draconian punishments for property crimes and punishing rapists more harshly , especially in clear cut cases like brock turner . a person who does n't care about violating someone 's body that way very likely never will . a robber could turn his life around and never commit another crime ."
9tz5jg,"morality is not objective what i believe : morality is not objective , meaning there is no absolute right or wrong and that nothing is "" wrong no matter what you think or say "" , and that there is no moral code set in stone . morality is a social construct , and , when we try to argue right or wrong , the answer boils down mainly to what we value as individuals and/or a society . why : the idea of objective morality simply does not make sense to me . it 's not that i do not have my own moral code , it just seems arbitrary . "" why is murder wrong ? "" "" because it hurts other people . "" okay , well ... who decided the well-being of other humans is important ? we did . another reason one may give would be because the victim has rights that were violated . same answer could be applied . one more would be that the victim did n't do anything wrong . well ... would n't that just make it an arbitrary killing ? who has the ultimate authority to say that a reason-less killing is objectively wrong ? again , i do n't condone murder and i certainly believe it 's wrong . the whole "" objectively wrong "" thing just makes no logical sense to me . i 'm pretty sure most people believe that there are circumstances that affect the morality of a situation . but there 's more to why morality is n't objective . take topics like abortion or the problem of eating meat . a lot of pro-lifers and vegans are so certain of their positions that they think it 's objectively wrong , but the reality is their beliefs are based on what they value . when talking about whether fetuses and animals have rights there does n't seem to be a right or wrong answer . one side says animals have enough value that they should n't be exploited or killed for food , another says they do n't have value other than as food , but neither side can really be wrong on this . it 's just their opinion ; it 's not really based on evidence or "" absolute proof "" but what that individual person values . now these subjects are especially touchy to me so i could be very wrong about it . in fact the whole topic of objective vs. subjective morality is not something i 'm an expert on . so i 'm willing to consider any constructive input .","the only thing that you must grant to come to this conclusion is : the worst possible suffering for as long as possible for every conscious creature is the worst case , objectively . there are people who subscribe to objective external codes of morality . i think that there are objective constraints to what we can call ' morality ' . i may have a slightly different view on morality , so just a few points people disagree with often , but that to me seem defendable : - morality/moral rules are a social construct ; it 's the answer to ' what is good behaviour , what is wrong behaviour ' - the laws and customs of certain society in certain time are not what morality means ; we are trying to find what moral and immoral means through history and we are getting better at it ; slavery was always immoral , it 's just that people in certain time periods did n't behave morally - to act ' morally ' is a choice ; people do choose to act immorally ; even moral people sometimes do choose to act immorally because ' being good ' is sometimes impossible ( i.e. under some dire circumstances kannibalism ( killing people in order to eat them ) would be morally wrong , but it may still be the only reasonable choice to survive ) - there are certain questions where it may well be reasonable to act immorally or where there is no answer to the question ( trolley problems ) i think it is practically impossible to defend that if i killed you with the intention of using your car for a holiday trip is that i 'm ' good to you ' - for any reasonable definition of ' good behaviour ' , ' respecting behaviour ' etc . which would strongly suggest that there are some objective constraints to morality . the crux of your argument seems to be that the assignment of value is arbitrary , that there 's no legitimate reason it ought to matter whether anything experiences suffering . so i 'd like to address that with a clarifying question : do you think there is such a thing as significance of any kind ? this question really boils down to what you mean by ' morality ' . if by morality you mean magic rules that ca n't be broken despite a person 's intent , then sure - there is no such thing a magic . human diet has been studied now by physicians for as long as we have bothered to write down medical information about food . nobody denies that there is no objective standard of food that we should eat , that is perfect for all people . however , it 's as close to a medical fact to say that if you ate nothing but lard every day , that would be bad for you , despite it being perfectly fine to eat sparingly . it 's a lot easier to determine wrong answers than right ones , but that does n't mean that morality does n't objectively exist . in the same way that we do n't have "" objective standards "" of a perfect diet , we know how to move away from "" bad food "" and towards "" good food "" at least in principle . nor does it deny the possibility of having concrete iron rules in the future . for example , most people believe that food preferences are subjective . so , if you find yourself saying that pizza is the tastiest food , and you 're talking to someone who says that steak is the tastiest food , you will act in accordance with your belief that food preferences are subjective and agree to disagree . that 's not something that you would do if you really believed that morality is subjective . thus , it seems that you probably think that morality is actually objective . there have been attempts to describe objective systems of morality . a philosopher named kant 's proposal , i think , started with the premise that there is an objective morality . he used that assumption to demonstrate that any "" objective morality "" would be logically inconsistent if it condoned certain actions ( such as theft ) . there may be no single "" right "" answer , i certainly ca n't point to one , but if an answer is logically inconsistent , i think it is fair to call it a wrong one ."
9ty7qc,"current ( and possibly former ) government employees should not be eligible to vote in elections discussing this in a us-specific context , but if people have counterarguments that are n't specific to the us feel free . & #x200b ; my view is that government employees have perverse incentives way beyond normal citizens to always vote to increase their pay , increase the scope of government , to hide corruption in government , to tamper with future elections , etc . & #x200b ; and that the higher up in government the employee works , the more perverse the incentives become especially to support actions that will personally benefit themselves as government employees at the cost of the public welfare . & #x200b ; politicians will knowingly try to enact policies for their employees that will cause them to be voted back in , which is a feedback cycle that gets worse over time . things like increased pay , pensions , etc. should be fairly decided by the taxpayer and voters and in many cases government employees voting in large blocks will drown out these concerns . & #x200b ; extreme example : current and former cia officers running in elections should not receive ( potentially illegal ) support from their former coworkers that only weeks before they were working with to spy on us citizens . & #x200b ; allowing government employees to vote is one of the biggest reasons that the size of government has continued to grow over time , and this will continue almost indefinitely until a very large percentage of certain states work directly for the state . & #x200b ; also , i think there is something ethically wrong about being both an employer ( taxpayer ) and employee at the same time when casting a vote . it 's like voting for yourself in a way . & #x200b ; there are additional consequences in that political parties will then pander to government employees , and once elected the lines between government and private political party will become blurred , leading to further corruption .","my pay is negotiated between the employee union and the government 's board of commissioners , who know what my department does , how well we do it , the issues we face , and the areas we could improve . as an example , when my state implemented the affordable care act , we took on a considerable amount of new work , and the board took the new regulations and needs into consideration and authorized more hiring to manage them . it 's too far removed from john q public who just wants to stop drug addicts from getting food stamps if they 're not getting treatment . he does n't realize that workers now have to manage new regulations , administer urine testing , refer clients to treatment centers , and constantly monitor for relapses -- a ton of new work to add on to their existing workload . lastly , while i can vote for a new commissioner that promises to be more open during contact negotiations , they 'd be overruled by others on the board from different districts that i ca n't vote on . what 's the functional difference between a soldier voting for a politician that will increase army funding , a police officer voting for a politician that will increase police spending , and a private defense contractor voting for a candidate that will increase defense spending ? this is not unique to their employees . they will enact education policies to get teacher 's unions and soccer moms to vote for them . i fail to see what makes the government employees unique in this regard . would government employees ever get any pay increases , or anything that makes their lives easier , if they could n't vote for them ? the problem you hit is that government employees are hardly the only ones who make their money from the government . in fact you are incentivise further bureaucracy since instead of directly being able to employ people who care about the country ( and thus want to be able to vote ) you instead end up having to employ them through middle men who will take their own cut . your next problem is that government employees pay taxes and breaking the taxation representation deal gets into kinda dicey territory . you 've also failed to break things down by level of government . if yes you can get the same worker laundering as you get in the private sector ( technically all state employees are actually employed by a small town with a population of 4 ) if no you develop some really perverse incentives ( since federal workers ca n't vote in state elections the state has little incntive to provide them with any state services ) . finally government employees are on average better educated than the general population and have an extensive knowledge of what the government is up to and how well it is performing ."
9tx76z,"serbia has no right to prevent independence from kosovo . i 'll start off by saying i live in israel , a country known for its conflict with the palestinian nation . i think the palestinians deserve rights and a nation of their own if they will to have one . seeing israelis on the internet create diversion against palestine makes me ( even more ) ashamed of my country , so there 's no hypocrisy in my stance . it just feels to me like kosovo having to achieve independence from serbia in the first place is one big mistake . after operation 25 in 1941 , 75 % of modern-day kosovo was controlled by ( fascist italian ) albania . ethnically , kosovarët are albanian , so this makes sense , and the remaining 25 % were split between bulgaria and germany . when wwii came to an end , european borders were reassembled , and kosovo - ethnically , simply a continuation of an albanian population north of albania - ended up inside yugoslavia . when yugoslavia collapsed , we were left with the different regions , each nationality supposedly gaining sovereignty . the montenegrins , serbs and kosovarët had to share one land . kosovo has always been disregarded , but only misfortune can explain how they ended up having the same right for a country as any other region which achieved recognition , and now all you see is serbians fearing that they 'll lose a piece of land they have no ethnic connection to , ca n't speak the language thereof , and want to maintain control over . not to mention that there 's no justification to saying that land is serbian when in reality , it is only arbitrary borderlines that ever said it is .","there is nothing serbia gains by that and independent kosovo is violation of serbian territorial integrity . also , its worth noting that when yugoslavia split , some parts of croatia did n't want to leave and serbs were banished . big part of bosnia ( called republika srpska ) is majority serb , but they are n't allowed to be independent or join serbia ( cause doing so would violate bosnian territorial integrity ) . in fact , western world leaders are against northern kosovo ( which is majority serbian ) going to serbia cause it would violate kosovo \ territorial integrity . let me preface this all by saying i 'm not inherently against kosovo independence , though it may sound like i am in this message . there is a compelling argument to be made that both serbia and yugoslavia before it squandered any goodwill the kosovar albanians had towards the south slavic state , and i personally hold that tito made a great error in not raising albanians to the status of "" constituent people "" in yugoslavia . all that said , you do n't seem to fully understand the historical significance of kosovo to serbia or the ethnic history of the area . your argument that serbia has no right to kosovo based on historical claims is misplaced . beginning in around the 8th century , kosovo and the wider balkan area around it was almost surely populated by slavic peoples . for a few centuries kosovo switched hands between byzantium and a briefly independent bulgaria , but it ultimately was cemented as part of serbdom in the 12th century when serbian prince stefan nemanja secured it for his territory . during this time , serbs were listed as the main inhabitants of the area of kosovo by contemporary byzantine histories . in 1389 , an ascendant ottoman empire won a decisive victory over the serbian prince lazar on kosovo field . while this battle would fade into the annals of history for turks , it became a defining historical moment for serbs , in which their prince "" surrendered an earthly victory and kingdom "" for an eternal "" heavenly kingdom . "" the day of the battle is still celebrated by more nationalist serbs today , and the epic poem commemorating it is still widely taught in schools . kosovo 's importance to the ottomans meant it stayed firmly under the watchful eye of the ottoman administrators ; however , generally lax ottoman attitudes towards ethnic and religious minorities meant that serbs were able to build countless monasteries and churches across kosovo . likely albanians moved relatively freely to kosovo , as both territories were part of the larger ottomans . what is certain though is that the serb population took a large decline in 1690 , during the great serb migration , in which serbs fled north to escape perceived religious persecution under the ottomans . this marks one of the first times the ethnic balance shifted towards albanians . this shift was strengthened by the widespread islamization of albanians ; their willingness to work within the system rather than remain christian minorities made it easier to advance in the ottoman government . this combined with demographic shifts like the great migration meant that in the 17th and 18th centuries , albanians were able to spread into a somewhat de-populated kosovo . all that said , serb royalty never forgot what they saw as their historical land : land with their monasteries , the site of the 1389 battle , and with a clear serb population , previously a majority . after serbia got its independence from the ottomans in the late 19th century , the new kingdom proceeded to cleanse a large number of its muslim and albanian population from southern serbia . those people fled into kosovo ( still part of the ottomans ) , further increasing the non serb , non orthodox population . ethnic reprisals followed within kosovo towards the remaining serb population . fast forward to the end of the first balkan war in 1912 ; the ottomans have their balkan possessions cut up , and the modern territory of kosovo is split between montenegro and serbia ( both ethnic serb states ) . the serbian kingdom declares a plan to recolonize kosovo with serb settlers , hoping to restore its serb identity fully . at the same time , they begin a campaign against albania , claiming that albania has no right to independence and that serbia should have access to the sea . ( at this time serbia extends through modern macedonia , making the geography of sea access make a little more sense . ) the serbian military proceeds to burn down albanian villages to terrorize the local population . the post wwi era saw kosovar albanians cast as minorities with lesser status in their own country ( the newly formed kingdom of serbs , croats , and slovenes ) , and land reform ensured that more were pushed out of kosovo . ww2 then reversed this trend when , as you pointed out , the kingdom of yugoslavia was occupied and partitioned . critically , albanian fascist collaborators used this opportunity to seek retribution on the serb population . there was even an all albanian ss division formed ( although they proved almost entirely combat ineffective , likely due to not actually wanting to cleanse their former countrymen ) . rather , the new socialist yugoslavia was given its prewar borders -- including the territory of kosovo but not any territory from albania proper , which was a close ally of the ussr . albanian communists in albania were not friendly to yugoslavia , due to both the tito-stalin split ( albania stood by stalin ) and yugoslav slavic chauvinism towards albania . this led to yugoslav communists treating the albanian population in kosovo with suspicion and disrespect and ensured that slavs were given privileged positions in the government over albanians . muslims were also encouraged to leave yugoslavia and immigrate to turkey . despite all this , a much higher albanian birth rate ensured that the kosovo population became more and more skewed towards albanians . attempts at reconciliation failed ; first when the albanians in kosovo were rejected status as a constituent people and nation within yugoslavia , and then again during the yugoslav wars when the kosovar declaration of independence was rejected and kosovars were forced to develop their own political institutions in the face of repression from ( now completely nationalist ) yugoslavia under milosevic . eventually this led to armed guerrilla and terrorist fighting , which led to serb cleansing of albanians , which led to the nato bombing , the status quo peace in kosovo for almost a decade , and then eventually independence . serbia clearly has a historical connection to the land , as much as any albanian connection . being ethnically cleansed and partitioned by the axis powers does n't change that . if you want to support kosovo independence , do so on the basis of it being the right thing for its people based on current material conditions . failing to acknowledge the serb ties to the regions is a non-starter ; it 's not based in fact and no reference to the current , mainly albanian population will change that . if i 'm not wrong one of kosovo 's economic heartlands is actually majority serbian and until this is returned which i think has been proposed they have every right to oppose it"
9tx3lk,"there is no reason to own an assault rifle & #x200b ; i believe like many other thing ’s guns are primarily tools , however different types of guns are different tools with different uses . a hunting rifle can be used for hunting and i can see why some people would want them . a handgun can be used for self defense and i can see why someone would want one and could use it to protect themselves and their family . an assault rifle and other guns like that however seem to only have the purpose of killing a lot of people quickly and as such i think they should only be used by the military and police not by civilians . i admit it guns , including assault rifles are cool and if no one used them for their intended purpose i would be fine with people having them but we cant ignore it any longer , people , including children are dying and i see no reason for someones right to own a death machine trumps other peoples right to live . & #x200b ;","second , you say you 're alright with hunting rifles but not okay with ones that look tactical . the firing mechanisms are identical , the magazine sizes are the same ( not that that makes a difference in mass shooter situations but it might make a difference when a bear is after you ) , the muzzle velocity and accuracy of hunting rifles is actually higher ( because of the longer barrel ) in that case , they do have a legitimate function , and it ’s being abused . the legitimate use of assault rifles may not be as apparent as a motor vehicle , but they can be used for hunting , and in some cases self defense . it seems that your knowledge on firearms is very shallow and sadly the gun controll debate often includes one side lacking even the very basics of that knowledge.for people owning firearms it feels like discussing with flatearthers i think you clearly have little clue about how firearms work and what you do know is filtered information from the left leaning media . criminals and murderers will always find a way to buy assault riffles off the black market , but now you ’re taking it off the table for innocent people who could use the weapon to stop a mass shooter like steven willieford did with his ar-15 and stopped a mass shooting in progress at a texas church . the thing is -- there 's no good definition of "" assault rifle "" the two guns shoot identical ammo ( .223 remington ) , have identical magazine capacities , have identical rates of fire , etc . first off although similar a civilian version of the ar15/ak47 etc. is not a assault rifle by definition . two : my right to self protection , self preservation should not be dictated by the government number one , or anyone else , especially on the grounds that we should n’t have them because a few individuals who do not represent the millions and millions of owners of such rifles that use them safely , that have never killed anyone , that are responsible , as opposed to some maniac ( s ) that went out and committed atrocities . finally , god willing it never happens , if ever arose a situation where we needed such rifles , and the True purpose of the second amendment would be fulfilled . i sure as hell do n’t want to have to try and defend , my family , my land , myself and my country with a hunting shotgun and bolt action rifle . assault weapons ( full auto military weapons ) ca n’t be bought by civilians without extensive background checks and tens of thousands of dollars in expenses . now if you are talking about the ar-15 , those are n’t assault weapons . bullet fired weapon . they are actually just a hunting rifle with scary casing on them , but mechanically are no different . because the term assault rifle came from the german "" sturmgewer "" ( my german is n't that good i probably butchered the spelling ) which was named that way for the sole purpose of fear mongering . your average ar-15 is just a hunting rifle that looks different . you can get the the same performance out of a hunting rifle as you can out of a civil ar-15 . i 'm a sport shooter in sweden and i use my ar-15 for that purpose . if i want to adequately defend my home and family against potential threats , i do n't want to be the guy who brings a handgun to a rifle fight ."

9tvz4q,"i do n't think almost anything can stop the q'annon conspiracy , besides boredom and financial need . the basic essence of my view is that the q'annon conspiracy is so fully realized and accounts for literally any event as part of its narrative that i think almost nothing could stop it . if the q came forward and admite he was n't a political insider they would say that the "" death squads "" got him and they replaced him with an actor ( someone might even try to kill him ) . if president donald trump came out publicly and said that the conspiracy is False they would either a ) claim he is just trying to play 3d chess to fool those he is coming for , b ) he has been gotten by the deep state that poor man and they need to keep up the torch themselves , or c ) the fake news is giving us fake trump interviews . the only two things that could get people back to their senses are jobs being hard to get for people to spout this nonsense , or just boredom with lack of results . i find the boredom possibility more likely just because consolidation of people against employing q'annon supporters would be hard , stupid and dangerous , though it would probably still work in the end . i would love someone to convince me i am wrong and these people have a sense of reality under their thick hides of self-delusion . any change of my view is appreciated , but spicifily perswading me that these people will come to their senses soon would be great .

9tvwat,"people who denounce the poor for owning "" luxuries "" , just want the poor to know their place . luxuries to these people almost always include : smartphones , computers , nice sneakers , jewelry . anything that might stand out on a person as being a bit expensive . many people , unfortunately on the conservative and neo-conservative and libertarian sides , claim that these people own these things because they are poor spenders and it is a good example of why the poor stay poor in this country . i believe it is just the individual using whatever little resources they can to blend into society . to fool it into thinking that they are of nominal wealth , so they are n't bothered about it . so they can interact and find opportunity like any other normal-looking member of society with a smartphone and decent clothing . even worse , the political pundits , who make these claims are often of above-average wealth and upbringing , often with two parents supporting them in a stable home . ben shapiro and the roving millenial come to mind . both born into affluent families . that makes me take on this view that the outrage about this is disingenious . i rarely see someone who came out of poverty taking on this view , if ever . the roving millenial , who has a crtv show now , has even gone as far to say that you do not need a refrigerator to survive , that is it a luxury . what is next ? your shoes do n't have to be made of that expensive rubber , wear wood shoes ? if you want these poor people to contribute and find work , why do you tell them they do n't need computers and smartphones ? they 're affordable nowadays , but the accusers of these people always claim they have the "" new "" iphone , or that they scramble to buy the newest products . they do n't . change my view on this , do you/they geniunely care about their spending habits and the long-term effects on the country , or do you/they pick on them because you feel like they appear stupid complaining about being poor while possessing these items ? are the poor in a bad financial situation they 're making the best of , or do you believe they have a "" place "" to inhabit and should abandon all luxuries until they are out of that situation ? & #x200b ; & #x200b ; & #x200b ;","i think we get angry when they buy “ luxuries ” when they need to save money to get out of poverty . obviously not every poor person who owns a smartphone is a poor spender . that being said i work at the service line of a big phone carrier and you probably would n't believe how many people i hear from who ca n't pay their contracts anymore . it 's rarely the people who get a cheap sim-only plan for about 10 € a month . usually it 's the people who want the new iphone or samsung when it launches with the best mobile plan . they almost never have the money to pay for the phone right away so they take it on monthly installments and end up paying 80 € a month for the plan + phone . i mean i 'm poor but i have a $ 200 jacket that i got for 40 bucks i have a galaxy s9 plus but i got it on the super low low of 200 and it might be stolen because my brother 's an idiot and he owed me a lot of money . i think what people look down on is for example someone with low income buying the newest iphone or a huge 4k tv . i feel like i am repeating myself here , but again : there is a segment of the already poor population who remain poor because they can not control expenses . if you can not control revenue , which is understandable , at least be able to control expenses . if i were unable to control revenue , and as a result was poor , the logical next step towards retaining wealth would be minimizing expenses . sorry if i ’m late , or if this has already been touched on by someone else , but i did n’t see it and i thought it should be mentioned : i think most people do n’t denounce the poor for having phones or nice shoes , or what not . i think that people can easily see why and often enjoy pointing out why these people are poor when they have the newest iphone or the most expensive yeezies . having shoes and a smartphone are pretty much mandatory in modern life today ( the shoes much more so than the phone , as i know people doing fiscally awesome who still use flip phones ) , but having an iphone x is n’t . i 'm , if not poor , then at least not very well off . i think this is mostly my own fault for not having good impulse control - i have enough to cover my bills , pay off some debt and put money away each month , but instead i spend all of the money that should go towards debt or savings on things like drinking , takeaway food or video games ( gaming can be a frugal hobby but when i already have a big steam backlog to work through , buying new games is a bit silly ) . lots of people i know are in a similar position , spending £ 200 + each month on drinking , and then struggling to get by . people at all levels of wealth can be pretty stupid with money , but that stupidity hurts poorer people a lot more . if someone denounced me for wasting money on unnecessary luxuries i might think that was a bit harsh of them but they would n't be wrong . if people want to subsist ( live paycheck to paycheck , spend all spare money immediately ) that 's fine . if people want to save money against a rainy day ( or to improve their situation ) , that 's fine too . if someone spends at levels which they can only subsist at , then complains that their savings are n't increasing - then that hypothetical person is shooting themselves in the foot and is worthy of ridicule . i do think a lot of people are just saying these things out of bigotry and ignorance - for example , they see poor people with flashy expensive luxuries , and they also hear poor people complaining how hard it is to save up , and they assume that those are the same groups of people , when in fact the people trying to save might actually be being very frugal and are still struggling despite that . or maybe the people they 're criticising only have those luxuries because they were gifts from friends/family and it does n't reflect their own spending habits . but if someone buys the latest phone or other conspicuous consumption style things ( designer clothes and jewellery ) and also complains that it 's hard to save money , then they 're a valid target for this criticism . no , because some people also denounce the wealthy for owning luxuries . people denounce trump for his own gaudy displays of wealth , for example . there are different reasons people denounce this but sometimes it 's not about poor people but rather about the spending of resources poorly - on status displays - regardless of who is doing it . there are wealthy people who dress modestly and do n't drive flashy vehicles and so on . since spending habits affect what labor people end up doing , as money is used to motivate people to labor , you can be concerned when people spend unwisely - not that all of the items you list are bad purchasing decisions . now , some particular people may be denouncing for bad reasons and getting carried away with what they consider luxuries , but that does n't mean more generally that "" people who denounce ... "" are doing so like people of that kind always have the motive you ascribe to them . i knew people who are on food stamps who 'd spend an ungodly amount of money on jordan 's and upgrades their iphone every year . obviously not every poor person who owns a smartphone is a poor spender . that being said i work at the service line of a big phone carrier and you probably would n't believe how many people i hear from who ca n't pay their contracts anymore . it 's rarely the people who get a cheap sim-only plan for about 10 € a month . usually it 's the people who want the new iphone or samsung when it launches with the best mobile plan . they almost never have the money to pay for the phone right away so they take it on monthly installments and end up paying 80 € a month for the plan + phone . i do n't really "" denounce "" anyone but it does make me raise an eyebrow if i have a student that "" ca n't afford "" a notebook or other basic school supplies but can somehow afford expensive sneakers , a nicer phone than i ( i have never bought an iphone because of the cost and have one of the cheaper android phones on the market ) , etc . that 's super frustrating when they have luxuries i 'd tell myself i could n't afford because i needed to vs responsible with money . i do think some of that help is financial and structural but i think it 's good to also raise awareness among the poor how poverty has warped their spending because being poor -- for long periods and feeling it 's inevitable -- does make people splurge in ways they should n't financially and hinder their economic progress . i guess i would be one of these people , that „ denounce “ others for their spending habits ( i do n’t actually tell people though , since i am pretty libertarian and they can buy whatever they want ) if you are poor , you should spend money on necessary things and on things that will generate more money in the future . if you buy luxuries ( and i think this is where you listed terrible examples ) , that means , that you are not working toward those things enough and you will stay poor , because you suck with money . luxuries does not , however , entail things like a smartphone or new shoes . a luxury would mean getting the new iphone xs max or whatever it is called . also excluded are things like a single nice suit and dress shoes , to make a proper appearance when applying for a job ... when a guy is „ poor “ and gets himself the newest iphone every year ... yea ... he sucks with money . there are entire subs dedicated to giving financial advice to those who are struggling such as r/personalfinance and r/financialindependence . some of these people may be "" poor "" as in they have a negative net worth ( a shocking number of people fall into this catagory ) and/or they live paycheck to paycheck and struggle . people call into his show to let him say the same stuff to them . since we both grew up poor ( he makes more money than i do now ) but still we said we would help out friends and family , buy parents a house and give them a generous annual income , as well as take care of our siblings . when the money got tight , i stopped buying luxuries , budgeted my money , learned proper saving habits , and brought myself out of a bad financial situation . a lot of the women had their kids with them and i noticed that a few of the girls had smartphones . this was years before smartphones became ubiquitous , and i did n’t have one myself because my parents said it was too expensive . that experience did n’t convince me that poor people should n’t be allowed to have nice things , nor did it fundamentally change my ideas about service in general , but it did rub me the wrong way a little . my parents both made good money but they lived well below their means in order to save for college for my brother and me . i think the main issue is n't owning these things while being in a financially precarious situation , it 's that people want the flagship android or iphone or macbooks . this kind of technology has reached the point where it can be cheap and affordable but people want the best even if that means living out of their means . it does bother me seeing someone who claims to be in some sort of financial difficulty but seems to find the cash for the latest iphone when they could get a cheap android instead . i think it 's possible these people might just "" not know "" what it 's like to be poor , rather than wanting the poor to "" know their place . "" to fool it into thinking that they are of nominal wealth , so they are n't bothered about it . "" the roving millenial , who has a crtv show now , has even gone as far to say that you do not need a refrigerator to survive , that is it a luxury . "" when i say "" the poor should n't own luxuries "" its because of things like then it 's much harder to resist that latest smartphone or sneaker commercial because it takes bandwidth to fully see the consequences . if someone were to buy jewelry for themselves and i call them out for it because their children are starving or ca n't go to school because there is n't any money , it 's because i care for them and their children . a difference between buying jewelries and buying expensive jewelries you ca n't afford . a difference between sneakers because you need a new pair of shoes , or buying just because it 's trendy and "" everyone has it "" . i can afford a new phone , but why ? this one works perfectly , i do n't care if people think i 'm poor , as long as i 'm satisfied with my decisions . both of my parents were born in poor families , they are now pretty wealthy , but not because they spent their money to blend in , but because they saved money , worked hard and made good choices . people also judge you by looks and employers want employees who dress nice , have good grooming , hair and attractive enough appearances because they see you as the poster representative for the company no matter how crappy the job . think of it the other way around : some people have poor judgement and make poor financial decisions . that 's not to say all poor people become poor due to making bad decisions - there are a lot of things that can go wrong even for people who do everything right - but since poor judgement can make you poor , there are inevitably going to be disproportionately many people who have poor judgement among poor people , some of whom actually could escape their circumstances if they spent their money better . ( i do n't know if a smartphone and a fridge is going to make the difference there , but it 's hard to think of any one specific purchase that would be a good example of how someone has bad spending judgement ) . put simply : poor people ( in some cases , but not all ) remain poor not because they are intellectually deficient but because they are fiscally irresponsible . to say that looking down upon irresponsible and materialistic purchases is wrong is misguided and honestly concerning , regardless of social status . so let ’s use that as an example : i ca n’t control revenue but i can control expenses . the typical argument is not that they have these because they ’re poor spenders , but rather that they should prioritize their spending differently . in other words , if they live in poverty , they could be saving hundreds of dollars to put towards food , saving for an emergency situation , sanitary measures in their living spaces , things like that . also , things their children ( because most have them ) may need , such as school supplies , lunch money , child support , or providing them memories that make their childhood better , rather than just dropping hundreds of dollars on a phone or shoes or clothes . your claim that people want the poor to “ look ” poor , as if it ’s thought that that is how they ’re supposed to look , is just wrong . no one is expecting them to fit a stereotype . people expect them to prioritize their spending first , before buying this year ’s flagship iphone . it 's not hard to find people on / r/frugal who have actually significantly improved their life by cutting out luxuries . many ngos specifically give money to women in households rather than men because the men are more likely to waste it on luxuries while the women are more likely to improve their lives . from my experience it mostly comes from poor people complaining about being poor while spending money on luxuries every paycheck . it does n’t matter what you spend the money that you earn on , but do n’t complain about not having money when you spend it on luxuries that you can barely afford . if the ' poor ' receive aid from the government , that means people are paying through taxes for the ' poor ' to have resources . the i am working hard to try to earn something only to see it taken from me and given to someone else thought process . now , if the ' poor ' is getting aid and they have an iphone 10 , is it not reasonable to ask if they really need the aid ? there are many ' working poor ' people who makes ends meet without aid who do n't have an iphone 10 after all . the situation is definitely more complex than this simple situation describes but there is no doubt a person on governmental aid with the latest cell phone technology or satellite tv is very bad optics for people to see . i think the majority of the group you describe would love to see people not living in poverty . are you certain that the reason is n't that buying trivial luxuries is unwise when you are destitute and could instead spend your money on useful things but for example my step-sister is broke but she spent $ 25 on a "" jade face roller "" yesterday which sounds nice but she let me try it out and it 's literally just a rolling pin for your face . it does n't feel nice , it does n't massage your skin , it does n't relieve stress , it does n't provide minerals or anything it literally just rolls over your skin . this is a tricky topic , on one hand when i was poor i wanted to look rich . on the other hand i think we all know that you do n't need the newest of new iphones . eating healthy is expensive but everyone including the poor is encouraged to do so . also according to the statistics more poor people are bad with money than just having bad luck . however the friends i have know what they ca n't afford . they do n't drive nice cars and do n't have the newest smartphones . not the banks . therefore those loans which are being taken with no intention of them being paid are the ones which hurt our economy the worst . there 's not wanting poor people to have nice things , which is an attitude that i agree exists but is less prevalent than i think people want to believe , then there 's just wanting poor people to bring themselves up . i used to work in personal financial planning , i 'd meet people all of the time who were stressed about their money , wanted to save , and plan , and stop living paycheck to paycheck , but they went out to dinner 3 times a week , bought expensive shoes and clothes , always had the latest iphone which are getting to be pricey , etc . it 's not so much the choosing to spend money on luxuries , people should feel empowered to spend their money in whatever way feels meaningful to them . no matter what income level you are , you are always spending money at the opportunity of saving it . if you are asking for money from the government because you ca n't survive otherwise , then are spending that money on things you do n't need to survive , you 're wasting the charity you 're being given at the expense of the taxpayers footing the bill . if my brother tells me he does n't have enough money to dress his kids , then i give him money to put them in clothes , then he shows up and they 're still in rags while he has a brand new top of the line smartphone instead of the perfectly functional one he had before , i 'm going to realize he 's just taking advantage of me . the problem is n't with poor people having nice things . it 's with poor people saying they need a hand up or hand out to survive , then spending that charity on nice things instead of those necessities they claimed to need to survive . the dirty little secret that no one wants to admit is that the vast majority of people who are poor are poor because they have terrible money management skills . you can rent a room get a free mini fridge off craigslist instead of renting a whole apartment so you can stash money away so a car repair does n’t land you in the street . let 's imagine that you want a better life for people living in poverty . if you cared for this person and it was clear that the financial decisions that they made were important to the welfare of them and their family , it would be pretty understandable that you 'd want them to make sound financial decisions . let 's imagine now that instead of saving for their kid 's college fund , they lease a mercedes , even though a hyundai would do perfectly well . it is frustrating when people you care about make incredibly stupid financial decisions . the only thing separating this scenario from one in which you care that generalized people in poverty often waste money on luxuries is the degree to which you care . the people living in the subsidized housing drive fancier cars on average than my coworkers . people are abusing the subsidized housing rules , depriving people who actually need those subsidies , or 2 ) people with legitimate need of subsidized housing are making stupid financial decisions , condemning them to be continued financial ruin . the idea that either should not frustrate the people paying the taxes to subsidize either scenario is frankly tone-def . you can entirely explain the motivation for the thought your describing with good intentions . i suspect that this is related to the fact that people who are poor in the usa tend to be dark skinned and people who pay the most tax are often light skinned . in america right now , light skinned people are associated ( on the left ) with evil paternalism and dark skinned people are associated with virtue . mother was a nurse father worked in automotive assembly plants . he worked his whole life busting his ass and saving money , not taking vacations when people around him were at every chance , not investing his money stupidly , never buying the nicest of things because it ’s completely unnecessary to have the 256 gb iphone 10 when your iphone 7 works fine . he gets angry when people blame people with money for other people not having money . it does n’t upset him because poor people have nice things . it ’s not being upset poor people do n’t know there place , it ’s that they ca n’t help themselves , and that feeling of helplessness is heartbreaking . i would like to point out that neither luxuries nor poverty need to be permanent . i had a lot of your typical "" high income household gadgets "" , but then poor luck and bad timing combined with me losing my job happened , and the result : loads of "" luxuries "" but really struggling to make ends meet , and severely behind on all sorts of bills . we managed to pull through it , but for a time i felt that my belongings were reminders of better days , while we lived in one of the most cramped apartments you can imagine . most people waste money on luxuries they can not afford . i know so many people with "" money problems "" they 've invented themselves . if you wont live frugal , that 's your problem regardless of your pay . if you 're not living on eggs , rice , peanut butter sandwiches , or ramen , etc. , then there 's more you can do to put your money to work for you . i would argue that many conservatives are n’t denouncing the poor for owning luxuries . rather , they are denouncing government spending ( and , by extension , taxation ) for providing funds for luxury goods . the conservative fiscal policy does not want any room for wasteful government spending . allowing food stamps is possible for most modern conservatives , but if a person receives ssi or similar monetary assistance , those government dollars should not pay for any luxuries . under this mindset , it is n’t that conservatives do n’t want poor people to have any luxuries , they just do n’t want the government to pay for them . the point here is making sound financial decisions , which many poor people do not . he grew up in a pretty mixed area financially . he grew up in relative comfort ( both parents worked in education ) , but there were many people near him either near or below the poverty line . he said the number of people who drove expensive cars to the laundromat was shockingly high . generally , for everything from smart phones to appliances , you ’re better off not buying a fancy name and instead buying a functional but not flashy alternative . and , if you have financial issues , not caring about brand may allow you to buy more of things you need responsibility . it all depends , if they ’re poor but buying luxuries does n’t prevent them from providing basic necessities to the people they ’re responsible for than do whatever you want . but if you are poor and your buying luxuries while your kids are starving , then you have every right to be scolded . also as a general rule of thumb , i never tell people how they should spend their money unless they ask for my opinion i ’d like to think most critiques of poor people owning luxuries like an apple watch , airpods , jordan ’s or any entertainment amenities are critiques of the fiscal irresponsibility of the purchase rather than a “ know your place ” view based in classism . i think the human experience is nuanced and people with different viewpoints can use the same phrases . i 'm sure there are people who just want the poor to know their place . however , others legitimately question why someone who is receiving subsidized housing , food , etc. has money to spend on smart phones , ipads , or other expensive items . op in fact mentioned it , i thought "" some people even go as far as suggesting people use library computers . let me preface this by saying that unless you earn the money you do n't get a say in how someone spends it , and while you can judge people for questionable purposes it is always used inherently as a way to think that you are better with the spending that you choose to do . when people judge purchases what they are really judging are peoples priority 's . when people live beyond their means and go broke doing so that hurts society because we end up having to bail people out . look at for example the various homeless outreach , or food assistance programs that we spend money on . if people had better spending approaches then we would n't have to spend money on those things . this is important because that 's money people could be spending on themselves , but because people want to live above their means others have to set aside money that the government collects so that we can help those who are irresponsible . as long as people have to pay for the poor financial decisions of other people that judgement will consist because of the first premise that i started out from . most of the time these things are seen as luxury purchases because you are paying for extra performance , styling , and brand that are not needed by the average consumer . when most people criticize people for owning smart phones it 's not the fact that it 's a phone it 's the fact that it 's a "" luxury "" phone . but if i know someone who is always struggling with money , but they also have to get the latest and greatest , i 'll definitely judge them . people can buy what ever they want with their money ; that 's what money is for . you ca n't require a minimum income before allowing people to buy things . that being said people should not complain about their own poverty while making poor financial decisions , but , ultimately , if someone poor is happy to buy a smart phone , they should not be denounced for it . there ’s a difference between buying $ 160 dollar top of the line basketball shoes , or buying $ 12 sneakers from walmart . it ’s not “ wanting the poor to know their place ” to say that people with less money will be more financially stable if they buy the cheapest option until they can afford better , is it ? i managed a pawnshop for a decade or so and had alot of poor people every day . i saw first hand that alot of them were poor due to poor decisions and lack of saving/buying luxury goods . the next week a bill would be due and they would be back to pawn the stuff they bought and alot of times end up losing it . other customers would get say a $ 100 loan which was $ 10 a month interest , pay it off fast and you dont pay alot . some customers would pay on that item for years , they may pay $ 500 on that $ 100 tv . theres just alot of bad decisions from the poor population as a whole , not saying everyone that 's poor makes them . i believe you are right when stating that no one wants to appear poor and buying a smartphone or designer bag makes them feel like they appear to not be poor . i 've been poor at a point but now make great money , it made me get my finances in order and get where i am now because i hated it . i believe most poor people are there because of bad decisions or being lazy , some due to bad luck or job loss . overspending on luxury goods is not making the best of it though , and that 's what these pundits just love pointing out . being ' rich ' is not about income stability or real success to most people , just the projection of those through frivolous things such as flashy smartphones , cars , sneakers , jewelry , etc. , which often reduces a person 's ability to accumulate wealth . it 's really the poor people living in a 1 bedroom apartment with their kids sleeping on the floor while they have $ 5k rims on their cadillac . if you ca n't find a way to either make money off of it directly or use it to get money making leads , then you 're not doing yourself any favors in the not being poor category . if you 're deeply poor and choose to spend money on non-essential items , you 're making a poor financial decision . people are simply saying the poor person owns some of the responsibility for their choices . people either have agency or they do not . if they do have the power to choose and effect their life 's outcome , then they also have the responsibility for the decisions they 've made . you ’re supposed to either be thankfully gushing appreciation to your overlords or quietly appreciating the handouts you ’re given . this has been the ethos of america from day 1 , if you ’re poor here it ’s your own fault and you should be thankful there ’s a safety net in place helping you at all ..... some people have terrible spending habits that trap them in poverty . some people spend wisely , which includes just enough luxury not to broadcast that they 're poor . the thing that always bothers me is someone with kids who do not eat well , live in a dump , but you see driving a sports car . that is n't just poor people though , that 's anyone . i 've been to actual poor third world countries and seen what "" real poverty "" looks like . the typical "" poor "" that is thought about here in the us is more of a relative poor ( ca n't afford really nice things ) , and i 'm not talking about homeless people . if a person ca n't afford to pay their bills on time or get out of credit debt , but makes sure to have the latest iphone model as soon as it comes out then yes they should be denounced . in a country like the us , it absolutely is spending habits that keep a lot of people in poverty , maybe not all , but definitely a large amount . if you look at many well off people who are smart with their money , you 'll see they could n't care less about keeping up with the joneses . that 's also related to what people mean when they say that poverty is a mindset . and just lol at the guy that said a computer and a smart phone are n't luxuries . as far as i 'm concerned , having running water is a luxury , being able to change the climate in your home at will is a luxury , as well as many other things we all take for granted . i 'm sure you can find extreme cases of people denouncing the poor for owning a fridge , but on the whole i think people just find poor finance management the issue . there are ways to save money and increase your standard of living , and the easiest and most visible way is pointing out the luxuries they have arguably wasted money on . arguing about money causes lots of stress on young marriages and being responsible is a way to avoid it . i 'd hardly call a smart phone or a computer a luxury . if they could be putting that money into paying off debt or using that money to buy "" luxuries "" instead of paying their bills and end up having to use taxpayer based services to be able to make ends meet ... yeah i 'm gon na denounce them . if they have no debt and all their bills are paid and do n't have to depend on government to live ... i do n't care if they want to spend their hard earned money on luxuries . depends on the situation , but most people who are poor are usually in debt and many use government assistance . when i 'm talking about poor people , i 'm talking about actual poor people . if i see someone in that situation and they are spending money on items that they do n't need regardless if it 's a luxury item or not then i think that 's ridiculous . then it 's much harder to resist that latest smartphone or sneaker commercial because it takes bandwidth to fully see the consequences . i think this is a really interesting viewpoint , and i agree that there may be some underlying bias that makes people want the poor to “ know their place ” . with that said , i do think there ’s more to it than just bias . those who suggest that the poor should n’t own luxury items are reacting to the claims we hear so often that the poor / can not / afford things like food with the money they make . the legitimacy of this sort of claim is seriously undermined when it seems clear that the poor / can / afford food , since they can afford items less important than food ( eg a smartphone ) . that matters because when we talk about the state ’s responsibility to the poor , we generally agree that we have a responsibility to make sure people have basic necessities and wo n’t die . we do / not / agree that the state has a responsibility to make sure people feel like they can “ blend in ” with the rest of society by owning luxury goods . thus , if that is truly why less affluent people are spending their money on luxury goods , then their spending should not be subsidized as much by the government ( eg by providing food stamps , which allows money that would otherwise have been spent on food to be re-allocated to those luxury goods ) . i re-iterate that i do think your bias point still is somewhat legitimate - but i do n’t think it entirely undermines the opposing viewpoint , either . quick edit : i also realize i ’m vastly over simplifying here - goods are not either “ food ” or “ luxury ” - but the core of my argument remains the same . i 'm sure you can find extreme cases of people denouncing the poor for owning a fridge , but on the whole i think people just find poor finance management the issue . you can save up to buy a nice tv or shoes but if you get one on a terrible rate loan that eats all your income for months it was clearly a bad decision to buy it and the reason you are struggling to make ends meet . someone who did n’t have cell phone until their 30 ’s or 40 ’s or who scheduled time at the computer lab while in college/at work is n’t necessarily going to understand why someone who is poor considers a smart phone and personal computer to be a necessity . for example , public safety announcements such as tornado warnings and flash flood warnings are issued over cell phones . if you are away from your home noaa radio without a cell phone , you will not get warnings in a timely manner . expensive sneakers ... i honestly do n’t understand why a poor person would spend more than necessary on clothing . the rich person is not likely thinking about the poor person 's accepted place . they are only thinking that if they ran in to financial difficulty then they 'd cull their spending in some way . so they see poor people having "" luxuries "" as not responsibly culling their spending . they are wrong about the situation and have a severe lack of perspective but that does not mean they are trying to keep poor people in their place . far too often we see stuck-up self obsessed douchebags criticizing poor people for having a smartphone or buying cookies at the supermarket or having tv and so on . however , in a small minority of cases , there are middle class people with serious spending problems who do blow too much money on upgrading their phones every year or two , or financing more car than they need ( look at all the 7 and 8 year loans ) , or eating out too often , and so on . these people absolutely deserve criticism . but again , they are a small minority of "" poor person owns supposed luxuries and ca n't make ends meet "" . if a poor person is spending thousands for the new iphone or yeezys then yeah , they deserve to be called irresponsible"
9tvpzd,"apu from the simpson ’s is a racist stereotype to address some points up front : 1 ) was the appropriate response to remove him from the show ? i do n’t know , this is not a democracy , the people in charge of the show decide that . 2 ) is n’t the show full of negative stereotypes ? yes , most of which are not racist , even if they are derogatory or prejudicial . but apu ’s depiction relies on perceived racial characteristics being depicted negatively , a form of racism . 3 ) the show shows white people in a negative like , look at cletus . the show shows white people of various cultures having flaws sometimes associated with their culture or heritage and sometimes just individual flaws . apu ’s flaws are often but not always a result of his heritage and no effort is taken to depict a diversity of indian people . even if all white people were depicted as uptight evil racists unable to dance , that does n’t change that apu ’s character is still itself a racist depiction of indian people . 4 ) apu is a successful doctor and a great role model for indians ! he is successful , but is still a racist stereotype , even if he has some of the good stereotypes associated with him , like being an indian doctor . 5 ) it ’s just a cartoon ! that ’s not a free pass from criticism .","because he seems like a very happy guy that likes his path of life . linking him to a "" racist stereotype "" is up to the individual since it is n't outright said in the show . or because you 've seen lots of indians as doctors ? those would really be the only way to link it to stereotype yourself . slapping "" racist "" on there is up to the individual to think of it in a racist manner in some way . if apu is just an indian that happens to live in springfield that chose to be store owner and a doctor , would n't it be racist to slap the term racist stereotype on him ? so no , i do n't think he 's a "" racist "" stereotype . i think racist comes in when you think a certain race is n't capable of changing something or is incapable of doing something else because of their race . it 's a stereotype of indians ; indian is not a race . it 's a stereotype of nations in the same way depicting a french person with a baguette and a baret . note that i do n't see how a stereotype of a race is anywhere different from a nation or a profession or a gender or a subculture or whatever but for some reason people react more negatively to when it 's about race . you 're saying in point 2 ) that despite there being other stereotypes , he is depicted particularly negatively . but then you acknowledge in point 4 ) that he 's depiction is entirely positive . even though it makes people mad that they just dropped him and even i did n't want him to be dropped , i totally sympathise with why they did it . no matter which way they went with him it would have upset people : he 's already one of the more nuanced well-rounded characters in the show so giving more depth & back story to him obviously has n't worked . and if they wrote out stereotypical aspects of him , such as the hindi inflected accent or if they got him divorced from his arranged marriage , he would n't have fit in in a show of stereotypes and people would still be mad anyway as there 's wrong with having an accent or arranged marriage that it needs to be erased from any depiction of indian people . it 's been a few years since i 've seen the simpsons , but i recall him being a kind lighthearted indian man . its not racists because apu is loved by the characters in the show and loved by the viewers out of it . people who think he is a stereotype are actually the racists because they think indians are more likely to be like apu . no , being a cartoon and a comedy is n't a get out of jail free card , however , it does not change that apu is not a minority in having his race made fun of . ask an alt-right guy about what they think of homer simpson as a representation of the patriarch of the american family . remember : literally no one cared about any of this prior to whenever we decided that we 're now forcing society to become equal and inoffensive , as opposed to letting it happen organically . the problem is that there were very few representations of south asians on tv , and for many americans apu was their only introduction to the culture . is the best explanation i can find of why apu is not racist ."
9tvnye,"i think birthday parties for a one year old are absolutely ridiculous ## - the child is too young to understand or appreciate anything . of course invitations are made and make you feel like you have to bring a gift , which seems pretty much like a pity party . \ - now , if the party is more for the parents to hang out , that 's fine , but if that 's the case , why not just invite people over and specifically say not to bring gifts ? \ - honestly not trying to be sexist either , but these parties are solely organized and promoted by females . it seems to me that many "" get togethers "" are a political must for women because of how they will talk amongst themselves about who did n't show up with all their "" omg shelly is so rude its not like she 's doing anything today anyway . "" \ - my opinion has been met with some hostility in my friends group , so , cmv . & #x200b ; & #x200b ;","and because gifts are customary at any age , their inclusion make the birthday party feel more valid . it literally does n’t matter whether the baby remembers them or not , the gifts ’ purpose is to legitimize the party for everyone involved . the only obligation you should feel in attending a 1st birthday party is to your friends or family , because this is a major moment for the parents . your buying a gift helps legitimize the birthday party itself . yes , those parties are more for the parents and their friends and family . though i do n't really see why it still ca n't be a birthday party !? when our son was one year old we both organized the party and actually only family was invited . the party is to celebrate the child , allow extended family ( and close friends ) to spend with the child to facilitate bonds and to allow new parents to foster friendahips with other parents they may have met via parenting classes , mommy/daddy and me class , etc in the past year . gifts are given both to celebrate the child and to show support for parents who are always in need of something . it ’s pictures , memories , and gifts to share in the future , even though the child wo n’t be able to comprehend them for a few years . they matter a lot to grandparents who could be gone any year to use any chance to make the memories with their grandchildren without being overbearing on their kids and these parties are an opportunity to do so . generally , every 1 yo birthday party i 've been to has been a ' come celebrate with us , bring your kids , or do n't , whatever , we want to see you ' . there has n't been any expectation of gifts , and the gifts that are brought are either a ) some booze for the parents or food for the party , or b ) some silly little nothing toy , a truck or hand me down book or whatnot . if someone is behaving childishly with expectations for their 1yos birthday party , then yeah , your statements are True . but the behavior you seem to be describing ( pity party , obligations to bring a gift ) are actually just \ generally poor behavior which would be absolutely ridiculous irrespective of who the party is being thrown for \ . i 've definitely been to birthday parties for adults ( 20 yos , 40yos , 80yos ) where they act this way , and it 's still poor behavior even when done by adults ! first as you said its a chance for the parents to spend time with friends and family , parents of small children usually do n't get to go out very often so having an excuse to get to see everybody is going to get jumped on . going to a first birthday party is a chance to get more quality time with them and build a stronger relationship with them . third to address your point about the giving gifts to them and they wo n't remember who bought them , the parents will remember it . the point about it being political for women seems like that is the group of women you are spending time with . there are caty men who will gripe about who did n't come , there are people who just want to spend time with the people who chose to came , its not a birthday thing its a friend group thing . if you feel obligated to bring a gift while that ’s not specifically stated that ’s on you . you might argue we could make it just a party without saying it 's a birthday party but making it meaningful with the first yearly milestone with cake and presents just makes it more fun . it is partially for the parents , i understand that - but you also have to look at it as a birthday party for someone who has lived another year on this earth . the reason people feel slighted if you miss or think it 's dumb to celebrate is often because they feel like you do n't care about their major , time intensive expensive achievement . in most places , birthdays are not to celebrate one persons day ( selfish ) , but instead allow everyone to celebrate with that person ( sharing ) . the party may not be for the one year old at that moment , but they will eventually be old enough to love and appreciate the pictures and stories from the moments where they reacted to their first cake , or pulled away wrapping paper for the first time , or made an absolute mess . if your argument is that "" the social requirement to being presents to the birthday party is wrong "" , though , i would agree . here 's my conception of a birthday party : it is an occasion where people get together . they have something to celebrate , and gifts are part of the activities of the day . if an invitee is in a dire financial situation , gifts can end up being negative experience , but a small thoughtful gift goes a long way to show appreciation without much financial burden . you bring gifts because you 're not expected to pay for your food and drink or obligated to help clean up . even in the case of a general dinner party , people bring things to help take some of the load off the host . even when not expected to bring anything , people still do , and even when not obligated to help with cleaning up , people still do . actually , no . they may not remember it in the traditional way that we consider verbal memory , but human interactions during early development massively shape the psyche . giving your child a wide berth of positive interactions early on can have big implications in the development of their social brain . having a kid is stressful and time consuming , you lose a lot of social time . keep in mind , i spent more money on the bday than i got back in gifts , so it 's not really a pitty party . gifts are both a nice thought and a way to subsidize the party ."
9tvi1d,for the last 25 years there has been no significant systemic liberal bias in the mainstream media . for this particular argument i will be focusing mainly on cable news but i believe the arguments can be easily generalized to the media as a whole . before 1996 cable news was significantly neutral with a slight liberal bias . very little opinion was broadcast as fact . in 1996 fox news was founded and immediately began to change the landscape for cable news . more opinion programming was introduced and fox news was quickly established to be a conservative media outlet . in response more and more opinion programing was introduced on cnn moving them away from a general neutral bias . but the overall neutral bias of the system was maintained . in 2002 fox news becomes the highest rated cable news channel in the united states . cnn and msnbc combined edge out fox news for total viewers . more and more bias on both sides is introduced over the years to come . but overall total bias is neutral . by 2018 fox news has maintained its top rated status for 67 straight quarters . fox news has 9 of the 15 top watched programs on cable news and has roughly the same viewership as cnn and msnbc combined . fox is the de facto voice of conservatives in the united states and the main champion of president trump . cnn and msnbc are part of the system but they are not the whole system . the whole system contains fox news and every other conservative media as well as the liberal ones . fox new 's views are held by a roughly equal number conservatives as cnn or msnbc views are held by liberals squarely placing fox news in the middle of the mainstream media . with both liberal and conservative bias held by competing and almost equal sides of the media there can not be said to be a systematic liberal bias to the mainstream media . people that remove fox news and other conservative media from the mainstream media and accuse the media of having a liberal bias are just plain wrong . cmv .,"fox news is biased and they use different biases which include selection and using questionable sources and the like . on the other side , cnn and many like it have a different more insidious bias . they use bias by omission and bias by selection to fail to provide you the whole picture of a story and by emphazing some story types over others . this allows people to say "" cnn did not lie "" and "" cnn reports the news "" . what they do n't say is cnn chooses what to report in the stories and which stories to share in order to shape a specific narrative or worldview . both are bad and if you are moderately informed on a story before hearing the msm ( abc/nbc/fox / cbs ) report on it , you will be shocked at how much they leave out to shape a specific desired view of the story . lets define the msm shall we . typically this is the major tv news outlets and a few major newspapers . in the tv broadcast media , the overwhelming majority of news outlets lean liberal with fox as the sole right leaning . in the newspapers , again , most lean liberal with a few exceptions . it is clear from that that the majority msm news outlets do in fact lean liberal . unless we as a country license journalists with a set of ethical rules like we do doctors , engineers , and lawyers , i do n't think you will ever get a ' credible/complete ' news source again . well , i think that people are wrong to not count fox news as a mainstream media source , but that does n't necessarily mean that there is n't significant liberal bias in other media outlets . for the record i think that apart from msnbc most media outlets are n't too terribly biased towards either end of the political spectrum , but you seem to be saying that fox news essentially cancels out any liberal bias that exists . i do n't think that 's necessarily accurate , because the bias still exists in that case , it just is n't reaching viewers of fox news . bias is not only presenting opinions as fact , it is also choosing which facts to present , which can manipulate people 's opinions . fox is well known as a conservative echo chamber and is not taken seriously by anyone other than conservatives . so i would n't say everything balances out , despite the viewership . watch any show on their networks and the bias becomes just as clear as fox news ' bias . first , you present the biases as "" equals "" . i think this is grossly flawed - fox is far more biased than either of the other big two . but , more to my point , i 'd argue that cnn actually carries a de-facto conservative bias through being insufficient in calling out their conservative guests , and in treating their lying/misleading/conspiracy-theory-mongering conservative guests as if they are somehow on equal footing deserving to be debated as equal and opposite sides when in actuality they are completely detached from reality . by allowing for this False-equivlancy to fester and keep going on , to allow utter insanity , lies , and misdirection to be put forth from their conservative guests insufficiently challenged and insufficiently called up , it legitimizes these as if they are remotely valid in front of the audience , thus creating an actual net conservative bias . ( thus , i challenge your explanation that they are in a sense counterbalances , as one has implicit right-bias [ by being insufficient in calling out right-wing lies , misinformation , misrepresentation , and propaganda ] , and the other is full-blown right-wing propaganda - as opposed to having a left-bias matched by a right-bias ] . i do n't think this is True for moderates who hate the obvious bias of fox news but also ca n't watch msnbc/cnn due to the spin and omission of key details . if i understand your argument correctly then cable news is in aggregate not biased to "" the left "" , however , for that to be True on the micro/individual scale each cable news viewer ( god have mercy ) would need to watch the same stories on each network . the reality of the situation is that most people consume media only from the left or right , leaving them with a left or right wing bias . the terms "" liberal bias "" and "" conservative bias "" imply that public policy discussion can reduced to a single dimension . limiting your cmv to "" cable "" news only , because if you included the broadcasts as well your argument is even weaker than it already is . yes , fox has more viewers/better raitings but take a closer look at every anchor every program ... does cnn/msnbc have any non far left anchors/programs the way fox has say shepherd smith ( as anti-trump as it gets ) ? just because fox news is better at partisanship does n't mean far-left bias is not rampant in every other major news organization . i 'm not going to defend fox news because it definitely made the situation far worse in every which direction , but that does not mean there was no bias before . the fundamental "" problem "" if you look in to is that journalists are very liberal as a group for a variety of reasons , largely personality driven . so you have a group that really likes fighting "" the man "" ( it 's the sort of attitude that really gets you pumped up for journalism ) , but it also has a survivorship bias : by the time you 're making decisions about what the nation at large or even a big city gets to see , you are the man yourself . so we have a heavily liberal leaning ( in private lives ) group of upper middle class people who report the news at large . professionalism is one thing , and lots of people do manage it , but how could you possibly expect a group representing maybe 5 % of the us population ( upper middle class democrat ) to not have any sort of slant no matter how hard they tried ? of course the problem that fox brought to the party that they thought that they would balance 80 % of the media having a +25 democrat bias by being a 20 % with +100 republican bias . , but in reality what happened is that fox made it "" ok "" to be obviously biased , and the counter reaction basically turned a mild bias in to a seesaw of stupidity . but that does n't change the fact that 93 % democratic members of the upper middle class constitute the heart of the media , and they probably could n't represent the country even if they tried their hardest . i do n't know much about cable news , but i want to challenge this statement : by comparison , cable news shows hosted by rachel maddow and sean hannity ( two of the most watched cable news shows ) get in the 3-4 million weekly viewer range ."

9tv7j9,"the most effective means of prison reform would be the decriminalization/legalization of all drugs/narcotics to preface : i 've never used any illegal drugs/narcotics . i 'm coming at this from a fairly fiscal standpoint . as of 2018 46.1 % of those incarcerated in the federal prison system ( 1 or more years imprisoned/sentenced ) are there due to drug offenses . additionally , the average cost of imprisonment in the federal systems costs $ 36,299.25 a year ( fy17 ) . these two statistics together mean that , just at the federal level , we spend $ 2,838,383,554.5 on their incarceration alone . and these are all without even touching on individual state expenditure where some states pay as high as $ 69,355 per year ( fy2015 ) to keep individuals incarcerated . through the decriminalization/legalization of these drugs we would be saving money that could be funneled toward much more beneficial systems ( education , science & technology , other federal agencies ) or which could be used to help with further prison reform ( rehabilitation , reintegration of parole/releasees , etc. ) . the "" war on drugs "" does n't make sense to me from the standpoint of either political party whereas republicans claim to be fiscally conservative yet push for a policy of deterrence when it comes to drug crimes and democrats only take minor steps towards partial drug policy reform ( legalization of cannabis in some states as an example ) . i 'd love to hear your thoughts on this matter and what views you all hold .","with the criminal system freed from having to care for so many drug addicts , it will be able to focus more attention and funding on reform . the united states has one of the most brutally punishing jail systems , and this is due to design . the step of moving from a system of punition to a system of reform will address the largest remaining problem with our jail system . once someone is introduced to our jail system , they face a society which forces them into the outskirts of society and offers them very little in the way of paths back to honest living . but at that point you kind of want them in prison . you are completely off base in thinking that these people would otherwise just set up a legal drug shop to sell their wares . so what you ’re saying kinda sounds like this : “ make drugs legal to save money ” . roting your flesh , stoping your heart , completely altering the way your brain functions in a permanent way , death , etc . cannabis can be sold without much control because it 's pretty harmless , but most other drugs are n't , hell the legal drugs like alcohol and cigarettes cause more deaths in a week than cannabis causes in a year . that 's a hail mary tactic of trying to reform something that is more complex than simply "" legalizing drugs "" . fact is , drug charges may have gotten someone into a facility ( prison , state , local ) but a big root of the problem is a lot of these come from places where economic growth is little to none and cultural systems perpetuate involvement in illegal narcotics . for example , someone growing up in this environment is more likely to use illegal substances to self-medicate or to sell for financial gain . by making crimes legal , sure you can reduce the prison population , but people will still commit those acts . and prisons should also have many more workplaces to make it possible to change the attitude to work of the prisoners , and teach them manual skills . the government is corrupted and so favours those who build and own those prisons . it 's just that the drugs may of been the easiest to get them into the prison for . do you know what addiction typically does to a brain ? they can not control themselves and will eventually do anything to get a fix , almost inevitably leading to real crimes that would also land them in prison . legalizing all drugs does n't stop the problem ; it just changes the process . those in prison for narcotic posession are often there because they commited crimes and were then found to be in posession of drugs . if said decriminalization of all drugs happened , the use of these extreme drugs will not only skyrocket but the exposure it will have on children which in turn will severely affect their development if they do come in contact with them . the statistic you cite , is mostly people who are incarcerated for distributing or crimes related to drugs . the vast majority of prisoners are at the state level . nine states have more inmates in private prisons than the whole of the federal system . shutting down all private prisons would set the incentives to reform not just the entire legal system but all of society . or bringing back corporal and capital punishment for drug crimes . the prison guard unions are among the largest in the us , california is an example . i remember the article stating that if there was Truely a prison state in the world it has to be the us . the premise being instead of prisons , medical facilities are set up . people are n't over-incarcerated just because of drug laws . they 're over incarcerated because the prisons make profit based on how many inmates they have . legalising drugs would be a huge step in the right direction , but i 'm sure the police forces would find some new crime to overpolice in order to keep the private prison occupancy rates up . take out the minimum occupancy clauses for private prisons , then abolish the notion of a private prison in the first place , and legalise narcotics , and you 'd have made a good headway to leaving the top spot in terms of incarcerated populace . the number of drug related offenses i see come in are noting in comparison to all the other crime i see come in . if you make murder legal the # of murderers in prison would drop to 0 % too it ’s self explanatory as to why that is bad . it ’s patching up the problem with a band-aid , not fixing it . i realize that your argument revolves around the cost aspect , but i thought i ’d give my argument . it 'd help , but the most effective prison reform would be to get rid of prison entirely and switch to a policy that gave you a slap on the wrist for small/first offenses , and a quick , streamlined , humane death for repeated/severe offenses . that would be a good start , but it would n't change many of the mandatory minimum sentencing laws that are in place for more than just drug offenses . but it also depends on what kind of prison reform you 're talking about . if you want to reduce prison populations , then legalising drugs is a good start . but it wo n't help prison conditions , wo n't get rid of for profit prisons , and wo n't fix the disenfranchisement of felons . i 'm in my mid 30 's now but in my late teens and early 20 's i did a lot of different drugs including speed and crystal meth . those drugs destroy a lot of lives regardless of whether or not the people using them enter the criminal justice system . heroin is nearly the same drug as morphine ( in fact , it was made to be a more potent version of morphine , so that medical professionals did n't use as much ... since "" not as much is needed "" that made it "" less addictive "" , but clearly that did n't work out ) . - some laws give the police dept a financial incentive to seize money . here ’s fiverthirtyeight arguing in 2015 that you ’re probably talking about a 16 % reduction in prison populations if you were to drop all drug charges . the most effective means of prison reform is the realization that correctional facilities are meant to correct peoples ' defective characteristics that have prevented them from being members of society . if i were in charge i would split criminals into two categories , those that can be rehabilitated or are eventually getting out , and those that are pure evil . the pure evil ones can just stay in the same facilities we have now . i have been to prison three times ( state , not federal ) on multiple felony counts ranging from burglary to vehicle theft , and have been incarcerated 10 times in total . i do agree with the decriminalization of narcotics under the arguement that the addicts who commit crime to support their habit will eventually face charges regardless . however , i would understand someone arguing that putting that person in jail would stop them from possibly committing future crime to feed their habit , but in my experience jail or prison puts someone who might be a petty thief into a place where they literally learn to be a better criminal . i went to jail for the first time for stealing a video game from target , and while there i learned about drilling locks , breaking into cars , and cultivated relationships with like minded individuals . the whole situation is murky water , and i can understand viewpoints from both sides . i do see drug addiction as a disease that needs rehabilitation , and i believe jail or prison should do more for rehabilitating a person instead of punishing everybody the same regardless of the crime . or are you also expecting the retroactive ruling that all drug related offensive get people out of prison which counts as the reform ? my brother was on hard drugs for 20 years and did a couple multi-year prison terms , but never for actual drug possession . many others in the slam were there for murder , theft or domestic violence - all related to their drug habit . he told me there was almost nobody in the whole state prison who was there for anything other than crimes related to an addiction . but i dont think that the legalization of all drugs is the right thing to do . but the legalization is a way to say that the drug abuse is something socially acceptable , and i dont see how thats good when refering to drugs like heroin . problem is , the state is mandated to provide a certain number of prisoners for the privately run prisons in the us . it 's literally not profitable for the government to imprison less people as they would have to pay fines to those companies who own the prisons . to end mass incarceration , we need to fundamentally change our attitude toward violent crime . mass incarceration is primarily the result of more violent crime being reported/discovered , leading to arrest , and leading to prosecution for a longer period of time than ever before . point # 1 here is that most incarcerated americans reside in state prisons , not federal prisons . while many commentators are focusing on the more general aspects of prison reform and the justice system , i believe a more important point has been looked over , the fact that legalizing drugs , especially serious narcotics like heroin or cocaine for example is a bad idea , legally and morally . the first thing is that legalization would lead to increased use , and while legalizing it would promote certain reforms that would increase the safety of heavy drug use , the increased availability would offset the harm done . i do n't think i need to argue that drug use ( and by this i mean heroin and cocaine , not marijuana or other "" light "" drugs ) is bad . it has been proven to cause severe health problems , it can drive happy and successful people to ruin , it causes thousands of deaths , and makes life worse for everyone . as someone who is from an area severely affected by americas opioid crisis , legalizing drugs to promote prison reform would be like legalizing murder to lower incarceration rates ; it technically is True , but would only worsen the actual underlying issue . in the end , you would still have that same crime problem , except the prisons are n't filled with drug offenders , they are filled with "" violent , dangerous junkies "" convicted of burglary or assault or some such . for profit prisons are a thing , and until they get regulated out of business all of the prison reform that is pushed through wo n't do a damn bit of good . i agree with the premise that decriminalizing drugs will lessen jail sentences , but that isnt the core of the problem . i do n't know if you could consider it prison reform by simply making things that are illegal legal . to truly reform we need to alter our thoughts on criminals and their treatment in prison . legalizing possession is one thing , i do n't think we should imprison drug users , it helps no one besides the prison industry . selling on the other hand , definitely needs to remain illegal for a lot of drugs . let 's just go with heroin , if that was legal to sell , you can bet companies would do anything to get people hooked . i 'd much rather have weed legal to sell , and have alcohol and tobacco completely banned . prison reform usually refers to the conditions and techniques inside the prison to rehabilitate the prisoners and transition them back into society . if we legalize all drugs perhaps they could be used alongside traditional therapies to rehabilitate prisoners and change their minds about their place in society , the world and the universe . additionally , the government could put taxes on these drugs as to further increase the money they take in that can go towards better stuff . that would n't strictly speaking be prison reform , but i definitely agree it 's the best option . most people are in state prisons , and most of them are not there for drugs . one of the reasons why drug charges carry heavy sentences is because they ’re pushed for at a local level . arguing that the actual addicts should be lenient is one thing , but acting as though the drugs are n’t banned for legitimate reasons undercuts why they ’re banned in the first place . but overall this is n’t as top down as you think . these initiatives started at local levels to remove the dealers from communities because they caused horrible damage to families . the premise being instead of prisons , medical facilities are set up . republicans claim to be fiscally conservative yet push for a policy of deterrence when it comes to drug crimes of course , at first , it was a sham supported by republican politicians for shady reasons , such as reducing the amount of jobless people on the streets making employment percentages look greater , but much has changed since then , and , like democrats , the majority of republicans are all for drug reform , as well as rehabilitation instead of incarceration when it comes to nonviolent crimes in general . i know this article is a tad bit outdated , but this has been a positive trend among republicans for a decent time now , because , obviously , it is a positive change in a fiscal standpoint . otherwise , as someone who is quite libertarian in a handful of opinions , i have to agree with this being a positive change , but , like what is said in the article , a change difficult to execute not because of conflicting party opinions , but for other corrupt reasons . giving unnecessary infractions to lengthen an inmates jail time and fining the state for not reaching the inmate population quota in their corporate run prisons . i would ask you to define what drugs you are refering to . however if legislation punished distribution but not consumption this point is mute . incarceration costs are a small fraction of the cost of the futile and ridiculous war on drugs . this has nothing to do with prison reform , it has to do with legal crime reform ."
9tugi8,"if you are not a potential swing voter you are not a patriot if you only ever voted for candidates from a single party and can not fathom ever voting for candidates from the other , you are putting your party and its brand above country . voters control the direction of the country by putting one or the other party in charge . by making your vote guaranteed you relinquish that power , allowing party elites to craft whatever policies are in their interests as long as they are just nominally aligned with party brand . parties are not stable at all . democrats are a lot more right-leaning in terms of economy and foreign policy than they were in the 70s and 80s and republicans lost any sense of fiscal responsibility , which used to be one of its core principles . to a party line voter these swings go unnoticed because they are focused on brand rather than policy . but policies are made into laws not brands . so if you are not willing to hear out the opposing party 's candidate or maybe even vote for him or her , you are putting preservation of your identity above responsibility for your country . your vote almost does not matter and you are not a patriot . & #x200b ;","who you choose to vote for has nothing to do with patriotism . the two parties are very different from each other in many ways , and so expecting someone to vote for a party that does not represent their point of view kind of misses the point of democracy . further , if you want to influence a party 's overall leaning , that 's what primaries are for . so no , just because someone is loyal to one party over another does not make them unpatriotic . if by “ potential swing voter ” you mean having the capacity to eventually cross party lines in some hypothetical future election , i ’d tend to agree . but that does n’t necessarily hold True for every individual election . for example , if i regard climate change as the biggest threat to humanity , i do n’t really care what any individual republican has to say on the matter . despite all the rhetoric from people like jeff flake and ben sasse , when it comes to their votes , they do whatever the rest of the gop does . murkowski and mccain occasionally crossed party lines , on very specific votes , but as a rule , getting anything done on climate change requires the gop to be as weak as possible . even if my specific state or district happens to have an extremely pro-science gop candidate , they will face immense pressure to vote with their fellow science deniers as a bloc . in the face of such a threat , if you ’re a single-issue voter , even the most corrupt and inept d is a safer bet than literally any r , and there is no need to take a whole-candidate approach . even if i know i 'll vote for the democrat in the general election pretty much regardless of who it is , i can still control the direction of the country during the primary process . i 'm not sure i follow , if i think things that are central to a parties message are harmful to the country they just would n't be an option to me unless they changed thier platform significantly . you can vote on principals and never vote for a given party . just voting increases your district 's voter percentage and has a tangible benefit to your local community . i can try to change the dems in the primaries but after that what can a person do . unless you know an independent is strong , not voting for your party kind of helps the other which you like even less . also i vote based on a lot of issues , so if my candidate supports something i do n't like , chances are that the other person is worse for me so i usually do n't swing . i am more likely to swing at the local level though . i would swing if my candidate was a pedophile/assaulter ( moore ) or something . i do n't understand people who wo n't swing even then . certainly there are people that only vote party line , but many people ( including me ) vote straight ticket not because of any particular loyalty to the party in question , but because our views align entirely with one party over the other . just because someone votes entirely republican or democrat does n't mean they 're doing so because they have any loyalty to one or the other party . ok ... sure , if in 40 years the platforms have changed significantly , i might vote republican . i do n't think that makes me a swing voter . i vote on a party line because i understand the party platforms . if the party platforms change , my vote might change also . in the meantime , when a candidate chooses to identify themselves with the republican party , they are saying that they are generally going to support the current republican platform ."
9tu39r,"political campaigning is pointless has political campaigning ever changed anyone 's view ? if someone is going to vote for the republican party , a bunch of democrats knocking at their door will not change that . this is particularly True for referendums in ireland . there were referendums on gay marriage and abortion . people know how they feel about these issues , there was no point in campaigning . a conservative catholic will not support gay marriage or abortion , campaigning has no hope of changing that . a lot of time , money and effort would be savrd if voters were left to their own devices and did n't have the views of others forced upon them . i 'll be interested to hear if anyone has ever changed their view as a result of political campaigning .","someone who opposes abortion does not automatically know how various specific candidates / parties stand on the issue or how particular bills / ballot proposals affect that policy area . and then , of course , there are more niche issues that most people do n't actually know much about -- a wonky new issue that has n't already been in the national agenda for decades , that affects people but they do n't really understand why yet ( think net neutrality , which is kind of a big deal but most people had never heard of until recently ) . on new issues like these where people 's views are not already crystallized , campaigning and messaging can powerfully shape opinion formation . political campaigning is a lot more than just door to door . fliers , advertisements , door to door , rallies , etc. are all forms of campaigning . campaigning really tries to accomplish two things , advertise the candidate 's agenda , and energize the base . the first part kind of includes changing the minds of voters . the political landscape of today is definitely .... divisive to say the least , but in normal political discourse , you could absolutely change someone 's mind . running negative campaignings against your opponent is a good example . many voters may have supported trump 's policies , but his sexual assault allegations that were brought to light ( and heavily campaigned against by democrats ) definitely either reduced republican turnout and/or may have made people support another candidate . but campaigning does ( should ) provide information to the public about their policies and intentions if elected . if this information was not previously known or made easily aware , then it absolutely changes minds and influences decisions . your example of gay marriage or abortion is a bit of a strawman . those are pretty divisive issues where yes , most people have made up their mind . issues like gay marriage and abortion are very powerful motivators and really only have 2 sides , so people take a hard stance . the other really important thing campaigning does is energize the base and increase voter turn out . the ability to energize the base can absolutely shift the outcome of the election since so few people vote . positive campaigns show all the good that the constituents can see if they vote for someone , and negative ones highlight what happens if the other person wins . those can be powerful motivators and get people out to vote , potentially even shifting a seat to a new party . canvassing typically involves democrats knocking on the doors of democrats to remind them to vote . campaigning rarely changes anyone 's views , and it seems like there is very little than can . for the most part it seems like political campaigning , especially in the 2018 midterm cycle , has been focused on recently more than changing who people are going to vote for is getting people on their side to vote in the first place ( which i personally think is pathetic that getting people to vote requires so much effort ) . if through campaigning you can excite and energize another one or two percent to vote , that can make the difference in tight elections . persuasion is a factor for a lot of issues , but on tightly divided issues campaigning is mostly about convincing additional voters to show up . you get people to show up by talking to them , convincing them that this election really matters , and showing them how easy it is to vote . both sides spend a lot of resources on this because the marginal extra percent of voters really can make a difference ."
9tptpg,"the news should be split into two types of channels ; news and debate . in my opinion , the current format of news delivery is a very inefficient and confusing way to not only put out information but to also put it in an understandable and reasonable way . many networks have the 2-5 person panels right after delivering the news where they debate the issue usually talking over each other in a way that ends up unintelligible . i believe that there should be one set of channels that are strictly fact-based news where they give the details , facts , and figures and do their best to not voice their opinions on the matter . ( ex : at 05:45 pst iraq sent a force of around 5,000 soldiers into syria . al-assad put out this statement . currently , there is no statement from the white house on this issue ) the other set of channels ( can be run by the same companies ) is the actual 1v1 or panel discussions about that news and the pros and cons of each side of the issue . the main reason i think the current type of "" person telling the news is also debating it "" style is that they are arguing their opinion and it 's sometimes difficult for some to see where the facts end and the opinions begin when it 's not clearly defined .","climate change is real but news still continue to hold debates between cc deniers and cc advocates . objective news reporter would stop to give equalbspace to both sides and admid cc is real . there cand be debates how drastic measures are needed to fight climate change instead of debates is it real . i would love a channel that is just dedicated to face based news without all the opinion . unfortunately , what you have described above has already been done by cnn and well ... the strictly fact-based news side of it has pretty much failed to a certain extent . in today 's world , it 's not going to generate as much viewership and therefore , as much advertising dollars , as a tv channel should ideally generate . once upon a time , the current hln network was known as cnn2 and then headline news . for years , it was the trusty place that i and anyone else could rely on 24 hours a day for 30 minutes of just news and no chatter and screaming of opinions . then one day , cnn decided to change things at headline news and create evening programming focused more on opinion and found that it generated more viewership and more advertising dollars for itself . since then , cnn has rebranded headline news as hln and kept the evening debate/opinion format because it still generates the viewership and advertising dollars that networks crave . it 's much more entertaining to mix in opinion during or right after the reporting . the problem is that the very choice of what stories to cover and what facts to emphasize are themselves the issue . imagine someone had a news station where they just simply repeated all of the crimes committed by immigrants ."
9tpsin,"if the goal is to liberalize and secularize countries like egypt and saudi arabia the west should not rush to isolate but rather slowly push them that way . ill preface this by saying i do believe one of the goals for western nations is to champion and spread liberalism and democracy around the globe . it 's why they complain about human right abuses or fraudulent elections . they might sometimes have a round about way of doing that but they do believe liberalism is the superior ideology i have a hard time understanding what people think isolating countries egypt and saudi arabia for massacres and assassinations will accomplish . i think it 's much more likely that these countries will turn into radical islamic strongholds at even greater levels than what people think they are now if the west aims to economically isolate them . i find it nearly impossible to see them turning into secular liberal democracies from economic sanctions and international isolation . on some level i would like to envision them as finding the same path to democracy as south korea . even though for a long time after the korean war south korea was basically a military dictatorship or a sham democracy countries like the united states continued to use their influence to support democratic liberalization . obviously south korea is still not perfect but to get to where it is from where it was imo was in part because of western liberal influence . if say the united states had moved to isolate south korea after it committed atrocities against it own people i think south korea would have had a harder time liberalizing . even in a country like tunisia where liberalism did find some success from the arab spring we can see islamist parties gaining huge amounts of support . in egypt after their little experiment with democracy we saw islamist parties gain huge amounts of support . we dont want these countries to be tipped over . we want them to be pushed to liberalism and secularism though economic integration , cultural mixing and diplomatic pressure . admittedly . . i am probably ignorant on south korea 's path to democracy as well as details about what went on in egypt and tunisia during the arab spring . feel free to provide me with any knowledge you think in should have .","liberalization and the idea of democracy has to come from individuals thinking for themselves and establishing it , and if we in the us try and tell people how to do that , then they will inevitably rebel . gently pushing a country towards democracy is difficult if the general population hates us and everything it stands for . those things must change on a cultural level , and that sometimes means letting the country eat it 's own crap for a few years , starting a short war or sanctions ."

9tjnvn,"the claim "" everyone is a little racist "" is disingenuous and is used to justify one 's own racism . based on my personal experience both on and offline most people seem to accept the claim that "" everyone is a little racist "" . i have trouble accepting this view and would like to hear arguements as to why this is a valid claim to make . firstly i would like to point out that there 's absolutely no such thing as being "" a little racist "" in the sense that there is a kind of racism that one can be excused for . racism is racism wether you do it once a month or once a day . now , you can say that not all expressions of racism is equal which i definitely agree with . peacefully protesting in the streets against one race is n't as morally reprehensible as going out and murdering people of a specific race . so in that sense i agree that racism has gradations . as for my main belief : i believe that the claim "" everyone is a little racist "" is 1 ) a baseless accusation and 2 ) used by people to justify their own racism . basically i believe the phrase is implicitly stating that "" if everyone is racist then me being a "" little "" racist is n't as bad . "" now , one could argue that people believe this for other reasons . to that i 'll agree but those reasons have n't been made clear to me in any way shape or form . for my view to be changed i would like a legitimate basis ( i.e. jounrals , research studies , scientific data ) for this aforementioned claim . i would like to know how someone can confidently know the inner thoughts and feelings of every human being to have ever existed and accuse them of racism .","very few people are "" racists "" but everyone holds "" racist "" opinions , if by racism you mean prejudice against ethnicities . on the other hand , many "" racists "" do n't think they have racist opinions . there is a song by avenue q called “ everyone is a little bit racist ” , would definitely be worth listening to . in summary it explains that people do a lot of little things and are predjudiced in different ways besides what we commonly view as racist e.g. finding it harder to get a taxi vs. calling someone the n word . i think the claim is better used as a reminder that we all hold prejudices and need to be aware of them . i do n't consider myself racist and would never discriminate against someone for the color of their skin , but i took a few implicit association tests and they found bias against people that look different than me . some people may very well use the phrase ' everyone is a little bit racist ' as an excuse for them not working on improving their own issues with racism . if i had attribute ' x ' it would make me a bad person i am not a bad person for many other reasons that makes it difficult for them to improve - because the first step is to admit that they do have ( at least a little bit ) of that attribute . that 's the power of the truism ' everyone is a little bit racist ' . that is n't surprising - everyone has a little bit of attribute ' x ' . however you say that the levels of ' x ' in my life are making other people 's lives worse let 's look at those examples to see if that 's True now they may still stay in denial and find excuses for those exact examples ... but that truism has overcome the initial hurdle , so has been been useful . if your conversation with them is limited to ' you are racist ' then your conversation would be limited to steps 1 & 2 above and be entirely useless . i also got an email from someone who said they were nigerian and had an investment opportunity about the bank of nigeria - and i deleted it instantly without reading more . that 's the perfect example of racism . simply because they said they were nigerian ... i chose not to read the email further . so racism is something that appears everywhere ... even in people who do n't fit the normal idea of ' racist ' . if someone sees something that confirms his bias about a race , how many times does it have to happen before he can consider it a theme amongst that race ? if the answer is never , and everyone deserves to be judged individually then the second you assume it 's a an activity that a particular race is involved in you 're racist - or at least biased . what about people of a race that basically claim to be an ambassador of that race and say , "" we ( insert race ) do this , or we believe that "" ? if all this qualifies as racism , then everyone is racist , but it just depends if they are malicious or not . if i was a malicious racist , i do n't think i 'd care if i could justify my racism . i feel like that 's meant as a "" everyone has a degree of irrational bias "" , which to me is not an excuse but a warning to be aware of one 's own and not let oneself be guided by it . imo it 's not that everyone is a little racist , racism is very specific . it 's part of our social behaviour to draw conclusions about people , it 's part of a process to figure out where strangers stand when you do n't know them well enough . some get right out mad and claim that everyone from a certain neighbouring town beat their wives because their team won the football match last week . and the most sensible will know that just because there are a few domestic abuse cases does n't mean everyone in the whole town do it . in another usage , "" racist "" is about being a passive individual in a society that promotes a racial hierarchy . for example , not moving to a black neighborhood because you think it has worse schools is n't explicitly a racist action , since it 's mediated by several other factors , like the history of black discrimination in housing/education , which leads to worse schools . and in the us context , it promotes white supremacy because it perpetuates a system where white people can continue to be the most successful . but it is True that almost everyone perpetuates the current racial power structure — often through mediated factors ( like housing decisions ) in which racial preference exists . from the point of view of someone who is a minority in america , someone who supports equal rights for all races ( as well as other suppressed groups , lbtq , feminists , etc ) , and someone who attempts to be as open-minded as reasonably possible , i tend to get some racist thoughts now and again . i do n't think that "" everyone 's a little racist "" should ever justify conscious or unconscious racism , that 's a poor argument for abhorrent behavior . i 'm okay with ( and actually really enjoy ) racist comedy so long as it stays as comedy , but i really do n't tolerate real world discrimination . so basically even though i represent a person who does n't support racist behavior at all , i sometimes am a little racist with my first impression of someone , but i recognize it 's bad and unfounded behavior . that being said , saying that "" everyone 's a little racist "" is stupid , and only serves to defend ones own racism . for example i 'm walking down the street an i see four black guys wearing certain colors i 'm crossing the street . same could be said about a black man walking towards a group of white trash looking guys . to me everyone is prejudice , which i think people confuse with racism . do i think more of it is just prejudice based on circumstance yeah . i think the point to this statement is n’t that everyone support systematic racism but that we all subconscious biases that if we do n’t recognize could be harmful to minorities of any group , not even specific to racism . making this statement "" is disingenuous and is used to justify one 's own racism . "" i do n't think everyone is racist , but i do think a large portion of us are prejudice . some years back , talking about the difference between prejudice and discrimination . the idea was that prejudice is used to define preconceptions about someone belonging to a particular group . for example , if someone sees an indian guy running a 7/11 and has have some thought about how he 's indian , so he is n't as trustworthy as a white shop owner . if we focus on the former ( prejudice ) i think it 's safe to assume that everyone has prejudicial thoughts sometimes , even if they do n't act on them . the question , i think , comes down to whether reflexive , unintentional prejudiced thoughts count . for example , the difference between someone seeing the indian guy and thinking he 's untrustworthy , but then going "" what a ridiculous thought that was . versus having the thought and thinking "" yeah , those indian guys . "" if reflexive thoughts count , i think it 'd be hard to believe no one has those thoughts . as for the ill intent you describe behind using the phrase "" everyone is a little racist , "" i 'd ask : what support do you have for believing this to be the case ? minor levels of racism , that does n't hurt other people , should be ignored or be somewhat acceptable . "" minor level racism "" being defined as thoughts not being acted upon or publicly spoken about . what makes someone racist is how they choose to act on those prejudices . we all do - and claiming that we are above such things is exactly how unexamined implicit biases ( unconscious racism ) turn into racist acts ( overt racism , which i think you might have limited your definition to . ) i just know my own biases and racism wo n't go away because i ignore them - and that i ca n't defeat racism in our society until i fight it in myself . so i personally do think everyone is a little racist , but i also think racism is horrible and unjustified . let me explain what it is then i mean when i say "" everyone is a little racist "" . i think in order to not be racist , you have to acknowledge that racism to an extent is built into your brain . it does n't mean that it makes racism excusable , however small . "" everyone 's a little bit racist "" is a reminder of that , and to be open to the possibility that something that you 've done might have elements of racism that you never intended or were even aware of . "" i am ( insert minority ) i am not racist . "" these are things racist tell themselves to justify that they are not racist . self-awareness of our flaws and prejudices allow us to grow beyond them , complacency sets in when we think we do not have any . if a hypothetical racist held racist beliefs , and never expressed that racism and had never affected any other human being , or tried to promote his beliefs to others , would you still denounce this person ? in any situation , the first thought that pops into your head is what everything external ( culture , religion , family , etc. ) has taught you . the thoughts you have in response to that are what make you who you are . and we all do it , it 's just a matter of acknowledging that the fault for the judgement lies with you and that its your responsibilty to grow from it . those who do n't acknowledge their unfair views never grow . i have plenty of friends who would consider themselves "" woke "" but do in fact have their own issues and make their own judgements . i do n't think that anyone is going to go out and make a test proving each and every person is proven racist , but to say that not everyone has a little prejudice about them is ridiculous . i 've known black people who are just as racist as the small town i 'm from , however i 've also met people who would never consider race when talking to another person ; i believe that prejudice comes from the human need to be better than one another . in other words , it is natural to develop simplistic explanations for your anecdotal experiences , and it requires logic to see above them . every class of people has plenty of racists , although not everyone in every class is racist . i propose that race is not a skin color thing . people will divide into groups however they can , and if one group looks a bit more irish and one group looks a bit more english ( not to mention any differences in dress , dialect , etc ) , that 's enough to develop racism for . not in the sense of whether it 's okay to hate everyone with a certain skin color , but in the sense of addressing the motive of the arguer . the upper , middle , and working classes all have thoughts about each other . the muslims in pakistan have thoughts about the hindus in india . "" everyone is a little bit racist "" is the answer to the ridiculous "" i do n't see race "" trope . everyone sees race ( or group ) , and most people have some automatic thought about that group . on some level i think it 's a survival strategy that developed in our brain thousands of years ago . i always took it to mean ' we all have unconscious biases about certain ethnic/religious/gender groups and we need to acknowledge that to overcome them , ' i do n't that people saying it are trying to excuse their own racism , or that they 're trying to take you to task with a baseless accusation . everyone pre judges people but not everyone acts upon those prejudices . i think it ’s like everyone is a little sexist , if you see a man walking down the street in a skirt you ’ll think it ’s weird and note it because he ’s not a girl . in some way you ’ll acknowledge it because it ’s not / normal / for men to wear skirts . so consciously or unconsciously you determine it ’s out of place because it breaks your stereotype of a man , which is a little sexist . just like if you see a white person with dreadlocks or something stereotypical of another race you ’ll acknowledge it because they do n’t fit into the stereotype of their own race , and that ’s a little racist . everyone categorizes people into groups and stereotypes them , teenagers are rebellious , the elderly are senile , fat people are lazy , etc. it ’s part of human nature to want to categorize and label things to make them more predictable . i agree that the statement is used to excuse racist behavior , but i also think it ’s human nature and not everybody takes it upon themselves to actively break their stereotypes when they think of something that categorizes a group . i ca n't speak on behalf of people you 've met , but i think that "" everyone 's a little racist "" is generally intended to be the opposite of what you seem to be suggesting . i 'm not saying it originated there , but there is a song called "" everyone 's a little racist . "" in that context , "" everyones a little racist "" is a reminder to check your beliefs , remember that everyone is constantly learning about others , and even people with the best intentions may bring underlying assumptions to situations that are "" a little bit racist "" if you really dig into them . i think this claim is n’t really meant to say that everyone is racist in behavior , but that everyone has biases that are to an extent out of their control . for example , if you are alone in an elevator and a large black dude gets in and you feels a little anxiety and you want to clutch your purse tighter , that is your racist bias . however , since we have higher cognitive function than that , the lady wo n’t actually clutch her purse and the man will say hi . neither of these people are racist beyond the “ little bit racist ” that we all carry in our biases . the meaning of the “ everyone ’s a little bit racist ” statement is n’t meant to excuse racist behavior but to avoid punishing yourself for thought crimes . i think this statement is a defensive statement to being an accused racist based on someone else 's reaction to your preconceived notions - aka stereotyping . due to a few preconceived notions given by the enviornment people believed the man in front of them was an engineer when he was truly a lawyer . the filter you use to decide whether the though in your mind is where racism is born - in what way does the person process a stereotypical thought ? however , if you recognize that people 's mind is going to do what it wants ( bad thoughts cross everyone 's mind ) , you let it ride in order to give the person a fair shake - that 's not racist - even though the racist though passed through your head . everyone stereotypes \ - some just decide to see it as racism , when in reality they 're being humans simply do n't have the mental strength to hold back the thought . what ’s disingenuous is someone claiming their thoughts have never ever been affected by race . even if you feel guilty about it or diffuse your thoughts with reasoning , i feel like the tendency to assume things based on identity classifications is very natural for the brain to do . if you go by this definition ( which i do as the other one i 've seen is kinda loaded and inherently negative ) there 's no immediate negative connotation . most western people immediately assume this means white people being racist against another race . in the us , at least , there 's even an argument that only white people can be racist because of institutional racism ( another subject entirely ) . if you 're black in the us , no one ( including myself ) would ever suggest that it was racist to be proud of your heritage even if you 're talking race ( e.g. "" black power ! "" but if you 're white and you say "" white power "" or "" i 'm proud i 'm white "" - racist ( not so much your ethnicity ; you do n't hear people being accused of being racist by saying they 're proud of their irish heritage ) . i do n't see it as an excuse to be racist , but more of a reminder that we 're all human beings and race is out of our control . i have almost never seen the phrase used to justify one 's own racism . we agree , no racism is so "" little "" that it can be excused ( although it seems to me from context that you do understand perfectly well that there are , in fact , degrees of racism ) but the point of the quote is not to excuse it . well i suppose i have no proof that there are n't people out there with no prejudgements or biases regarding skin color , but i have yet to meet such a unicorn . if i grew up in kentucky , i ’d probably assume all young white kids are on meth and want to cut me . i disagree , i believe alot of the time saying that everybody is a little racist is often used as a call for people to be more aware of their inherent biases , only by paying attention to them can we overcome them . a more accurate statement is “ everyone has their own subjective unconscious bias towards certain groups of people ” but that would require everybody to understand what unconscious bias are and that ’s not happening any time soon . the difference is even though everybody has these bias is if you actually act on them or not . when bias manifest themselves outside your head into the real world that ’s when it becomes racism . you could have grown up liking one kind of pasta but hating the other even though they are both from the same dough just looking different . exposure to racism ( not against you ) is enough for someone to develop racial bias , just like how you know racism is bad simply because you have been taught it is bad . everyone is racist , in the sense that we all have prejudices we formed when we were young that do n't truly represent the people they 're about . racism is not a binary coin of racist vs not racist . the only thing we can truly do that is honest and productive is admit we 're racist , notice when we are , reflect on the implications of what we say & do , and change our views & belief 's accordingly . if you get caught out saying something prejudice , apologise and be your own prosecution , realign your values , and make a promise with yourself to not make the same mistake again . now imagine you have to pick between a complete stranger and someone who look like your father , who would you pick ? i know i see racism as being any form of hate against an ethnic group , but some people see racism in any sort of bias regarding people of other races . i would say it ’s just a bit biased , not at all racist . but still , a lot of people think this way about black people so , if you see this as racism , then a lot of people have a bit of racism in them . not trying to justify actual racism , just trying to find a reason why some people would say it ’s a thing for everyone . in fact people who think they are n't racist are less happy to change their subconscious biases because they have "" othered "" racists so wo n't accept they have similar issues to such monsters . it 's not mind reading , but it 's the closest we have for detecting implicit biases , such as racism . i know you say you 're a psych major ( as was i , and my partner currently in psych research ) , but i think you 'll have to explain how , despite the iat 's shortcomings , the iat ca n't detect race related biases . for an even simpler answer , can you think of one person you know who had never held a racist attitude or racist view ? specifically though , someone actually saying “ everyone is a little racist ” does n’t know what they ’re talking about and probably is likely trying to justify their own racist behavior . “ racism ” and “ racist ” as a word in today ’s world and media is going to elicit an idea that it ’s bad , it ’s wrong , and hey , it has to be because of history . hello , i know you ’re looking for citations and while i ’m too lazy to find them i just took a course called “ peace communications ” which can help alleviate some of your anxieties about the phrase “ everyone ’s a little bit racist ” . if you look to avenue q the musical , you will see that the namesake song is about accepting that we all have biases and move forward . she would not call herself racist , yet when a large black man steps onto the subway where she is one of the few other passengers late at night , she may clutch her purse tightly to her . in this example , we see that oftentimes racism is subtle and unthought of . the triumph and positive message that is intended with “ everyone ’s a little bit racist ” is that we should all strive to recognize our inner biases , because even if we outwardly claim to not have them we genetically and socially do . it is a True statement but it is also used to justify racism . for starters here , i 'd like to clarify that racism is not an act ; racism is a belief or system of beliefs that sees race as a hierarchy . people act in that belief in negative ways that some might call "" racist acts "" -- not because racism is an act , but that the acts themselves were motivated by racism . the difference between someone who is racist or not is that a racist acts on that bias , whereas a non racist at least tries not to . people have a preference towards strangers in which theyd rather be immersed , may be a better way of putting it . and it 's important to realize what your thinking when you 're immersed in strangers from a group which you do n't feel comfortable and ask yourself "" am i uncomfortable because i do n't like these people or am i uncomfortable because these people are n't what i am used to being around ? "" if it 's the former , i 'd call it racism . if it 's the latter i 'd call it recognition of ingroup bias . every person might not be full blown racist , but we have stereotypes in our head about the other person ’s race , which is a form of racism in itself . i have no doubt that people use this to justify racism , and i do n't agree with that , but we create stereotypes in our mind based on what we experience . based on the song of the same title everyone 's a little bit racist -- url -- from the broadway smash hit avenue q , ( definitely counts as research ) if you have ever laughed at a joke that singles out a different race , you are aware of the racist tropes that make those jokes funny . therefore , while you may not hate other races , you find their stereotypical shortcomings funny , which is a form of racism . i try my best but fully realize that i come with plenty of implicit biases , and i appreciate when people point them out to me ( whereas many people 's reaction is to get defensive ) . furthermore , youre clearly targeting a phrase known to mask a line of thinking , not an actual held opinion - youve completely neglected to mention the way culture instills banal racist ideas into people almost subconsciously . however , having implicit biases only means you 're at all racist if you act on those biases or make decisions based on them . i think what the claim is trying to convey is that everyone is capable of pattern recognition . i ’ve also worked in retail and 95 % of the scammers and thieves i ’ve encountered were black . so does concluding that a black customer is way more likely to scam or a hispanic customer is way more likely to be on welfare make me racist , when that is the unbroken pattern of my and fellow coworkers ’ experience ? regardless of if you want to or not your brain keeps track of people with similarities and creates stereotypes for them . your brain also does this with race regardless of if you want to or not . seriously though , if you can think of what a stereotypical native american looks like , that ’s technically racism , technically because you ’re grouping people without actually really knowing them and all of the bad traits your brain associates with said group is applied to that person . short version : your brain groups everyone you meet into groups , usually subconsciously , and attributes traits ( positive and negative ) to them , which technically is racist if you are serious about having this discussion in a constructive way , you would have to give a definition of what it means to "" be racist "" and "" not be racist "" , and what criteria would be necessary to place one in either category . that takes some time and careful thought to set appropriate boundaries . not as a way to justify racism , but to point out that even people who are not overtly racist often contribute to systemic problems and the oppression of marginalized people . a person may not consider themselves racist because they refuse to use the n word , but do they go out of their way to call out their friends or strangers who do ? if you want to demonstrate just how "" not racist "" you are , just walk through the ghetto at night . basically if you are afraid , you 're more likely to make hasty decisions which necessitate those ingrained efficiencies . so anytime you make a decision without consciously working through it , it is likely colored by your mental groups . on the other extreme it happens on the everyday decisions you do n't realize you make . maybe you had better feelings about males because the females fall into the "" more likely to take leave "" group . it 's entirely possible to make racist choices without being racist . if you intentionally do n't care about the consequences of your choices you are though . that being said , the difference between "" a little racist "" and "" racist "" is whether you are aware of your biases and whether you conpensate for them . "" a little racist "" steers a bit to the right to conpensate . it is even possible to be super racist , be aware of it and conpensate back to normality though i believe people like this to be very rare . pretending otherwise gives racists the opportunity to paint progressives as being in denial , and themselves as not racist but merely "" realistic "" . well liberals who constantly claim ( with 110 % smug ) to be fighting against racism always say they are going to flee to canada when things do n't go their way , despite the fact that mexico is warmer and much cheaper . i guess everyone is a litlle racist as in : everyone unconsciously has prejudices because they have either bad experiences or are used to a certain trusted group of people around them and are “ protective ” of their “ group ” "" everybody is a little racist "" is less about justifying one 's own racism and more about realizing that nobody is without bias , in some direction or another , and being aware of that makes it easier to not be ruled by that bias . i would never use that statement since it is used to justify one 's own rascism , however . i think people who claim to be race blind ( 0 % racist ) are deluding themselves that they float above or outside of society . anyway , i think you 're not being fair to those who point out that everybody is a bit racist . those people are simply acknowledging human prejudice as a fact of life which is , in my opinion , a good way to be on guard against racism in our own actions/thoughts . it is not a little known fact , everyone in the world is reasonably aware that white people have colonized so much of this world , and as a result of this , people of color have always been viewed as inferior . whether you 're aware or not , you are biased against people of color . i have had to accept that i grew up in a racist world , and that left me with racist opinions that i had to deconstruct and work against . when i say that everyone is racist , i am not trying to excuse my behavior . i am saying that we must be aware of ourselves , aware of the narratives we 're fed growing up about people of color , if we have any hope of breaking down these social structures . during times like these , if i call someone racist , i most likely am not angry . fighting racism has to be a constructive , learning experience for both sides if we want to get rid of the racist narratives in place . so please , moving forward , if you 're called racist , try not to take it personally . you need to recognize that everyone is a little racist , in the same way that everyone is a little bit attracted to the same sex ; everyone is a little bit closed minded ; everyone is a little bit selfish ; everyone is a little bit empathetic ; everyone is a little bit irrational . observationally , we have a much easier time differentiating these groups when they are visibly different as well . so take a cultural group that has been oppressed over time , like black people in america . they were kept as slaves partially because they were foreign and from a less developed land and could be kidnapped and held as slaves , but the biggest thing that made slavery possible was that it was easy for a human to identify a likely slave versus a free person because they looked different at a glance . if america used irish or germans as slaves it would be much harder to maintain that standard as long , it would be too easy for them to reintegrate because at first glance you would n't see their exclusion from your cultural group . because of this easy identification , these groups of people tend towards having similar experiences , even if they are under different circumstances , due to prejudices . so a free black man will be assumed to be a slave on first glance , and treated as such . this causes this visibly distinct group to tend towards sharing certain cultural elements . some of these cultural elements directly impact the experience of the entire group , so for instance , having been historically discriminated against , black people did n't inherit wealth , property or social status in the same way as white people might have . this does n't apply to every individual , but as a group , this is the general outcome . now this does n't yet claim that everyone is a little racist . the thing is people are really good at identifying patterns and making judgments based on incomplete information . the fact is , for instance , that black people as a group are , poorer , less educated , and more likely to commit crimes than white people . because it 's easy to differentiate at a glance a black person from a white person , we will categorically in our minds tend to subconsciously keep a running tally on what our experience will be like when we interact with a black person separate from what we expect when we interact with a white person . this might be benign , in expecting they speak differently , use different slang , or it might be a bit more insidious like expecting that they be poorer , less trustworthy , or are more likely to have grown up without a father figure . everyone invariably categorizes based on easily identifiable characteristics and assigns qualities to those categories of people . because of the fact that we can differentiate by race , we categorize by race implicitly . because we categorize by race , we have expectations based on race . because we have expectations that differ between races , we have prejudices that make us somewhat racist . not racist in a "" i think my race is superior "" way , but racist in a "" i think one race is different than another race "" because any difference will show some favoritism towards one way or the other . i think though that it 's important to recognize this , not to feel guilty about it , or to excuse it . it 's important to recognize this so that you are able to defeat those automatic biases , and challenge your prejudices . you are ignoring something that your categorical mind is doing behind the scenes , and you will not challenge those prejudices , because you deny they exist , and you will end up acting in a racist way . if you admit that , yeah , like everyone else , you have an opinion on how a black person is going to act that differs from how a white person is going to act , you can actively challenge yourself about whether your action is rational and unbiased or whether you 're just going to accept that implicit prejudice . the only way to not be racist is to not be able to differentiate people categorically based on race . but the reason we are racist is the same reason that we have different expectations of men and women , it 's the same reason we have different expectations of fat people and skinny people , it 's the same reason we have different expectations of gingers and people with souls , it 's the same reason we have different expectations between pitbulls and labs . we always prejudge someone before we get more information about them based on our assumptions gathered about the more general category that they belong to . we see a pitbull and we are more likely to worry that it is dangerous even though it might be the sweetest dog out there . we might see a lab and be less likely to worry that it 's dangerous even though it has been abused and made viscously aggressive . as we get more information , notice their behavior , mannerisms , we refine our thinking , but before then we prejudge them based on our knowledge of the category , and restrict it to within that category and hierarchy that we understand . we accept that a pitbull might be kind , but we do n't expect it to share the behaviors of a cat , or even a lab . though there 's certain behaviors that we consider dog behaviors that we think any dog can do , then there 's exceptions to that which we think any pitbull behave like , and then there 's exceptions that we think this individual pitbull might behave like . if we see a pitbull sharing behaviors that we have associated with a lab , we might think "" this pitbull ( definite , as opposed to a more indefinite ' pitbulls ' ) is acting like a lab ( indefinite , categorical association ) "" similarly , we think the same for people , like "" this white guy acts like he is black "" is a far easier conclusion to accept than "" white people from time to time share cultural elements that are traditionally accepted as a property of being black , and maybe we should consider these cultural elements a shared human cultural element , or change how we classify this to be based on location or occupation . "" but the same thing that makes us a bit racist is the thing that allows us to have some expectation on how any interaction is going to play out . if you go to china and you need help from someone and you do n't speak chinese , you might be happy to see a white person because you figure he 's more likely to speak english . but you have prejudged that because he is white , he is more likely to speak english . nothing keeps any other chinese person around from having learned english in the past , or even having grown up in an english speaking country . nothing keeps that white person from being from sweden and not knowing english . but you made a judgment based on incomplete information that took race into consideration . if we accept this , we can keep that those prejudices from being harmful . it 's not a system that is just based on race , it 's a system that we use all of the time to just get by in normal life , and thus , nobody gets to avoid it . instead , we live in a society where racial bias has been everpresent for as long as any of us have been alive , and many lifetimes before that ( because slavery , colonialism , tribalism , fear of the other , etc. ) its more helpful to think of racial bias as something that every human of thinking age has , because how could you not ? the vast majority of people are not “ out and proud ” racists ( ie “ a racist ” , yet absolutely everyone holds racial bias , whether they are aware of it or not . the fact that i am aware of having racial biases , and of living in a racist culture ( us ) , and put effort into not acting on that towards people of other races , does n’t innoculate me against slipping up and making a racist comment which makes someone else feel uncomfortable . i think a useful ( though imperfect ) frame of reference would be laziness . however , if you were n’t aware of just how often you engage in laziness , or aware of how laziness interferes with your life goals , it would be easy to justify the behavior which is problematic . i ’m not sure ill change your view here , but if someone says to you “ everyone is a little racist ” as a way to excuse some racist comment or view , that could be a nice “ in ” to do some education about ways in which racism is perpetuated perhaps ? however it 's not an excuse to justify people 's actions , any racist behaviour is and will always be wrong . i am a person of color living in america and while the outright racism here is bad , the microaggressions from coworkers and friends is sometimes a worse burden because i can not just write those people off . please point me to the person who has never harbored a thought that remotely resembled racism . even if you looked into it yourself and found it was True , smoking was physically safe , you would find your attitudes did n't match up right away . you did the same thing as a kid , and if you did it in a racist society , then you adopted attitudes you did n't know were wrong , but are indeed racist . the theory is that it 's impossible to find and unlearn every single prejudice that 's been imparted on you , thus , everyone is racist . i 've always considered this is a continuation of the fact that our brains categorize and generalize subconsciously all the time . we do this based on a million different factors like height , sex , body language , facial hair , skin color , clothing , style , vocal tone , etc , etc , etc . if all of your experiences with 6foot + men wearing hoodies with saggy pants and unkempt facial hair are negative or dangerous , then the moment you see someone filling that description your subconscious starts sending warning signals . this works with any and every conceivable factor and unfortunately can also include skin color . now obviously we have our conscious mind to attempt to counter those automatic responses from our subconscious . you ca n't simply shut off that automatic response from the subconscious though . you are requesting those presenting a counter argument to substantiate it with academic articles when you yourself wo n’t do the same . before answering this , i think it ’s important to define racism . do you subscribe to the view that racism is a system that seeks to oppress minorities or that it is simply prejudice ? if you subscribe to that view , then ipso facto everyone ( i.e. white people and people in power , regardless of race ) in the us is a racist . i understand that saying this can seem defeatist - if everyone is a racist and racism has always and will continue to exist , what ’s the point in doing anything about it ? however , i think it ’s important to realise that we ’re all complicit and that we are responsible to use whatever degree of influence and power we to challenge racism . we just try to catch ourselves when those thoughts pop up and correct them where as racists feed into them "" i have prejudices against other types of people but i do n't let that over shadow my principle values of being a decent human being and treating everyone i meet with an acceptable amount of respect because they are another human being . "" nobody is free from intrusive thoughts , prejudice thoughts and harsh judgements . if your internal monologue occasionally thinks racist things , that is infinitely different from vocalizing those thoughts and even more different from letting those thoughts dictate how you talk to and treat people . depending on the definition you use , simply noticing that someone is of a different race and/or treating them differently because of it could be considered “ racist ” . as a result of noting her race , i tried to more clearly articulate and slow down my speech to account for the language/cultural barrier between us . this example is definitionally racist , because i ’m treating someone differently based on their race . racism is inherent in each person regardless of their background , ethnicity , or perceived open mindedness . would n’t you assume you ’d have preconceived notions as to how northeastern italian americans act and some bias toward or against that behavior ? now you meet my wife who is a northeastern italian american and she does n’t exhibit any of those characteristic behaviors and it gives you a new sense of the population . so what we ’re talking about is often called implicit bias , racism without racists , or unconscious racism . in what ways is it meaningfully different from simply making negative assumptions about people based on their racial identity , which also seems to be a consequence of our more or less natural tendency to want to group people together and make sweeping generalizations about groups ? however what we do do is come up with concepts that explain the behaviors of most people within specific contexts . the problem is that you 're setting up a situation in which someone is rendered categorically racist ( in the "" you hate x people "" sense ) for anything they say or do that could possibly be consTrued as racist . the reason people get defensive is because they are not categorically hateful , and have a legitimate reason to dispute that implication . so when you say "" racism is racism no matter how much you do it "" , you come across as someone looking for any excuse to dismiss a viewpoint because of a racist implication . by the same token , how can you confidently know the inner thoughts and feelings of humans who you have consTrued as racist ? everybody 's a little racist because we 've evolved to survive on a savannah in tribal communities and members of different tribes are an unknown to us , and therefore a potential threat . unconscious bias ca n't be used to excuse intentional bigotry . there are infinate levels of pre conceived notions and learned behaviors that affect how we treat people differently . people use this phrase to explain a sort of inward racism that happens mostly in the subconscious . it 's an acknowledgement that racism is a kind of bias that 's impossible to eliminate completely , and that "" microaggressions "" are fractal . therefore , a reasonable amount of vigilance will always fall short in some way , and a reasonable person will always behave in a slightly racist manner instead of hamstringing himself or engaging in self-hate to "" compensate . "" what ’s called racism today does n’t need to be “ justified . ” for example , pretty much everyone is aware of disproportionate black crime and applies caution in their own subtle way , which is called racism . racial bias may begin in babies at six months , u of t research reveals i will concede that your position may be correct for infants under 3 months old . for someone to be 100 % racist free you would also need to test them in various situations , especially stressful ones . a truly 100 % racist free brain would probably also have some major cognitive impairments and be very low functioning . it would be almost impossible to have a functioning heuristic system and not have a single racial bias develop somewhere in your lifetime . so you are technically correct ( the best kind of correct ) that there may be very young infants and brain damaged people who are literally 0 % racist but assuming you are talking about the normal functioning population i would say it 's virtually impossible . people are also pretty good at overriding their assumptions for individuals , though , which is why they feel that they 're not , in fact , racist . it 's interesting to see how you 've set up your argument to your advantage by making the claim that a little racism is the same as full racism , yet are n't you doing the same thing that racists do by claiming that ? a little racist is full racist ... sounds a lot like the one drop rule . there are clearly different levels of racism , but you 're not allowing for that with the position you 're taking , even though it 's clear to everyone else replying to you because that 's the basis of most of their arguments . i agree with the explanation of your view , but i think what the point you are making a case against is more about prejudice and bias than actual racism . racial prejudice and bias are a lot more common than racism itself . right question - "" do you purposefully alter your behavior in a way that negatively impacts people of socioeconomic profiles that differ from yours ? "" even though i am white , i was discriminated against in the gentrified world because of my appearance , behavior , and speech patterns . if 3 month olds who ca n't even hold up their heads show some racial bias it suggests that there is some implicit bias we learn between being born and 3 months of age where we feel more affinity with people of our own race . they do n't know that they 're doing something wrong and there 's no malice of thought . they 're just thinking does this person look like the people who feed me and keep me happy . this leads to the conclusion that everyone 's a bit racist if you categorise that implicit affinity as racism . this seems a bit ridiculous though as a defense for the nazis and the kkk , or even that family member who says something that everyone else cringes at . they go far beyond the implicit bias of familiarity and into malicious action . whether out of ignorance ( they 're an adult and they have the opportunity to learn to overcome the biases ) or knowing full well the consequences of what they 're saying , they 're being racist . it matters whether you include malice of thought and action in your definition of racism . if having biases without malicious action makes you racist , it seems like we learn these early in life and "" everyone may be a bit racist "" . everyone is biased . this is something that i say not because it validates my racism , but because it is just factually wrong to state that nobody has bias at all towards different people . if we say that we do n't have some kind of bias then when we have these thoughts we do nothing to fix them , because we do n't recognize them . but if we recognize our biases when they appear , then we can work to correct them . i think the claim “ everyone is a little racist ” is definitely True . we are raised in a society where pretty much any form of social media or information are constantly influencing us and subconsciously implementing prejudice in our mind or way of thinking . perhaps the most easy and common example are stereotypes about each race , which in itself can be a form of “ little racism ” . we are raised through a society that already has predetermined sets of common beliefs and ideas about race , in which we inevitably pick up on - subconsciously or not and whether we like it or not . people call it racism because the meaning of racism has been diluted in our society . racism is good for survival , at least in the wild . i think that rather than "" everyone 's a little racist "" it should be "" everyone has their own implicit biases "" which is a lot less provocative and apologist , so people dont say it that way . the other circle represents racists beliefs about groups of people . the overlapping portion are generalizations one can make based on personal experience , but may come off as racist . for example : as a waitress i noticed i sold more seafood and lemonade to asians and more popcorn chicken and grape soda to black people . so if i started offering lemonade to asians and grape soda to black as suggestive selling , i could easily come off racist , but really i ’m upselling based off experience , or maybe we ’re all a little racist ? i do n't think i 've ever claimed seriously that "" everyone has a little bit of racism in them "" to anyone . but i do think most people have had a little bit of something at some point , not enough to be considered hate or actual racism and certainly not enough to justify racism . i totally agree that this idea used to justify explicit racism is bullshit . nobody should be able to get away with saying something wrong by diffusing the blame to everyone else as if it has equal footing . where i disagree is that in practice literally everyone enters regular situations with their own biases and some of those biases are based in race . there 's just simply no chance that you or anyone else has never once had a racist thought that you sort of agree with or do n't want to believe but still do . nobody is such an angel that they have no biases or prejudices . basically , the human brain is naturally programmed to think in groups , to classify any new stimulus into these groups instantly , without even "" consulting "" the conscious mind . what is possible though , is installing a conscious step in that process , to decide if the classification was accurate or even needed . everything we see , everyone we meet , every single stimulus you receive gets immediately put into a drawer in your brain that fits best . ( that 's also why you do a double take when encountering a stimulus that "" does n't fit "" , like a white person that maybe fits into your drawer of "" black culture "" perfectly , except for their skin color ) . in that sense , everyone is a little bit racist - we all instinctively categorize people into our own drawers , and one of these is "" you look different from me , this is the drawer for people like you , and it is labeled with everything i have ever heard about them "" . what is not racist , on the other hand , is being aware of the drawer , and consciously taking the person back out of that drawer and reconsidering . our brain works in drawers and boxes , and as long as you do n't lock them or glue them shut , you 're not racist . or how about we just say "" indian burn "" is just a little racist . everyone has biases , it 's fair to assume some of those biases are going to be around race , hence everyone is a little racist . it 's fine , its awkward , but as long as you are aware when you are like "" oops , little peep of racism snuck out , sorry "" like a fart in a quite conference room . heres a baby step to try and demonstrate how racism exists , although it 's not necessarily always negative : the human brain attempts to simplify the world by categorizing and grouping like things . but it ’s a thought as to were the idea comes from . it 's a belief in the inherent superiority of one race over another . someone can even accept certain racial stereotypes , ( black people like fried chicken , white people ca n't dance ) and still not believe in the inherent superiority of one race over another . i think these things , racial insensitivity or racial stereotypes are what you 're talking about when you say , "" a little bit racist . "" i believe most people , of all races , accept certain racial stereotypes . as a mixed race person , i 'd love to emphatically claim ' i have no negative biases towards anyone , or any culture ' , but , that is n't True . because of some personal negative encounters as teenager growing up in nyc with some people from haiti , i often find myself becoming defensive , or walls-up initially when i cross paths with haitians , even though the last time i had a negative encounter with any haitian was 10 years ago ; but wonderful exchanges with other hatians as recently as a month ago . if i , with my wonderfully mixed ethnicity , can unintentionally hold on to any type of bias against any individual , because of my default inference of what i expect of the group/culture , then that is racist . what stops me from being fully racist , is that i am aware of the bias , and strive to not let the bias dictate how i actually engage individuals . it is not an excuse for blatant racism although someone growing up in a racist environment is probably more likely to be a racist . all the black kids sat on one side of the room , and all the white kids on another ( there were no other races in the class ) . he also thought it funny . he said he sat with me on the bother side of the room because he was liked by everyone and did n’t associate with some of those black kids in the class . and you could consider that mildly racist though it ’s mostly harmless . the vast majority of blacks are killed by other blacks and black neighborhoods in chicago are almost exclusively much higher crime rate than white neighborhoods . so for the majority of whites , going to englewood will increase their exposure to crime by a couple dozen times . if someone who is black finds my statements to be racist , would that make them a racist because they are focusing on my color as i make the points ? whites and blacks do no feel safe in some neighborhoods based on the fact that their race tends to get harassed a bit more . statistics are statistics and if the racial statistics say that a group of blacks suddenly showing up at a store are more likely to be a flash mob than a group of whites , then would it be racist to be situationaly aware and notice this ? the statement is quite simply that blacks are more likely to commit crime than whites , dozens of times more in some neighborhoods . i would say everyone holds their own prejudices that manifest in forms of racism . what the arguement comes down to is : does recognizing someones ethnicity or racial background , when it 's different than your own , make you racist ? racism states that , regardless of how they prove you wrong , you still hold to the idea they 're a certain way ... it does n't allow for change . well , you 're always going to offend someone , someone is still going to call you a racist even if you do absolutely nothing . i think racist is too far , but i do believe everyone judges each other maybe not due to the color of their skin but the way they dress , act , and well , look . - the statement , as you assert it , “ everyone is a little racist , ” is a hypothesis , a non-operationalized one at that , with no possible way to prove its validity . - not to justify — to acknowledge the strength of the connection between culture and our own world view and values , and to further acknowledge the importance of overcoming implicit , unconscious , cognitive or culturally absorbed bias by first recognizing it . therefore , i prefer to focus on what we can do to improve race relations and racial inequities in our society . it 's not a hateful form of racism , but it is in a way racist . racism as we know it is simply a culturally constructed narrative that is socialized into people as an explination for why we hate other races . the really interesting part is that humans beings hate other people and groups simply because they exist . i feel the modern day over emphasis on racism obviscates this truth that people have always hated other groups that they feel are in competition with them or that they simply dislike for now reason . racism is simply the justification/explination for this intrinsic hatred and narrative stories is the mechanism that humans make sense of their world . humans look at hundreds of indicators about other humans , about whether we can trust the other person . maybe not everyone is racist , but most people have unconscious prejudices . the tendency is not to excuse one ’s self for being slightly racist , but to comfort one ’s self by saying they are not a True racist , since only extreme acts qualify as True racism . all humans have biases , predispositions , generalizations they hold to be True , as so many other commenters have cited ( eg implicit associations test ) . the thing is , so long as you wrap yourself in the shield of being “ not a True racist ” , you lack the ability to be truly introspective about your own racism . therefore , the first step to addressing and improving your own racism is to understand that racism does exist on a spectrum , it ’s not binary . i heard her speak recently at an education conference , and she said something that really stuck with me : i recently heard dr. tony greenwald speak ( yes , the creator of the implicit associations test ( iat ) everyone here is talking about . but do n’t deluded yourself , you will likely hold the biases you hold now , for the rest of your life . in short , we should always strive to be as open minded as possible , and when people point something out you did as racially insensitive , listen to them because they might have a point . though i do n't think this era is the appropriate era to have this discussion , but i think we will someday distinguish racism from a sort of childish ignorance . assuming a stereotype is not the same as spewing hate or committing an act of violence . but maybe someday , we will have the freedom to discern between forgivable ignorance and unforgivable violence . first of all , it 's a little silly to think that anyone is claiming that each and every person has been tested and been proven to be racist . the doc who came to check on the child [ edit : was black ] , and the man 's first thought was , "" no , i want a better doctor "" . racism is so pervasive that all of us growing up in america at least are indoctrinated with some implicit biases . i ca n't do anything about my first thoughts when i see a black man approach me on a dark street or am cut off by an asian driver . so , no , "" everyone is a little bit racist "" is not an excuse , it ' an opportunity . everyone is a little bit biased but i would necessarily say racist nearly everyone has som level of implicit bias and almost every study shows this . second , they might be saying , “ everyone is a little bit racist ” so that they can make folks who are angry that some millennial called them racist last week feel a little less attacked and therefore less oppositional : research shows that the notion of fear or othering another person makes them less receptive to new ideas . what i do agree with you about is that making the claim that ' everyone is a little racist ' is a way to soften and justify one 's own racism - in the sense that it 's supposed to obfuscate and equivocate all the different ranges of racism ... and that their most likely occasionally explicitly racist attitudes fit into the whole ' it 's just a little bit that everyone does ' . with that said , i think racism is largely a spectrum ... and at the lowest end - where people can legitimately claim that they 're not racist , requires continual , mindful application of knowledge , empathy and understanding ... and personally , i think only very few ( if any ) have really achieved this degree of non-racism . which is to say , if we 're not continually searching our internal attitudes and ensuring that they 're not prejudiced or biased , small biases will naturally creep into our behaviour , resulting in implicit forms of racism . given that we tend to be born into families of like race/skin color , and similar have extended family/social networks within the same racial groups and culture ... most people are going to naturally cluster in a way that 's at least a little biased towards their own race and biased against other races . so , while more explicit forms of racism are culturally manufactured , at the very least , we are mildly to moderately racist , unless we specifically make effortful attempts to not be racist across the board . if racism means that you believe that one racial group is superior or inferior to another then i think you are right , that not everyone is a "" little "" racist , and that racism is very much a binary 1 or 0 state . that does not , in any way , comport with the first definition of racism as it does n't matter what you do , what costume you wear , or how loudly you shout at a black woman - if you do n't actively believe that one racial group is superior or inferior to another than you are not racist . what you ca n't do anymore , is go through life without offending someone and being called a racist . so yes , people have a natural tendency towards racism , by virtue of the fact that skin color is an unavoidable indicator of someone being from a different outgroup . i think the addition of hatred and repulsion would make this racism which is n't a universal truth although may be very common . tell me , do studies tend to break down people 's internal thoughts and feelings , or do they break down rates of behavior ? while some studies attempt to wax poetic about motivations - aka internal thoughts and feelings - most focus on behavior rates . lastly , i would reframe the statement from "" everybody is a little bit racist "" to "" everyone has inherent unconscious biases . "" for instance , you assume people having predictable behavior requires people to "" know the internal thoughts and feelings of anyone ever . "" i believe people just say that ' everyone is a little racist ' because everyone thinks racism means anything referencing the colour of someone 's skin . many people that would claim that they are a little racist because they stereotype and associate different sayings and stuff with different races and they make jokes about it none of which are deprecating , which is not ' \ belief that one 's own race is superior \ ' . so basically i think your mistaking people stereotyping and joking with being racist look at the actual lyrics of the song that spread the saying , it is about making people recognize that the small biases are actually racism , and that does not make them the spawn of satan . i think that a lot of people conflate racism with prejudice in certain situations . i do n't think that most people are racist but i do believe that a lot of people are prejudice . i think the statement that "" everyone is a little prejudice "" is more accurate than "" everyone is a little racist "" . neither racism or prejudice are good things and we always should strive to be better than the thoughts that float around in our heads or negative impulses that we have from time to time but recognizing that prejudice is very common is an important first step towards shaping what kind of person you do or do not want to be . i feel like rather than an accusation it ’s more of admittance of a universal flaw as humans to hold bias and stereotypes of races even if one is not conscious of it , or i should say especially when one is not conscious about it . now subconscious racism is n’t as blatant as overt racism . overt racism we are use to seeing is black people being shot by cops , making slant eye gestures at asians , brown people being told they ’re terrorists , latino people being told to go back to their country . but subconscious racism is something that even the individual may have cognitive dissonance about . because it demonstrates that racism is n’t only present in clearly malicious and evil people , in the malfoys and blacks - it ’s also there in warm , kind , funny people who just happened to learn some pretty toxic things growing up in a pretty toxic society . ron eventually accepts hagrid ’s parentage , lets lupin bandage his leg and in the final battle , he worries about the safety of the house elves . some people are prejudiced because they are evil , and some people are prejudiced because they do n’t know better yet . the lesson taught about discrimination should n’t be “ only evil people do it ” , because then all readers will assume it does n’t apply to them . it ’s more of a “ we are all capable of having this flaw and cognitive dissonance and we should work on being more aware of it to be better . ” the human brain processes information very quickly through a process called assimilation . sometimes , new “ boxes ” are created of an existing “ box ” has n’t been established . while this has had a heavy hand in our evolutionary success , it has its downsides , like prejudice and racism , for example . if someone says , “ everyone is a little racist ” , they very well might be trying to justify their own racist tendencies . acknowledging that everyone likely has unfounded biases that they may not even be aware of , is not and attempt to excuse those beliefs . "" everyone 's a little racist "" i have n't seen used to justify racism . i have , however , seen used to force people to acknowledge their own racism . people do n't generally see themselves as evil , so if someone tells them they are racist , they have a hard time reconciling that . it makes it very difficult to call out racist behavior or opinions in some people . because they are unable to see themselves as evil , they reject the claim that their behaviors/opinions are racist , and often even take offense at the suggestion . they justify to themselves that they are not racist ( "" some of my best friends are black "" ) , therefore their behaviors/opinions are not racist , and so it is perfectly acceptable to continue those behaviors/opinions . furthermore , they come away with the impression that claims of racism in general are often False . only once people accept the idea that they could have prejudices can they critically examine their own behavior and determine when they are being racist . now , this is not meant to excuse or justify racism ; racism is still bad , and people should try to be less racist wherever possible . that allows people to reconcile their prejudices with their good intentions , understand when their behavior has been unintentionally harmful , and try to be better going forward . in your second sentence you say "" racism is racism , "" and in the next "" not all racism is equal , "" which is a little like saying "" all animals are equal but some are more equal than others . "" the implication from context is that "" protesting in the street "" is your low bar for racism , when in most people 's reckoning i think that 's a very high bar . if your argument is that racism in all forms is morally reprehensible , you 'd be better served by listing more benign behaviors ( telling racist jokes , saying the n-word as a white person , avoiding or being suspicious of strangers who are minorities ) to reiterate that you understand full range of racism . in particular , your 2 examples do a poor job of displaying the difference in gradations of racism . there is a moral difference between "" protesting in the streets "" and "" going out and murdering , "" regardless of whether or not race is involved . a person who protests in the streets may be just as hate-filled as one who murders , the only difference being in their willingness to enact violence . your examples only show that you recognize that some behaviors are more evil than others , not that you recognize a difference in racism . either way , it represents a real difference in the level of racism , not simply the moral value of the actions themselves . everyone is prone to stereotyping of other individuals different from ourselves . we are not necessarily prone to holding prejudice towards such individuals . whereas prejudice is someone being an actual racist in the True sense . the issue is when you group things together with little information and dislike that entire group because that little information . and just because you do n't accept this view does not make you not racist . easy way for a racist person to defend their non racism . anyone who is justifying that phase is in fact a racist for example , wanting to marry someone of the same race due to being more attracted to them is not racist , but not wanting to marry them because you think they are inferior is . so to answer the op 's question , most people have personal preferences and may sub consciously want to stick to their own race , but no , not all people are a little racist . to be racist you have to actively believe a race is inferior and have prejudice against them . being aware and active confronting racist ideas/stereotypes and spotting it when you see it is key imo . but i get where you ’re going and their point was to soften or make an excuse for whatever kind of ignorant racial belief or thought they have . i 'm american and thought i knew what racism was until i moved to the middle east and worked in africa . it 's called prejudice , not racism , and it 's an inherit fact of nature . racism is n’t just something cartoonishly racist people do , it can be everyday little things . so to begin with , a person is n’t racist because racism is a system or institution that creates an uneven playing field for people of different races/origins/nationalities . a person can be part of that system , which is where the popular opinion that all white people are racists because their all part of “ the system ” that holds them down . the word has become synonymous with prejudice because its replaced and been misused for so long . but replacing prejudice for racist in the phrase “ all people are prejudice ” and we are getting somewhere . every single person alive has prejudged someone when they met them by their appearance or words , and then later they thought , wow ... now that i ’ve gotten to know them , i was wrong about them ... a negative prejudgment is all that ’s required to be prejudice towards someone . racism is institutional , prejudice is negative prejudgment and is the correct word . a person ca n’t be racist , they are part of racism where it exists . an action or outcome can be called racist because it ’s a fruit of the institution . all white people being assumed ( negatively judged ) as “ racist ” is in itself prejudice , because there ’s a negative assumption of guilt based on the color of ones skin , and one must disprove the negative to be accepted . and while it is so narrowly used and abused , there can not be meaningful conversations had about it . maybe that was the goal to make people better understand stereotypes and be more carefull with them by using such a strong comparsion , but maybe youre right and that failed by misuse of the phrase or misunderstanding nonetheless we wont get anywhere arguing about that part . but what are the odds that somebody who has a bias against green m&m s does n't have at least an automatic snap judgement of somebody based on the color of their skin or their accent ? i would disagree with your premise , that there are people in this world without biases based on race . i do not believe such people are possible - human minds are too complex and too hard-wired for discrimination ( whether it be discriminating between two m&m colors or two people ) . now you know that 's a monstrous thing - to have a favorite child - so you answer , "" i love all my children equally . "" the person you 're referring to above who justifies and/or acts upon their inherent biases is the parent who says which child is their favorite and showers that child with more love and attention than the other ... where the person who you believe are n't racist are the parents who tell you that they love all their children equally and do their best to treat them equally . i think in certain contexts you 're right , but in others it 's just a statement to acknowledge the fact that deep down everyone has prejudices about people of other racists . most people would not consider protesting against a race as being a little racist . i will agree that some people will use it as an excuse to be racist but it can also be used to say that we all have biases , it is important to identify them when they occur and think them through . i ca n't speak for everyone else , but i use it when i 'm trying to have a discussion with someone about racism , progress , discrimination , or just political correctness ; and they invariably say , "" but i 'm not racist . "" i explain that , in this society , everyone is a little bit racist , and the best we can do is open our eyes , ears , and hearts to those who are hurt by it , and try to change . plus , it helps to admit to your own prejudice when dealing with stronger racism . it is no surprise that people develop prejudices ; you ca n't blame them . i do n't know if you 'll even get to read my comment , but while any racism is bad , i do agree that everyone is at least a little bit "" racist "" , because i have n't met anyone who is completely unbiased about race , gender , sexuality , religion , ect . however , implicit racism is still alive and well and can be measured experimentally . there are more studies on the subject , but i think this one illustrates my point . this being established , most people have implicit prejudices , which has also been experimentally shown . therefore , the claim that “ everyone is a little racist ” is mostly True , and therefore not exactly disingenuous . however , the fact that most people carry some sort of racial prejudice , like many other facts , is not a valid excuse to perpetuate injustice and prejudice attitudes . after i had lived there for about five years i had become accustomed to my friends being the very diverse racial mix that is hawaii . ( hotel costs in paradise are astronomical ) i stepped into the church social hall to pick up my volunteered for 8 or nine teens . everything in this presupposes that being racist is a bad thing in and of itself and not using racism to justify being a bad person . i think what they mean is sometimes people dont know what they are saying or doing is wrong and thats not always their fualt its a thing you have to learn sometimes if it has been normal in you society to say or do certain things . its all a learning excercise and the only people i dont have time for is the ones who dont want to change or even try and understand why it may or may not be right to say or do things and make their own mind up about it . personally i define racism has seeing a race as better than others , from the posts i 've seen , it seems that your major concern is the prejudice that comes with different races . we see american racism and are horrified ; we have conversations about how backwards and racist american society can be , and how abhorrent it is . there 's a tendency to think that racism is bad , and therefore racism is something done by other people . you say that the saying is used to justify racism - that may be True , but it is certainly not the whole truth . at the very least , i submit that the saying is also used to acknowledge that racism is not the sole pursuit of vaguely defined ' bad people 's . propagation of each species is hard wired into us therefore making us a little racist . >> firstly i would like to point out that there 's absolutely no such thing as being "" a little racist "" in the sense that there is a kind of racism that one can be excused for . as others have stated , there 's a difference between "" prejudice "" and "" racism "" . prejudice is a trait we start learning from birth , it 's called being picky . wether or not those prejudices influence the person in their adult life or not is the distinction between the two , as someone getting uncomfortable but doing nothing to impede a black guy living his life because they grew up in a mainly white neighborhood , and someone acting on those prejudices and calling the cops for the same reasons as bbq becky . if that does n't satisfy you i apologize , but it 's the answer that makes the most logical sense . our brains are limited resources , and this categorizing and sorting is necessary for our advanced cognition . this leads to certain forms of cognitive bias , such as out-group homogeneity . this does n't mean that "" everyone is racist , "" but more that the thought processes that lead to stereotypes and prejudice are not only natural , but a necessary part of our cognition . here 's a very simple question to see whether the claim "" everyone is a little racist "" is used to justify one 's own racism : how often do you hear a very clearly racist person use this statement to justify their racism ? in my experience this term is used in the context of drawing attention to all of our own personal biases so we can work on them , not as an excuse . now , the other form of this is "" black people are even more racist "" or something of that nature , which i have heard as a defense of someone 's own racism . honestly everyone has some sort of racial bias , which most deem as racism . it ’s important to distinguish between racism and prejudice because one is voluntary and the latter is involuntary . where as racism is taking said prejudice and acting on it . if you ’re walking down the street and see a black man walking towards you , you might make certain assumptions about the black individual based on your prejudice . but when you see a black individual walking towards you and you make the conscious effort cross the street especially when you normally would n’t have , that ’s racism . everyone is prejudiced , but those who act upon their prejudices are racist . for something to be "" baseless "" there must be zero supporting evidence in existence , unless the meaning of "" baseless "" has changed in some way . you have other comments accepting that implicit bias is an existing theory , with evidence . further , i would argue ( even if "" baseless "" does not mean : "" without foundation or in fact ) , that many people grew in places where they only knew others who are racist . why do you reject the idea that people can be biased in an implicit manner ( as described in other comments ) , and yet accept that the outright meaning someone gives to the phrase "" everyone is a little racist "" is a justification for racism for them , not anything else ( like an acknowledgement , which is not the same as an excuse ) ? if not , how can you suggest an implicit belief based on something unconscious with ( figuratively ) one hand ( that people do n't mean what they outright say ) , and with the other hand reject implicit beliefs based on an unconscious process in general ( that people do n't have a process causing them to not mean what they say ) ? i think everyone regardless of race has some unconscious prejudices of other races as a majority , not necessarily they think one is better or worse than others just , but i also think that the phrase “ everyone is a little racist ” is a way of saying something racist while trying to come off as not as racist ."
9tjc3y,"age of consent should be "" romeo and juliet "" style until the decision making part of the brain is fully developed ( serious ) the decision making part of the brain does not finish developing until 25 . i ca n't find any solid psychology studies on why 18 was decided as "" adult "" in the us . the teen brain is different from the adult brain . i understand people will argue the biological side : puberty stops earlier than 25 and sexual urges come sooner . that 's why i feel like teens should be able to have sex with other teens , but there is no logic behind an arbitrary teen year where someone can suddenly now have sex with 50 year olds and go through trauma that they might not even realize at the time is happening . the aoc is 16 in some states , 18 in others , 15 is the average for the world i believe . i feel that psychology and power balance are more important than physical development since being manipulated sexually can deeply scar a person for the rest of their life and a power imbalance is a recipe for disaster . what would make the most sense based on how the brain develops is to have close age exemption laws until the decision making part of the brain is fully developed . exemption laws should be determined by the factors influencing psychology and power balance such as reasonable social settings and life experience ( highschoolers are all in the same peer group for example ) . 18 year olds are going off to college and they will reasonably be dating within their peer group , and 25 is when the decision making part of the brain is developed and if a 50 year old tried to groom them , the decision making process would be fully developed and i feel that only then a person could genuinely consent if they really wanted . i dont feel like a 16 or 18 year old should be legally able to have sex with a 50 year old under any circumstances . and of course , people mature at different rates , but things like aoc should be based on the majority , not the exceptions . also , my personal views are that teens shouldnt be able to go to war , so please no arguements like that . i am consistent with decisions that can alter your life forever such as trauma from war or sex , and damage to the brain from drugs . none of this should be until 25 . i have very in depth reasons for all of this , but let 's converse about my main topic . there is not much scientific difference between a 16 year old an 18 year old , but a large difference between an 18 and 25 . the only way i make sense of the world is through science . i do not find solid research behind 16/18/21 being chosen as set ages for things in the usa . what are your thoughts ? what is wrong with the basis of this view ? ( other than how the law would actually be carried out . i have ideas for this but it is too much to get in to for one post )","also , romeo and juliet laws pertain to romances that are established and last once one partner breaks the age limit . someone 18 can still have sex with someone who 's 15 but they ca n't start a new relationship with someone else who 's 15 . the whole point is that romeo and juliet were in a relationship , not that they could have sex with anyone else . romeo and juliet laws would simply apply until 25 but that does n't make sense . the law is on the books to prevent a legal relationship becoming illegal all of a sudden , which would then be legal in a certain amount of time . laws and regulations should be generally based on a realistic basis , they have to mirror societal norms , paradigm shifts and in general the everyday way of life . that 's why you ca n't really have archaic laws , it 's just not feasible to keep them , and if some laws are practically allowed to be ignored , that weakens the overall power of the legal system alltogether . that 's why laws are ( at least in europe , i ca n't comment on the us , as i 'm not familiar with the legal system there ) not 100 % set in stone , you can make changes to them in a controlled manner to keep up with societal changes . laws are based on pragmatism , we need them to keep a way of life and functioning society that the general consensus wants . if we accept this , every legal change has to be examined if it 's feasible or realistic to implement . the thing you propose is impossible to enforce , and it 's not in line with the consensus of the vast majority of people . teens will have sex , and making it illegal just opens the door to certain other problems , like they wo n't have easy access to medical treatment or support should something go wrong , etc . plus since it does n't mirror society 's current way of thinking and current trends , no one would care if teens actually did have sex . it would seem as archaic , no one would keep it , practically it would be impossible to enforce so at best we 'd have the same situation we do right now , but spent manpower and money on implementing changes that are unpractical which is a waste of resources . if you do however intend to somehow enforce it ( and for the sake of argument let 's assume you do ) by changing the fundamental human rights ( for example making a specific policing force for this exact thing ) it would cause even deeper psychological trauma ( for example forcing girls to undergo examinations to make sure they are virgins , which would be even more impractical since you ca n't do the same for men ) , and if you do manage to convict two 17 year olds for having sex , you practically remove two potentially useful members from society for no reason while also ruining their lives , for no reason . 18 years old is approximately the end of high school . legal guardians have a lot of control over and responsibility for the behavior of their children until the end of high school . the end of high school is the end of state provided education . it is the end of the government expectation that guardians make sure that their children get an education . as guardians lose responsibility for their children , their children need to be granted the authority to make their own way . using the same reasoning , these children and teens are not developed enough to make decisions like , purchases , and choosing employer , without being taken advantage of . just because you are not grown up does not mean that this is the case for everyone . you mention a lot of ages and that you think do n’t like 18 . i do n’t think anyone will argue against the fact that 18 is arbitrary . 18 was chosen for practical and social reasons that others have pointed out . moving the age of adulthood to 25 would be hugely impractical , and not representative of where people are in their lives . the idea that these people would have to have parental approval to sign contacts is a bit silly . the "" development period "" is our chance to develop the maturity/habits that we will have a very hard time developing later . so for all key habits ( sex/dating included ) we need to make sure to give people the chance to develop their own fully-responsible-for-self habits well before 25 ( and for many people 25 is late ) . so the trade-off should be an age where there is small demonstrable harm from letting people make their own decisions and that 's balanced by them being more mature later . it is difficult to find any good evidence that 17 year olds are harmed by having an age of consent that does n't prevent them from dating older people so 17 is too high in that trade-off . 16 seems like the optimal choice , though i would understand 17 . while it may be True that the decision making part of the brain does n't finish developing until 25 on average , that does n't mean those under the age of 25 have no skill in decision making whatsoever . yes there 's a large difference between 16 and 25 but society has evolved to the point where we 're expecting 16 year olds to at least be able to make some independent decisions of their own and there are definitely some who can do that maturely and responsibly . this is less about whether the brain is as fully developed as it can be , and more about finding a rough average where the brain is now developed enough that you can be trusted to make your own choices within the society we have . not to mention you 're framing sex between someone older and someone younger as though it 's almost always a case of power and grooming or something really gross . yeah sure , grooming and rape are bad things and we should n't treat them lightly , but a 16-year-old wanting to have sex with someone a little older is n't exactly cause for some massive alarm . and frankly if you had n't noticed , the most conservative places in the us and the world have the lowest ages of consent & youth marriage . one thing these romeo-and-juliet laws ca n't take into account , is that teenage rashness is rooted in a growth spurt , not in under-development . thus the vulnerability of youth peaks at 19 , rather than ( say ) 16 or 22 . that fact oes n't sit well with the politicisation of issues about teen responsibility , but it 's a fact nonetheless . in this case , you 're arguing that people under 25 ca n't be trusted to make potentially life altering decisions . the brain does n't stop developing til the mid 20s while juliet was in her early teens in the play . so your view is that a 16 year old should be legally allowed to have sex with another 16 year old , but not a 50 year old ? for example , in the uk the aoc is 16 , so a 16 year old can consent to sex with a 50 year old . but "" child "" for the purposes of pornography is 18 , so a 50 year old can legally have sex with a 16 year old , but he would n't be allowed to take any photos . what if the 16 year old and his 50 year old partner both testified in court that they were truly madly deeply in love with each other ? however , there is strong evidence that the brain develops continually until the age of around 25 ( as you say ) . but the aoc does n't require the brain to be fully developed , rather that the brain is sufficiently developed . an 18 year old 's brain is more developed than a 10 year old 's . there 's no clear line , but it is evident that society feels the average 18 year old is sufficiently responsible to make that sort of decision for themselves . thirdly , your argument hinges on the assumption that if a 16 year old has sex with a 50 year old , this is likely due to an imbalance of power leading to grooming , emotional abuse and hence the potential for harm . you do n't present any arguments for there being anything inherently wrong with a 16 year old sleeping with a 50 year old if they are both able to make free and informed decisions . the vast majority of states have "" romeo "" clauses to their age of consent laws . i will take a stab and say if you are thinking that the age of consent should be 25 , good luck with that . try telling any 22 year old that they are n't old enough to make decisions about their own lives despite most likely supporting themselves and working a full time job ."
9ticdu,"trump 's new immigration ad is misleading , but not racist on wednesday , trump released a new campaign ad on his twitter account which focuses on luis bracamontes , a twice-deported mexican immigrant who killed 3 police officers . many in the media breathlessly denounced the ad as racist , including journalists from cnn , the washington post , and new york magazine . according to the washington post columnist : > the video stigmatizes a large group of people of color as criminals — killers bent on coming in and killing the law-abiding residents of the united states . this is a terribly reductive reading of an ad . the ad takes issue not with people of color , but with gang members or people with criminal intent who can exploit weak border controls to illegally immigrate to the u.s. and commit crimes . that the immigrant is a person of color is irrelevant . the ad is misleading in blaming democrats for allowing bracamontes to illegally enter the country when it was under bush 's presidency that he came back after two prior deportations . still , the ways in which it is misleading are with political blame-shifting , and not with racism .","do you think that the possibility that this ad has an obvious racial component gave them any pause . like , as in someone in the trump camp said "" hey folks , i think that this ad may be perceived as at least a little bit racist . does it seem weird to you that we are continually having to find plausible deniability for trumps words and actions , and that many of those exact same words and actions that we have to bend over backwards to accept as passingly reasonable are touted as victories and praised by actual out and proud racists ? i could n't tell you with any reasonable certainty whether trump is a secret flaming racist or not . but there are a whole lot of proudly flaming racists who think trump is on their side , and that does not seem to concern trump at all . to use it here , cutting from bracamontes ( a murderer ) to the caravan , to “ who else would democrats let in ” draws a clear line from bracamontes to “ these people who are somehow conceptually related to bracamontes ” to “ people the democrats would let in are somhow conceptually related to bracamontes . ” which would make sense except for the footage of the caravan , for which there is no substantial evidence of widespread gang membership or “ people with criminal intent ” . unless you want to include “ being part of the caravan ” as criminal intent , but that would be kind of circular . the ad “ takes issue ” with gang-members and criminals , and then shows a large group of south american migrants , implying that the two characteristics are linked . quickly cutting back and forth between a murderer and big crowds of people is supposed to get you to associate those things together - "" all these people are just like this one criminal ! "" ... and the ad declines to say , because they want you to assume that all these people are criminals and they 're coming to kill you . the ad is designed to make the viewer angry at the crowds of brown people apparently coming in to the country to commit crimes . i bet i could find a clip of some white guy spouting off in court about how he wants to kill people , and cut that together with a crowd of white people at a wal-mart on black friday , put some banging war drums over it ... and that would also be super racist . trump has repeatedly harped on the criminality of immigrants . he started his campaign by calling mexican immigrants ( by and large ) rapists , drug dealers , gang members , etc , with a small number ( "" some "" ) possibly being good people . and furthermore , trump has repeatedly been soft on crime - from white people . on top of that , he stokes fears that all immigrants - not just undocumented ones - are bad for us . he 's tried repeatedly to reduce legal avenues for immigration , even though there is n't really evidence that this is bad , and in fact our immigration levels are probably lower than they should be . so yes , in a sense , he 's not inherently wrong to harp on crime , but this racism is about how he focuses his time and energy , and this ad is another symptom of the racist way that manifests . he focuses specifically on crime by "" illegal immigrants "" and he stokes fear that all immigrants are secretly bad . you of course are free to see it how you wish but since you ’re here to change your view , that makes our job much more difficult . if you do n’t want your view to be changed to “ this ad was racist , because it singled out a minority immigrant criminal even though there ’s zero statistical reason be afraid of hispanic people or undocumented immigrants ” what exactly do you want your view to become ?"
9tg3l0,"blackface done in the name of racial authenticity or admiration are usually convoluted excuses for racism respect for an entertainer , politician , or general person of color , does not require that you imitate their racial complexion . accuracy in depicting a representation of a person of color do n’t require darkening your complexion . many times this is done specifically to communicate the blackness of the imitated person . the tradition of this kind of imitation is rooted in historical racism and is not creative or necessary for non-adversarial imitation . mentioning this as the motivation for dressing in blackface is an attempt to neutralize the racism in blackface mimicry .","and if i dress up as white mace windu , tell me i wo n't offend someone else for white washing a black character . an audience can use critical thought to determine whether racial stereotypes are being exaggerated and mocked . some people colored their face to try and be spot on the character they were cosplaying . and if you are black , how can you say intention and comedy play no roll , or service no excuse for such a thing ? since samuel l jackson was brought up a few times i ’m curious if changing the race of an established fictional character ( nick fury ) is racist or does this get license because of power dynamic too ? there ’s so many complicated and convoluted racial dynamics one could worry themselves over in society if one chose to , but i ’d argue that reasonable people do n’t . this historic context of blackface is absolutely rooted in racism . however , blackface was never racist because a white man put black paint on his skin . it was racist because it created a caricature of black people and explicitly mocked and degraded them . the performances portrayed black people as goofy idiots , and the costuming left the lip area white , leaving them with big , clownish grins . the malicious caricature and portrayal of black folks is what was racist . compare american blackface to the white british actors who played othello in shakespearean plays . white man in black paint . however , this historic context is quite different , and there was nothing racist about it . othello is just a tragic hero , and iago , the one person who could be considered racist in the play , is painted in a truly villainous light . putting on black paint in this context is far from racist . so , it really depends on what the direct context of the black paint is . when you strip away the caricature , the mockery , and the malice ... you strip away everything that makes it racist . at that point , it 's just black paint and if someone wants to look like mace windu for halloween because he 's a badass , it 's unjustified to call it racist . no , but to make a good cosplay convincing it does ; you typically dye your hair or wear a wig to match the object too so i see no reason why not the skin colour . i would tend to agree with you that most people who make this "" i 'm dressing up as someone out of admiration , not racism "" are well aware of the history and meaning of blackface , and are using the excuse as a way to get away with blatant racism . similarly , despite the fact that the swastika has a long , multicultural history , it has one overarching meaning to most people today , and people who sport swastikas on t-shirts probably are n't celebrating ancient hindu . however , in today 's modern society , it is conceivable ( albeit somewhat unlikely ) that there are people who are unfamiliar with the history of blackface . ultimately , i think the important thing here is intent and also how someone reacts when they are told that blackface is offensive ( if they somehow did n't know already ) . i think it possible that some white people , who are somehow oblivious to the entirely racist history of blackface , could believe that simply putting on makeup to look like a black person could n't be racist because they simply do n't mean it that way . the True test of whether someone is racist in this context is whether -- after having the history and context and meaning of blackface pointed out to them , and learning how dehumanizing and insulting blackface can be to the descendants of enslaved peoples -- that person maintains that they should be allowed to do it anyway . a person who is ignorant of its history and dons blackface for a costume , and then removes it when they are told how offensive it is to not only black people but anyone who abhors racism , is n't necessarily a racist . if i were to paint two pictures , one of samuel l jackson with light skin and one with dark skin , would the dark one not be a more accurate representation ? it might not be required , but accuracy is certainly enhanced by it . when someone does this with the intention of poking fun at people who are hypersensitive to racial issues and you call them a racist , then they win by proving their point and you lose because you took the bait . i do n't have enough black friends to be able to pull this sort of thing off without looking racist myself , but i reckon that if i was going to a fancy dress party with some indian mates it would be outrageously good banter to brown-up and the only people who 'd be offended would be white middle class bellends ."
9tfvbj,"the beliefs that mental health should be destigmatised , lgbt + people are disadvantaged , and lgbt + people are not mentally ill can not all be rationally held simultaneously . > a mental disorder , also called a mental illness or psychiatric disorder , is a behavioural or mental pattern that causes significant distress or impairment of personal functioning . that 's the definition for mental disorder that i found , and it seems to match how people talk about it , so it 's the one i 'll be using until someone presents a better one . my line of reasoning is as follows : - if mental illness should be distigmatised , one should not be embarrassed or reluctant to say they or someone they care about have a mental illness . - mental illness , as expressed in the definition , means any form of thought pattern or action pattern that is disadvantageous . - lgbt + people express themselves through their actions and , presumably , have thoughts that classify them as lgbt + . - thus , if we agree that lgbt + people are disadvantaged , this would qualify as a mental illness because it is a pattern of mental and physical behaviour that "" causes significant distress or impairment of personal functioning "" . there are two answers i 've seen to this . - the most common one is that people do n't want something that should be fine to be classed as a mental illness , which is a perfectly rational view to have . it is , however , inconsistent with the belief that mental health should be destigmatised because it implies that having a mental illness is a bad thing . - the second one is that it is only disadvantageous because society treats lgbt + people unfairly and thus the problem is with society not the people . this still to me echos a judgement on mental health , but putting that aside , i remain unconvinced . by this logic , we will never have mental disorders once we learn how to treat them all . this is simply not the case . i can be treated for a disease , this does not mean i never had it or that it does n't exist . the disorders are the disorders themselves , not the repercussions of the disorders . therefore , i am making the case that to hold all of those views at once , one either needs to not believe lgbt + people are disadvantaged , not believe mental health should be destigmatised , or believe that lgbt + people are mentally ill . please note this cmv is not about any one of these topics itself . it is not about if lgbt + people are disadavantaged , it is not about whether they are mentally ill , it is not about if they are real , it is not about whether or not mental health should be destigmatised . i want to keep this to the disconnect between these three views , ideally by talking to and coming to understand one who holds all of them simultaneously .","i 'm not sure how you got from that to talking about disease and mental disorder in the next sentences . being treated badly by society does not entail that this maltreatment happened because it 's a disease or disorder . ( we do often say that illness and disability in general should be less stigmatized ; the notion is not limited to mental illness ) there are many gay people who do not feel any distress at all about being gay . why should they be considered ill when they feel no distress and trying to “ cure ” them would cause them distress ? second , for convenience sake i will put a blanket comment that "" lgbt should not be considered a mental disorder "" is separate from gender dysphoria , which some trans people suffer from , being a mental disorder . when i argue against lgbt being a mental disorder , i am discussing the state of being lgbt , not the distress associated with gender/body mismatch . let 's put your definition of mental illness right next to one of your bullet points . you 've gone from a definition of mental illness that involves significant distress or impairment of personal function to "" any thought pattern that is disadvantageous . "" under the definition of mental illness in your second bullet , which nobody ( including yourself , in your first bullet ) uses , things like "" is n't very good at mental math and screws up their tips at restaurants "" or "" drives aggressively "" are disadvantageous and thus mental disorders . if you instead use your original definition , of "" significant distress or impairment of personal function "" , being lgbt does n't fall under that at all . it is n't being lgbt that results in that distress ( excepting gender dysphoria present in some trans people ) , it 's societal mistreatment of people who are lgbt that causes it . now , even under your own initial definition of mental disorders , being lgbt does not apply , and you need to use an expansive and meaningless definition to make your argument . but that initial definition you used is still overly expansive and vague . let 's loop back to the dsm-v proposed definition of a mental disorder : i bolded some important points here that pretty much directly point out why being lgbt should not be considered a mental disorder , by an organization which , obviously , seeks to destigmatize mental health issues as part of their goal of better treatment . the stress or negative consequences of being lgbt is almost solely due to societal pressure against them . there is no clinical utility to calling being lgbt a mental disorder , and in fact it is likely to cause potential harms because even if we wish mental illness to be destigmatized , we recognize that defining something as a mental illness enables bigotry against it because there is still a stigma . tl ; dr : your initial definition of mental disorder is both inaccurate compared to actual definitions , and still failed to define lgbt people as mentally disordered , so you expanded the definition even further to basically describe "" anything that has disadvantages "" to make your point . i would argue that the whole concept of having "" mental disorders "" is flawed and needs to be evaluated . when , indeed , for so many "" mental disorders "" the individuals appears to have positive attributions that exist as trade offs with the negative ones ? "" mental illness "" is defined by the fact that there is distress or harm being caused to the individual in question or someone close to them . you would n't refer to someone with cancer as a "" canceric "" or someone with aids as a "" aidsian "" , so why then is it ok to say that people are "" schizophrenics "" or "" manic depressives "" instead of that they suffer from issues in that category ? anyway using this logic , yes experiencing homosexual attraction may not be what we consider to be the "" norm "" and thus might be categorized as "" deviant "" ( again , this is without the usual connotations , here just meaning , "" different from normal/average "" ) , but it 's has nothing to do with being a "" mental health issue "" until some reports harm being caused by it . de-stigmatizing mental illness does not mean that one ceases to believe that it ’s disadvantageous , only that one should n’t be embarrassed or penalized for being honest about it . being gay is not inherently disadvantageous , it ’s only discrimination that makes it so . hence one can believe that being gay is not a mental illness but still believe that gay people are disadvantaged due to discrimination . this belief would in no way limit their ability to also believe mental illness should n’t be destigmatized . being lgbt does not cause distress any more than liking blonds causes distress . the mental pattern that is the problem is people stigmatizing and hating lgbt people . so the disadvantage that they face is external not internal and thus not a mental illness ."

9tffo5,"racism , sexism , homophobia , and transphobia are all mindsets without good reasoning . i 'll try to clarify what i meant by my title . by good reasoning i mean a logical reason that is supported by facts . an example of this would be a fear of heights as falling can be potentially deadly . racism is prejudice , discrimination , or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one 's own race is superior . no race is superior to another , while certain traits can vary among different races , this does not make a single race objectively better than another . an individual may be better or worse than another individual in a certain activity , but this would be an individual case and ca n't be scaled to an entire race . the history of racism in the world , and how races are spread across countries can affect various statistics , but this does not show a logical reasoning to racism . sexism is prejudice , stereotyping , or discrimination , on the basis of sex . while each sex is better at different things from a biological standpoint , a single sex is not objectively better . a specific sex may be more likely to be better at an individual activity , but this comes down to an individual basis . an individual may be better at things that others of the same sex may , on average , be worse at . sexism does not have a logical reason , as most traits are individualistic . homophobia is dislike of or prejudice against homosexual people . homosexuality is not a choice and is just a sexual orientation ( same with bisexuality , asexuality , etc. ) . an individual being sexually attracted to the same sex does not make them inferior or superior to another . many religious people do not like homosexuals because or religious reasons however these religions fail to give a logical reason as supported by facts that can be proven as to why homosexuality is bad . transphobia is intense dislike of or prejudice against transsexual or transgender people . transgender people are people who are a different gender than the one assigned at birth . gender is the state of being male or female ( typically used with reference to social and cultural differences rather than biological ones ) . gender is not biological sex . there 's no logical reason to hate trans people . all 4 of these hateful mindsets have hurt and/or do hurt society , and do not have a logical reasoning behind them . no race , sex , sexual orientation , or gender identity is inherently harmful . problems with a single group typically come down to individual problems or a problem with a subset of the whole , but most people use blanket discrimination . these mindsets are not productive and are purely harmful to those they discriminate against .","few people disagree that racism is bad , people just do n't agree on what acts are racist . if someone wants to do something you consider racist they likely think it 's justified and thus not racist or homophobic or what have you . i 'm not saying this to excuse this behavior , but you can not focus on "" racism is bad "" then pat yourself on the back when people agree . must a person feel badly , or be villified for not being attracted to an obese person who identifies as not being fat ? why ca n't i be me , why ca n't i be the person i identify as , the person i feel i am on the inside , the person who identifies as not being attracted to trans people ? if i am not attracted to an 80 year old ( and never will be ) who had plastic surgery , botox injections , body implants , hormone treatments , other surgery and identifies as a 30 year old then i am not to be villified for being as i am and the way i see . i think something you 're missing here is that there is bad reasoning and then there is bad arguments . 1 +1 = 2 is an axiom , 0-1 = -1 is also an axiom . from those two axioms , i can reason that 2 - 1 = 1 . however , if my axioms were that 1 +1 = 1 , and 2-1 = 2 , then i could reason that 0-1 = 0 . this is not bad reasoning because it makes sense given the axioms we are presented with , but it is a bad argument because it is based on poor axioms . similarly , if i held the axiom that "" black people cause all crime "" , then i could adequately reason that i should be afraid of them . this is not a bad reasoning , but it is simply a bad argument because it is based on False axioms . the mindsets you hate are not rooted in poor reasoning , those people are as logical as we are , what they lack are accurate facts . what about when that mindset , and the encouragement of it lead to an advantage for the individual . if the person is a certain sex , they benefit from reducing the others sex 's access to economic , social and political power . by heavy restricting rights to groups they are not a part of , the person can increase their own effective power in a society . the phobias are a mindset that give "" validity "" to the oppression and by spreading the phobia they strengthen their position in society . this logic alone could be a "" good reasoning "" for someone to hold these views , and i think is often the reason that these views exist . it 's just a reaction i 've had since i was probably 6 or 7 to be disgusted by them , and never want to see or hear about them . i am sexually attracted to white women and turned off by asian women . this is because of the physical traits of the white and asian races . there is a ranking so i think one race is superior to the other . this is a fact that i am sexually or not sexually attracted to the races . in the absence of any other available information , you have to go on what you know which is surface characteristics like race , gender , etc . i do n't see anything wrong with making decisions based on limited information - we do it all the time based on other surface characteristics like clothing , attractiveness , age , etc . just as a philosophical position , i agree that all those forms of institutional bigotry are without good reasoning . however i 'll add the caveat that personal experience can form a justified opinion in certain conditions . if you 've been mugged once and that 's been a person of a particular skin color , that could justify a racist position . repeated negative experiences with a certain gender can form a sexist opinion . several of my female friends have fallen victim to guys who got them pregnant and then ran for the hills . i 'm also aware that my own position in life makes it super easy for me to abandon my family and go live with a mistress . racism : when someone is a different race , they are very easily identifiable as being not of your tribe . since loyalty among a tribe was beneficial for survival , racism is just a vestige of what used to exist for a "" logical reason that is supported by facts . "" sexism : tribes in which there was a division of labor between the sexes outcompeted tribes in which this division did not exist . we can infer the truth of this statement by the fact that there is a division of labor by sex in nearly every culture ever observed . in this sense , there is a "" logical reason supported by facts "" for the maintenance of gender roles : it improves your odds of survival . homophobia/transphobia : belonging to a tribe does n't just mean looking like everyone else ( racism ) , it means acting like everyone else . by excluding from the tribe those who display aberrant/unusual behavior , unity in the tribe is preserved . a unified tribe is more likely to successfully hunt , gather , and protect ; members of a unified tribe are more likely to survive . too bad it takes literally thousands of years for us to adapt to an environment in which these things no longer promote our survival . all of these things are moving targets , and disagreement about what counts as , say , racism is a major sticking point . that 's perfectly sound reasoning ; it just starts from stupid premises ."
9tfegw,"voting based on your income level , instead of your principles , does n't make a whole lot of sense i understand that people do , but it puzzles me that people would base their voting decisions solely on their household income when there are many social issues , civil rights issues , environmental issues , and general freedoms and liberties that matter a whole lot more than whether you need to hire a cpa . i 'm not sure i understand by what thread of logic being a high earner ( or alternately , a low earner ) outweighs principles and values on major issues in terms of choosing a candidate , amendment , etc. to vote for . anyone care to change my view on this ?","i think you 're underestimating how much income level and socioeconomic status influence principles . someone who grew up with a stable family , steady income , and good sex ed is likely to look at abortion very differently from someone who grew up with poor sex ed , little access to birth control , and in communities where few people are financially able to support a child . when socioeconomic status generally falls along party lines , i do n't think it 's because people are ignoring their values on major issues , but rather than those values are often directly related to socioeconomic status . your income level and economic principles are arguably more important to your well being than the struggles of the guy down the street . the fundamental problem with the current system is that the left is simultaneously preaching socialism ( a weaker economic policy ) while also demanding everything from equality to advantage for those they deem oppressed . given the choice of an economic incentive and a social incentive , most poor people would choose to put food on the table and most rich people would choose to have more control of their money . generally speaking , the only time a social incentive beats an economic one is when you simultaneously can afford to take the hit , are willing to take said hit , and are either ignorant or willing to throw the people that ca n't take the hit under the bus in exchange for the target of the social policy . the only reason we the freedom and the time to consider these social issues is because we live in a society where there is relative plenty for everyone . - if your principles are to make more money - that directly relates to your income level . - i also think you are painting a broad brush on the rich who want their taxes raised to help benefit society . many of the rich who are on the left want their taxes raised ."
9tf26y,"socialism & redefining "" ownership of the means of production "" as taxation . socialism is completely misunderstood and still defined by 100-year old political platforms , violent revolutions , and the descent into communism ( a political , not economic , philosophy ) . so naturally , when you hear pundits talk about socialism -- especially pundits with right leaning political views -- the more grotesque and disastrous you can make socialism sound , the better . however , socialism is just social capitalism , if we view socialism as ownership . when we talk about corporations in a capitalist system , specifically public corporations , we talk about ownership . when we own 1 share of apple , inc. , we "" own "" apple , or at least a microscopic piece of it . we get a tiny share of apple 's profits every 3 months . we have ownership in apple . now , if we want to control apple , inc. , we need to own 51 % of the shares of apple . that way we have the overwriting majority on all decisions , if 1 vote equals 1 share . socialism is defined mostly as "" the social ownership of the means of production . "" nowhere does this definition specify control . therefore , the state , if it intends to take some of a corporation 's profits and then redistribute them for social purposes , does not need to take over and then control private companies . it just needs an ownership stake . just like a shareholder of apple does not need to control apple , it just needs to own a share of it . if we think of citizenship like being a shareholder in a giant corporation , and if we as citizens require certain "" social dividends "" , we simply need to own a larger piece of corporate profits . the way to accomplish that would be taxation , not control . taxation in this form is a kind of ownership . therefore , socialism defined as "" ownership of the means of production "" can be reworded as "" taxation of the means of production . "" as much taxation as would be required to implement social policies and maintain fiscal stability . this definition , in my view , is the correct modern definition of socialism , and it would also be much less controversial .","socialism is not wealth distribution , the definition of socialism is that that those who work the means of production own those same means that they work . the rail workers collectively own the rail lines , the production line workers and automation engineers collectively own the factory , the nurses , doctors , paramedics , and medical researchers collectively own the hospital , etc . the government owning all industry is not socialism , the workers have no say over the conditions in which they work , the government , and the 300 million other idiots in the voting population do . this is called state capitalism , and was what the soviet union was striven towards as it saw the jump from feudalism to state capitalism as a step towards socialism and ultimately the communism they desired . state capitalism would only become socialism if after the government owns all industry , it ceded control to the workers in those industries . you 're just cherry picking this definition because it does not specify control explicitly . the company makes $ 10,000 in revenue , has $ 9,000 in costs , so it has $ 1,000 in profit . if you have 51 % of the company , you can vote on how the company runs and because you have the majority , you will always win . first , the government owns 0 % of the company . next , they take their cut from the revenue , not the profit . finally , the government does n't vote on how companies should act . they create regulations that force companies to act in certain ways . in capitalism , the government has their power because they can dictate how companies act , regardless of their ownership stake . there is no such thing as taxes in a communist society . another way ( dare i say the socialist way ) of putting the ownership of the means of production into the hands of the people is to have all the people who work somewhere be the sole owners of these means . this would mean that someone who cleans the toilets owns just as big of a piece of the company that they work at as a random manager in that same company does . higher skill set jobs could still pay more , the only difference is that everyone will have to agree with the paying structure and has a vote ."
9td4oh,"there is no good purpose for birthright citizenship today . at the time the 14th amendment was drafted , there was an ongoing debate about whether formerly enslaved people counted as citizens . southern states did not want ex-slaves to vote , so they fought tooth and nail to keep them from it . this is why the 14th amendment got passed : nobody , not even politicians in the south , could deny that black americans were born in the us , and therefore there was nothing they could argue against anymore . fast-forward to today : there is no question of black americans ' citizenship . the impetus behind the original drafting of the 14th amendment is moot . foreigners who have their kids here today were not shackled inside a boat and brought across an ocean away from their homes ; basically all of them come here of their own volition . therefore , the question of the 14th amendment is no longer one of civil rights as it was back in the late 19th century , but a question of whether we should be giving people an easy way to game the system and get their kids , and they themselves , an easy way in to gaining citizenship into the us while everyone not born in the us or with family in the us has to wait in line instead . you can change my mind by explaining why this kind of thing is an ideal state of affairs .","the original purpose of the 14th amendment was to protect former slaves who were brought to the us unwillingly . [ this is n't True if you count children who are too young to consent to being brought by their parents . ] therefore the 14th amendment has nothing to do with civil rights . 2.5 there is no other civil rights justification for the 14th amendment besides protecting people who were brought to the us against their will . and that premise does n't stand up well either - birthright citizenship gives broad protection from interference by the state in granting membership in the polity . note that anyone with resources , as the rich chinese mothers who game the system by giving birth in the us , will be able to game ( most ) systems . is that a worse problem than a state having the power to strip citizenship from groups that they do n't like ? reason 1 in favor of the 14th a : there is a long term and constant effort by some groups to limit benefits to the children of illegal immigrants . the courts decided that not allowing free education to these children would create a permanent sub-class of citizenry destined to be illiterate , uneducated , and easily taken advantage of for as long as there are illegal immigrants coming in . reason 2 in favor of the 14th a : the united states national debt per person is currently just under $ 66,000 . you may consider that a million new babies ( a number i just made up for convenience ) from undocumented immigrants is a drop in the bucket but that number will multiply out over the same years as the debt increases . holy hell , we should be doing everything we can to have more people have more babies here just so we can tax them later to reduce our national debt ! but birthright citizenship is a whole hell of a lot better than bloodline citizenship , which i view as the most horrible aspect of the world we live in . one big benefit of birthright citizenship is that it prevents the creation of a permanent underclass of non-citizens . imagine for example , we did not provide birthright citizenship to chinese immigrants in the 1800s . a large chunk of those people would likely still not have citizenship today . now , today , we may have a population of undocumented immigrants . a permanent population without full representation or citizenship in any nation is both a humanitarian and economic concern . she is trying to buy a house here , but her lack of citizenship makes it even more difficult . she 33 , and she 's trying to have a child soon . citizenship is typically a requirement for student aid . seems like this is a good argument for not eliminating birthright citizenship . it was intended to explicitly articulate what had previously been assumed for whites and make clear that the concept applied to everyone , regardless of race . birthright citizenship reflects an ideal of american democracy that i think is under appreciated these days — we do n’t care who your parents were . birthright citizenship is the natural application of that ideal to citizenship . the 14th amendment applies to the person being born — it does n’t say anything about parents . we do n’t care who your parents were and they did n’t make you an american . it goes through the common law history of birthright citizenship and how it was applied in the us from the beginning of the country . / foreigners who have their kids here today were not shackled inside a boat and brought across an ocean away from their homes ; basically all of them come here of their own volition . in the 1880s , they are excluded from immigration and barred from citizenship . "" - before the civil war , states did n't necessarily have to follow the provisions stated in the bill of rights ; only congress had to . the 14th amendment changed that . this second sentence of the amendment means that states have to respect the bill of rights as well as basic civil rights and the rights that come along with citizenship , the idea was that there were rights that were so basic ; so integral to citizenship that they could not be narrowed by the states . - despite the promises and protections of citizenship , lee says it is abundantly clear that different racial groups were , and often are , seen as unable or unworthy to function as True american citizens . - for asian immigrants , the racial argument at the time was that ' it did n't matter whether one were born in the us or not , asians as a race , are unassimilable . neither were the former slaves at the time of the 14th amendment 's passage . if the us did n't want to give the children of foreigners birthright citizenship while protecting former slaves , they easily could . they could have granted birthright citizenship only to people whose parents had been here for 10 or 20 years and it still would have covered those slaves ."
9tbe0o,"child support should be based on income and custody , and usage outside of supporting the child should be a crime so i ’ve tried to segment my views into a few categories so that each can be approached more directly . 1 is sort of a contingency condition for child support , with 2-4 being my feelings more specifically about child support allotment and usages . i do not currently pay or receive child support , but i do have a child and am married . these are only observations from friends who either pay or receive child support , and my feeling on the overarching situation . 1 ) i believe that both parties should be able to back out of a pregnancy , given sufficient notice . if the mother wishes to abort , obviously she can overrule the father in that situation , but if she wishes to put up for adoption and deliver , the father should be able to claim custody and in doing so removes the mother from child support requirements . in the inverse if the father does n’t want to keep the child , and in sufficient time notifies the mother , he should be able to relinquish custody and thereby child support payments . a potential argument of this stance is that , should the child starve or otherwise go without being provided for . my view on that is that it should be no different than if a parent were otherwise unavailable , either due to disappearance or death . if a single parent is unable to provide for a child , the child will likely be taken by the state . 2 ) child support should be determined by custody and income , with an upper and lower limit . if custody is 50/50 , and both parents make the same amount of money , no child support should be exchanged . as those numbers skew , so should the child support figure . additionally , there should be an upper and lower limit to child support . for example , if one parent is making $ 10m/year and the other parent makes works at taco bell , the child should not be expected to live like a millionaire with the parent working at taco bell . however in the case of marriage i believe alimony , which is a separate topic , should assist in covering the gap if there is a sudden lifestyle adjustment due to the divorce , and can see the argument being applied to children from a marriage accustomed to a certain lifestyle as well . this is also dependent upon the next stance . 3 ) child support should be legally required for the use of the child only , and it should be considered at least misdemeanor theft to use it in any other way , depending on the total income . to continue the income disparity above , $ 10m/year vs minimum wage , the child support should not be able to be used on things for the parent . i think there ’s things that are gray areas , such as housing , in which an argument can be made that the parents housing benefits the child , and while i can see this being abused i believe it ’s better than the alternative . i ’m specifically against things like using it for frivolities like a ferrari , or a vacation for the parent only . 4 ) child support should have a continually adjusted computation , maybe each tax year or something like that , for incomes that could vary wildly . examples of this is something like actors or athletes in which they may have a substantial income but for a short period of time . making $ 10m/year for 5 years , with the real chance of a career ending injury , is different than being a ceo making $ 10m/year for the foreseeable future .","you seem to imply that checks for "" money laundering "" could also raise flags with child support . but you 've already limited the amount child support can be , and how many people will be receiving the maximum amount anyway ? if you wanted to examine paystubs vs bank account status you 'd need at least reasonable suspicion someone was misusing the money . but right now if that reasonable suspicion exists you can challenge the support order in court and get it changed . of course i should be able to bank it -- i should n't have to return it to the other parent . you are literally penalizing parents who plan for their children 's future . and now people have incentive to hide their pregnancies from sperm contributors as long as possible if they are morally opposed to abortion , which is quite feasible to do if the act of conception was a casual affair . the other alternative to the current system -- where a sperm contributor can back out at any time -- is a terrible idea ( i posted a cmv about it a few days ago ) because it gives potential sperm contributors exactly zero incentive to participate honestly in contraceptive efforts . the person has $ x , $ y from child support and $ z from income , but when they spend it it only comes from a communal pot . which then just means , as long as they spend at least $ y on housing and a car and other things "" for the child , "" they can do whatever they want . its already extremely easy to shift funding around and have a superior lifestyle as a result . all someone has to do is make the kid live more extravagantly . for example if i get $ 250 a month in child support , i 'm just going to spend that money on food and eat what i cook for the kid . then i do n't have to pay for food anymore , but the spend is categorically "" on the child . "" a mother ’s choice to have an abortion comes down to her right to bodily autonomy , not her a “ right ” to back out of parenting . when you decide to bring a child into this world you have a legal responsibility to provide for their safety . in some cases people will fulfill that responsibility by choosing to place the child up for adoption . contracts will be signed so the birth parents legally transfer their responsibility to someone else . if a mother would like to do this she can with the fathers permission . otherwise , if the father is n’t on the birth certificate but wants the child himself he can pursue that matter in court . alternatively , if the father wants to place the child up for adoption but the mother does not she can choose to raise the child herself ."
9tb22c,"jordan peterson is n’t alt-right , or anywheres close in political discussions of late , whenever i hear jordan peterson ’s name brought up , it ’s always with the label of “ alt-right ” . when asked why he ’s alt-right , typically i will hear criticism that he is “ anti-women ” , “ anti-lgbt ” , or even a “ dangerous religious fundamentalist ” . perhaps my view may be biased ( obligatory diversity disclaimer : i ’m a straight white male under 30 ) , but having listened to ~ 100 hours of his lectures , i do n’t get the sense that peterson is alt-right . the closest i ’ve heard to him even touch close to this territory is in his explanations of the psychology of why someone would become alt-right , but understanding someone ’s motives does n’t at all mean that you are that person . so , change my view : the lobster jp is n’t alt right post-debate edit : while i do n’t feel like this debate was entirely productive — far from my mind being changed , my opinion was strengthened ( for a few reasons i ’ll outline later ) — i do think a few interesting things came to the surface . - no one seems to have a hard and fast definition of “ alt - right ” . whether that is by design ( on the part of nazis trying to walk a fine line ) or accidental ( by media hysteria ) no one can pin down . i think this debate highlighted why labels are so problematic in politics . my takeaway is that they should n’t be used . - quite a bit of equivocation in this debate centered around traditionally conservative and alt-right positions ; many people now see views like “ pro- nuclear family ” or “ pro responsibility ( instead of rights ) ” as hard right positions not worthy of discussion in the public sphere . overall , i have to say i ’m a bit disappointed . i hoped to see someone bring up quotes of jp saying dastardly things or perhaps even a long forgotten picture of jp posing with richard spencer . unfortunately , due to the above two themes highlighted , that did n’t happen . i mentioned in a comment that i ’m a fairly rabid atheist ; what i did n’t mention was that before becoming an atheist , i was a christian . i largely turned away from this view due to my realization that there were little to no good reasons for this position . when i had tried to discuss arguments against christianity with my christian peers , they generally made the same kinda of bad arguments and equivocations that i saw in this debate about jp . anyways , thanks cmv community ; this was n’t productive but it was interesting .","his views on traditional family values ( particularly that gay couples raising kids could be harmful to the children , and calls for stronger societal enforcement of monogamy ) are problematically appealing to the alt-right mentality . his discussions of the denigration of western culture and civilization ( including the internally contradictory claims that western values are correct while rejecting many of those values ) , and his attacks on progressive ideals as "" post-modern neo-marxism "" , fit in quite nicely with the alt-right perception that liberal values have infected society and allowed/caused it to degrade . his statements that lobsters have hierarchical structures ( justifying therefore that structures are not caused by societal systems but by immutable biological truths ) are oddly similar to claims from white supremacists that the supremacy of men over women and whites over non-whites is simply "" biotroof . "" his claims that male violence against other men is part of what keeps society in check , and that "" crazy women "" exist due to the societal rejection of violence against women , is very similar to the views of groups like the proud boys on the importance of violence . which fits the alt-right worldview both in the "" society used to be good but now sucks "" way and in the specific defense of "" masculine power . "" does it require self-identification , or can we identify someone 's beliefs based on the positions they hold rather than the identity with which they would label themselves ? okay so alt-right is a loosely connected and somewhat ill-defined grouping of white supremacist / white nationalist 's , anti-semites , neo-nazi 's , far right and fringe of hate groups . if we would want to distill of what makes someone alt right , it would be people who hold , or have ideas of similar to . the poster boys for alt right would be jared taylor , richard spencer , milo yiannopolous , trump , and about half of youtubers right now . such as pepe the frog , the alt right flag . he is occasionally caught in photo 's with alt-right supporters , figures with the alt-right flags and pepe symbols . anti-feminism / anti-lgbt ( peterson got popular on anti-lgbt rhetoric , anti-lgbt pronouns , women have their place in hiearchy , women are much unhappier than in 60 , therefore we should return to that social structure etc. . peterson would not describe himself as alt-right , and would not claim any of the more obviously offensive positions that the alt-right holds . it 's unlikely that he 'd e.g. advocate directly for a white ethnostate , or describe immigrants as rapists , or whatever . however , his rhetoric appeals greatly to those among the alt-right or the anti-sjw crowd or whatever you call them/however you slice them . he talks about "" postmodern neomarxism "" , which is basically a shibboleth that means "" leftist sjws . "" additionally , his philosophy as a whole tends to line up pretty heavily with alt-right values . his concept of making sure your house is in order before criticizing others is echoed very strongly in right-wing positions against foreign aid or in criticisms of sjws for talking about social issues when "" more important "" issues have arose . i do n't really care much what 's in peterson 's heart of hearts or whether he 'd self-describe as an alt-right reactionary ; he 's a public figure whose philosophy seems to near-universally draw attention from the alt-right and his political positions and way of phrasing arguments is solidly designed to appeal to those people . we could have a whole discussion on "" postmodern neomarxism "" and how marxism and postmodernism are contradictory philosophies and how "" cultural marxism "" has its roots in 1930s-40s era anti-semitic fearmongering against the threat of "" cultural bolshevism "" damaging a nation 's culture and wealth . they believe in something they call "" race realism "" , which basically consists of their making the mistake of attributing to race things that are the result of culture , and taking stereotypes too seriously . they have a problem with peterson , in that he wo n't go into the "" jewish question "" , as they put it . i do n't think you can call the media hysteria over that term accidental . not that there is n't any overlap , but being a nazi involves a lot of extra positions not held by the alt-right in general . my favorite peterson page is this , an exhausting/exhaustive list of articles on where peterson is wrong on nearly every topic he opens his mouth on , from lobster anatomy to philosophy ; it is quite impressive . however , despite marx 's personal attempts to continually think deeper , it is undeniable that his texts were open enough to create a permission structure for atrocities ; perhaps , if he had been less forceful with his language , more modest in his prose , then people would not have been militant , violent marxists . peterson , at the very least -- although i would argue he is much worse -- , is in a similar position to marx . the reason i think that peterson is worse than marx is because marx wrote in a time where they were largely ignorant of the unintended effect of leaving text ambiguous : most people were illiterate and there were very few examples of texts ( other than biblical ones ) causing mass violence . peterson bears the responsibility of his followers ( the alt-right ) as long as he is allowing his language to be ambiguous enough to create a permission structure for their beliefs . i see little evidence that he actively does this , so , given the responsibilities of public intellectuals , he is in tacit approval of the alt-right and therefore very close to them , closer than marx is to marxists . he has appeared on prager “ university ” and fox news . his fanbase is mostly right wing and his detractors are mostly left wing . at one point , many of the people claiming to be members of the intellectual dark web proudly called themselves alt-right . but when the ruse by the nazi wing of alt-right was exposed they began distancing themselves . the nazi wing still wants the term alt-right to encompass as many people as possible . so you have a case where people like peterson used to claim to be alt-right and current alt-right people claim that he is alt-right , and detractors benefit from calling him alt-right . it is a pointless argument because everyone gets to use their own definition because the word was designed to intentionally make it impossible to pin anything down . so you can draw as many distinctions between peterson and richard spencer as you want , that does n't prove anything to someone who considers him alt-right because they are using a different definition ."
9tavmy,"government officials should always be available for comment on something that they said and should not be allowed to refuse to do so . ( reposted to change title for clarity ) this was prompted after a couple of articles that i read over the last couple of days , one where the fcc commissioner claimed that communal broadband violates the first amendment and another where sarah huckabee sanders claimed trump won the popular vote despite him losing by millions of votes . the common thread between these articles is that in both cases , neither sanders nor mike o'reilly faced any kind of retribution or questioning over their False statements because , rather conveniently , neither of them were available for comment after they occurred ; sanders called the press briefing to a close and the fcc did n't respond to a request for comment . the fact that they were n't held accountable at all is ridiculous . a government official is n't an athlete or a salesman , they were either elected or appointed by another elected official to serve the interests of the united states and its people . they should n't get to run a pr campaign . they should n't get time to spin what they said into something else . if they make a False or deceptive statement , they should be forcefully compelled to immediately and publicly justify what they said or admit that they were lying and suffer the consequences . there should be nothing shielding these officials from the people that elected them .","as screwed up as this sounds , politicians are n't held to the same standard of truth seeking as the media is . when a newspaper publishes a story that contains inaccurate information , they generally will write a redaction or correction article acknowledging that they were wrong . are all normal rhetoric in politics and they 're often statements that nobody gets held to . the problems with politicians being available to explain their comments is just a small part of the larger misinformation problem we 're facing today . when you think about how things should be , you have to separate that from what should be a rule/law . while i completely agree public official should be as available as possible to answer questions and be transparent , but making that a rule will lead to the abuse of that rule by all parties . for example it 'd be pretty easy to hassle any public official with loaded questions or repeated questions until all the time for a statement is wasted discussing something irrelevant ( this already happens a lot ) . also for a rule like that to exist someone with an agenda is going to need to have the power to say "" you 're not going anywhere , you have to answer that question . "" but if congress passed a law that compelled someone to talk when they did n't want to , where would it stop ? the government should not be able to pass any law that compels speech of any kind from anyone . while i definitely agree that public officials who knowingly mislead the public should face consequences for it , i do n't think that removing the right to refuse comment is the way to do that . there are reasonable and legitimate reasons for government officials not commenting on something they said . just off the top of my head , i can think of things being said where further elaboration would cause a breach of national security , or affect the balance of a delicate on-going negotiation , or reveal personal information or violate the privacy of someone . the issue with sanders and o'reilly is that they think of legitimate reasons not to comment on something as protections against consequences of stupid things/opinions they expressed . i have a bad taste in my mouth thinking of national security as a legitimate reason for government not to be completely transparent . although cumbersome , there are also muitiple mechanism in place for hearings and subpoenas to force further elaboration on a previously issued statement . furthermore , it 's not like these people will never speak to another reporter or never have another press conference again ( it 's sanders ' primary job duty to hold press briefings ) , so they can be called out on their comments at any time , should the american people not lose interest or get distracted by the latest celebrity gossip . i think drastically changing the nature of government , to deal with stupid comments like this by sarah huckabee sanders is like trying to kill a fly with a shotgun . the better solution is to not elect people who clearly seem like they 'll appoint people who 'll say and do stuff like this . top government officials employ people to help them understand data and public opinion , and to help them make decisions . i do n’t think you can reasonably expect an official to be able to immediately provide comments or context on demand without consulting with their team to better understand the details on which a certain statement or decision was based . what if it ’s a good government official , and they were wrong , but a system of “ immediate comment ” backs them into a position of doubling down based on what they currently know , since we denied them the opportunity to double check their facts ? i ’d agree with a more nuanced proposition that government officials should be required to provide comment with some notice ."
9tal8v,"pregnant women should be institutionalized pregnancy is a very sensitive period for prenatal development . there are many things women should do , or abstain from doing , to maximize the health of their child . however , statistics reveal that women do not fulfill these obligations . for example : - alcohol is a major cause of microcephaly , ataxia , cognitive impairment and stillbirth . despite this , "" we estimate that globally , on average , one in 10 women consumes alcohol during pregnancy and 20 % of these women binge drink "" ( source ) . the numbers are highest for ireland ( 60 % ) and uk ( 40 % ) . - tobacco is a cause of sudden infant death syndrome , heart defects , clubfoot , gastroschisis and tic disorders . despite this , "" approximately 10 % of women reported smoking during the last 3 months of pregnancy "" ( source ) . - folic acid is a recommended supplement to reduce the risk of neural tube defects . despite this , "" the recent evidence that only 28 % of pregnant women in england in 2012 took folic acid supplements at the correct time indicates that , in practice , recommending folic acid supplementation is largely ineffective "" ( source ) . - choline is a supplement shown to improve cognitive ability and reduce the risk of schizophrenia . despite this , "" mean choline intakes for older children , men , women and pregnant women are far below the adequate intake established by the iom "" ( source ) . - omega-3 is a supplement shown to improve cognitive ability and reduce the risk of premature birth . despite this , "" our findings from these nhanes surveys indicate only 1.8 % of non-pregnant and 9.0 % of pregnant women took supplements containing epa and/or dha "" ( source ) . to correct these shortcomings , i believe pregnant women should be institutionalized for 9 months . the institution will provide supplements , nutritious diet , exercise , guided meditation , health checkups , etc at the tax-payers expense ( paid for by a compensatory reduction in birth defects ) . cmv .","rounding up pregnant women for 9 months because some do harmful behaviors is a horrific idea . the woman has the full right to decide what she does with her body . there would not be anywhere near enough room at hospitals or other healthcare facilities for every single pregnant woman to be locked up for the full pregnancy . the cost for equipment , for the needed increase in staff , and for the women to eat would be astronomical - and theres no way to distribute that cost in a way that 's both fair and affordable . now they are held back , simply because some people did n't make the same good decisions ? this also establishes a situation in which women are ( even more ) demonized for pregnancies than men are . you both consented to a decision which could likely lead to pregnancy ; however , we 've decided that - due to 10-20 % of cases - all women must not only carry the burden of fostering a pregnancy , but also be institutionalized - separated from their friends , family , loved ones , other children - while the men go about their merry way . 23 % of children in the united states live with single mothers ... so should we institutionalize that 23 % of men who - for whatever reasons , valid or not - abandon their children ? as another user already pointed out , legislating policy to forcibly institutionalize all pregnant women is a pandora 's box that we should not want to open . i 'm not saying that it 's not significant at all , but it 's not significant enough to justify drastically impacting the lives of millions of women . or how about the bad things a guy can do that affects his sperm , should we just lock up all men that are planning on having children in the future too ? if you want the birthrate to severely drop and for the vast majority of pregnancies to end in abortion , then this is a great policy . most women would not want to give birth to children if it means locking themselves up for 9 months , and would prefer to adopt . your statistics show that a minority of women should maybe institutionalized ( alcohol and tobacco ) . your view implies that most women need to be institutionalized . even if there was some good reason to ensure optimal child health ( say , 95 % of us die off and extreme measures are on the table to ensure humanity is not wiped out forever ) : are n't you just creating a monoculture with a policy like this ? then we find out that any kid whos mom took this has a much higher chance of some neural condition in their 30s . now an entire generation of kids is screwed because we thought we knew what was best and forced it on 100 % of the pregnant population . secondly , if you institutionalize pregnant people for nine months , you are creating a massive stressor ( remember that stress is bad for pregnancies too ) by taking them away from everything familiar to them . their partners are going to be effectively partnerless for the duration of the pregnancy ; this will potentially destroy relationships . the stress level and overall well being of a mother have a huuuuuge effect on the health of the fetus . essentially imprisoning women during their pregnancy , regardless of how well you treat them is going to have a disastrous effect on their mental health and that rise in their stress level is going to be more damaging to all the fetuses anyone is carrying verses the small number whose mother ’s use illicit substances treating all pregnant women like criminals does n't even make a little sense . stress hormones are shown to have a negative effect on fetal development - everything from slow development after birth to full miscarriage and a myriad of issues in between can be caused by elevated stress levels during pregnancy . besides , how many women do you think will want to get pregnant , if they know they 'll be forced into some closed institution for 9 months ? being pregnant is n't a medical disorder and does not warrant going to a mental health ward . we can not force supplements on pregnant women , even if they are being treated for substance abuse disorders . to avoid being institutionalized , women would simply hide their pregnancy until the late stages . by then most of the damage has been done , and they have avoided prenatal checkups to boot ."
9tafrk,"punishments for drink driving should be the same , whether you kill or not . in my opinion , people who drink and drive should get similar punishments regardless of the outcome . people who kill someone because they were drunk did not intend for this to happen , and they took exactly the same actions , and had exactly the same thoughts as someone who did not kill someone . we punish people because we believe they have done something immoral , to stop them doing it again and to keep society safe from them . whether they kill someone or not does not have any influence on these things . note , i am making no comment on which way this should go ; drunk drivers getting more or people who kill drunk drivers getting less . what ’s your opinion ?","that punishment aspect should be the same regardless of if you hit someone or something i agree . but hitting someone or something are separate crimes on their own . those separate crimes deserve separate punishments and so if you punish all drunk drivers the same as those that kill while driving drunk that means you are never punishing those that kill while driving drunk . there are tons of reasons why one drunk driver is n't just as likely to kill someone as another : maybe one has a much higher alcohol blood level than the other ( okay , this one it probably makes sense to calibrate the punishment to alcohol blood level ) . maybe some drivers really do have a better ability to drive drunk or through their intentions are intentionally driving more cautiously or intentionally driving more recklessly . some of the drivers are driving in less populated areas or areas without pedestrians . some drivers are driving lighter vehicles ( t-boning another car is n't going to do as much damage with a lighter vehicle ) . we need to consider their actual chance of killing someone , after all , even driving sober has a chance of killing someone . there are reasons why they might have not killed someone and another drunk driver did , it is n't pure chance , though chance is a part of it . punishment should have the same minimum , but if you kill someone , you should still get a higher punishment . so id suggest that instead of using all the money we ’d use prosecuting and locking up each and every drunk driver we find ( and we tend to only find them when they crash and hurt someone anyway ) we use that money to put some more traffic cops on the beat , maybe have some more check points and do other things to increase the frequency we arrest people . we do n’t fine all dog owners for the risk of owning dogs . if i become intoxicated and fall through a plate glass window , i have to pay — we should not fine all drunk people equally for the extra risk to property damage they create . because if we fined all dog owners and drunks equally , then the dog owner has no incentive to prevent their dog from biting , and once the drunk becomes drunk , there is no incentive to stop them from jumping through plate glass windows . a major problem with your rule change is that as soon as one gets behind the wheel drunk , there is less incentive to be careful , as the punishment will be the same whether you kill anyone or not . i think its also telling that you can not decide whether your view should mean that we punish all drunk drivers more or less . if two oil companies cut the same corners , but one creates a huge oil spill and the other creates a very small one , each one should be responsible for cleaning up all the oil they spilled , even though the same bad action led to two disparate results . justice isnt just about deterring bad actions , but about the clean-up of the bad consequences of actions . the second gives liability for a bad result of that action . when you kill someone ( for example ) while drunk driving you have committed two crimes - driving under the influence and involuntary manslaughter . when you 're only drunk driving you 're committing one crime - driving under the influence . driving while intoxicated and vehicular homicide are actually two different charges . so if the driver kills someone or not their receive the charge "" driving while intoxicated "" and if they kill someone then it 's either "" vehicular homicide "" or "" vehicular manslaughter "" also generally speaking a sentence is not a punishment , it 's how a person pays their debt to society , i.e. to make society whole for what they did , so you could argue if a person fell asleep in their car with the key in the ignition ( you can be charged with driving while intoxicated for doing that . ) one could say that both drivers decided to take part in a "" lottery "" while aware of the possible consequences ( punishment ) that they would receive if they got into severe enough accidents . through this lottery , most will get out scot-free ( or with a minor punishment ) , while some will be punished for killing someone . even though there are also many ( yet statistically less probable ) examples of people who never got lung cancer , yet who smoked the same number ( or more ) of cigarettes a day . we ’re fortunate that alcohol has a measure , but cvs should be held accountable if i ’m getting my oxy through the drive-thru . drink driving is a punishment based on risk alone until you kill or hurt someone . that is , you are being punished because you have an elevated risk of hurting someone , not actually doing it . assuming by your use of "" drink driving "" and not "" drunk driving "" that you are in a commonwealth country , where it is hard to purchase a gun legally . the thinking is that owning a gun is illegal because owning one increases your risk of shooting someone . by the same logic applied to drink/drunk driving , would you say that owning an illegal gun should be punished the same way as actually murdering someone ? someone already on the hook for drunk driving has an incentive to stop and reconsider before they kill someone . but if every drunk driver is legally identical to a drunk driver who 's killed someone , then doing whatever it takes not to get caught , including actually killing someone , comes at no extra cost ."
9ta9q0,"' freedom to ' is more important than ' freedom from ' to clarify what i mean in the subject - examples of ' freedom to ' include ' freedom to live in any country of your choosing ' , ' freedom to work in the industry that you choose ' or ' freedom to pursue education matching your talents and ambitions ' . examples of ' freedom from ' are things like ' freedom from the government ' , ' freedom from taxation ' , ' freedom from foreigners ' . & #x200b ; now , onto my rationale : in my personal view , the most important things in life that we should all strive towards , apart from the basic human rights , is equality of opportunity and freedom of movement . we live in an ever more globalised world where social boundaries , as well as country borders , have less and less meaning . as a result , we should strive to allow people to seize the opportunities that they otherwise would n't be allowed to have because they were born in the wrong country , wrong family or with the wrong gender . ' freedom to ' is important because it helps people achieve their goals in life . & #x200b ; ' freedom from ' , on the other hand , can be a short-sighted outlook on life in mild cases and a bigoted one in extreme scenarios . the government is n't out to get you . foreigners are not inherently worse than locals . taxes are not evil ; they are part of a social contract that allows your society to have nice things . clinging to ' freedom from ' can lead to egoism , nationalism and tribalism .","' freedom from being told which country you must live ' and ' freedom to live in any country of your choosing ' mean the same thing , but one is a ' freedom from ' and one is a ' freedom to ' ' freedom from taxation ' could be expressed as ' freedom to keep all of the money you earn ' or ' freedom to decide where all of your money is spent ' ' freedom from foreigners ' becomes ' freedom to be safe in your home land ' freedom from government would depend on what specific part of the government you 're talking of being free from , but i 'm sure it could be expressed as a freedom to do something without government intervention freedom to move anywhere , is freedom from immigration controls , freedom to work in the industry and position you choose is freedom from forced labor . freedom from foreigners is freedom to choose who you associate with . whilst i agree with the general premise i disagree with it on a global scale as i think most people would have a desire to leave what we call 3rd world countries in mass to countries like the u.s canada , u.k sweden , etc. etc. due to the obvious shot at a greater chance of success in life in these places thus making the previously mentioned areas far over populated and the 3rd world areas with little to no innovation as is due to the majority of people abandoning those areas for opportunities the country is not forced to grant me anything though . most freedoms tend to treads on someone else 's freedom , so i agree that we have to draw the line somewhere , but i do n't think you can use such a simplistic evaluation since we have tons of freedom froms . personal freedoms can generally be viewed from a different angle as treading on someone else 's freedoms to take away your personal freedoms , and i generally believe in personal freedoms , but there are lots of lines we draw around those personal freedoms , such as the above . the central focus of "" freedom from "" is "" freedom from coercion "" - meaning you should be free from being coerced to do anything you do n't want to do - thus allowing you to be free to pursue your self interest . as long as you are free from coercion , then you are free to do as you please ( insofar as you do not infringe on anyone else 's rights ) . sure , you are free to pursue your interests - and any services you 'd like to acquire are given to you through consent ( i.e . most of what you vouch for are known as positive rights , which are things that require something to be fufilled . the inverse , negative rights , are things that do n't require outside intervention to have . the issue with positive rights is that they require force to ensure ."
9t99iz,"person-centric reporting is not beneficial to overarching dialogue and fixing problems . to be clear what i am talking about is when organizations make claims that "" x percent of people in situation y are suffering from this . here is one ( or two ) person 's story . "" these generally detract from the facts of the overarching issue as the reporters can easily cherry pick a person that says what needs to be done is what the reporter agrees with . to be clear , i do understand that this is done because people pay more attention to it . i still believe that it ends up harming healthy debate and it hinders fixing problems as it makes people latch onto the story of one individual instead of looking at the problem as a whole . after all what might fix that individual 's problems might not fix 80 % of the other people 's problems , affected by ' y ' . reporting should focus less on personal stories and more on the ideas and events that occur . if the story literally is about one person this is definitely fine , like a person was shot , or a person has won some major reward , or a person started a major protest . my problem is when reporters draw a False line between a single person 's story and an overarching event or theme .","although we can logically understand the crushing devastation implied by a figure like "" 80 % of homes damaged or destroyed "" , many will struggle to develop a strong emotional connection to this data . when we have an individual story to directly empathize with , potentially allowing us to imagine ourselves in that same situation , it makes the story more personal to the person hearing it . as a result , that listener/reader may feel more inclined to take action or bring the topic up for discussion with others , which can be particularly helpful when it comes to events where immediate action is needed . secondly , providing personal stories can help individualize people who are otherwise made monolithic when only looked at through the lens of statistics or hard data . this can be really important for a story , as it helps to ward off stereotyping of groups being reported upon , and helps readers/viewers to avoid overgeneralizing the solution to any given problem . as an example of this second utility , imagine a news outlet runs a story on a town where unemployment has spiked to 50 % in the year after a local factory closed to move overseas . furthermore , readers/viewers might make sweeping characterizations of the actors involved in this story , like assuming the workers were foolish for not recognizing their jobs were precarious . however , once we add personal stories into the mix , we can get a more nuanced understanding of the problem at hand . maybe the workers did know they were about to lose their jobs , but their town lacked the public transportation needed to get them to alternate workplaces . maybe the factory owner felt tortured by the choice to move their location , but realized they would go bankrupt if they did n't do so . maybe some of the workers will share that re-education is their biggest need for getting back to work , while others will share that years of labor in the factory left them with health issues that make other jobs hard . by simply gaining individual perspectives on this story , we can quickly show the complexity underlying a given problem , which is otherwise made invisible when we only look at the hard numbers . having a healthy debate that finds agreeable conclusions about a story may not accomplish anything if people do n't care . we know not enough is being done to fix the problem . telling people that on the news does n't change anything . commercials that introduce an audience to individual suffering children and asking for help generates millions of dollars for aid and relief . it does n't "" fix "" the problem either , but it helps more than debate . let 's say you operate a sales business with 50 sales people . showing them charts and spreadsheets with data logically showing how much revenue is needed to meet company goals and achieve growth is not as effective as showing them how much bonus the top individual sales people made and the cool new car they got . you are far more likely to pique the interest of most individuals by telling them a relatable story about another individual . we could have reporting about x number of children diagnosed every year with autism , and a list of common symptoms , but unless they showed you a few more in depth portrayals of actual kids and families , you ’re unlikely to understand what the numbers mean or why they matter . this leaves out a crucial piece of information which is what it is like to suffer from z. most people only have the experience of their family , friends , and other close contacts to draw on . "" 3 % of syria 's population died in the syrian civil war "" ( actual stat ) is a sterile fact that gives you no sense of how they died , and "" 5 % of syria 's population had a limb blown off "" does n't really give you a sense of what it is like to have a limb blown off in war and live with it ( my wild guess ) . statistics are inherently abstract and by necessity involve squishing lots of information down to single dimension measures . individual stories are ways of taking the abstract and simplified information of a statistic and making them more concrete and adding back some of the lost richness . she missed her court appearance while she was working late . actually , in the state where maria lives , it 's illegal to fire someone because of a court appearance . "" "" experts estimate that professional obligations like maria 's account for 25 % of all missed court apperances . "" statistics are just one kind of storytelling technique , and should be utilized alongside others to make whatever point you 're hoping to make . ex : let 's say i am vehemently opposed to spending tax money on cancer research . i may believe that the free market is perfectly capable of filling that demand , or anything else . one day , i am sitting there watching cable news , and the reporters say ' 25 % of all deaths in the united states are from cancer . ' when i am shown specific examples of people who have been helped by government-funded cancer research , i am more likely to change my view on the subject . there has been a healthy debate on racism , yet there are still racists . this is the strategy that the television stories of which you speak employ . their sole goal is using True information to change people 's minds in a way they perceive to be good ."
9t6hlx,"voting is terrifying i have no idea where this post should go , but i want to reach people who have some interest/knowledge about politics , so i ’m trying here . please let me know if i should post somewhere else . i ’m a 17y/o american who plans to vote as soon as she gets the chance , but i am terrified of making the wrong decision . if i ’ve had close friends for years who ended up being back-stabbers out of nowhere , how am i supposed to trust a dude i ’ve never met before to take care of me , my country , and everything i love ? a dude who is purposefully modifying his/her information to appear to the public in a certain way ? it does n’t help that history has always been my worst subject . i am all for having a growth mindset ( that ’s why i ’m here in the first place ) , but i ca n’t get over how much of a responsibility voting is . either i ’m ridiculously ignorant , or everyone around me pretends to know what they ’re talking about more than they actually know what they ’re talking about . there ’s so much to think about ; even if i somehow know who i like , how do i know when i should vote for my second choice because they ’re better than my 3rd choice and i know my first choice wo n’t win ? and the media is full of misleading information ; where do i look for the real juicy details ? how the heck do i make this decision ? how can i read between the lines to figure out what the long-term impact of a politician ’s plan would be on the economy , for example ? i want my vote to be the right one . voting is terrifying , please change my view so that i do n’t chicken out . i really want to vote , but i want to vote correctly .","most people vote on gut feelings , a few people actually know what 's going on . second , as you get older you realize most people are pretty complicated and have to make decisions in the face of complications . if somebody i vote for has to do a bad thing because it helps them do a good thing , i just hope they use all their wisdom and judgement to make the right decision . if you vote in every election , then by the time you 're 50 you will have voted in at least 25 elections . whatever bad decisions they might make might be canceled out by a decision made by someone you did n't vote for . i do n't know a lot about some of those , especially all the judges and justices , but i do know something about most of them , and i also know they 've been vetted and approved by the party that aligns with most of my key issues . i know people in that party locally , and i trust them , and so i trust the people they work for even if i do n't know them . i also know that their opponents have been vetted and approved by the other party , which i do n't trust because i 've seen the kind of people they 've brought forth , and i do n't agree with their positions on most issues anyway . you could vote for third parties if you ca n't deal with voting for the two major parties . mathematically , your vote has an essentially zero chance of changing the outcome of any election you participate in , so really there 's nothing to be terrified of . you seem to place a lot of emphasis on candidates , which make up the majority of ballot decisions , however there are also local/state issues that show up like bonds . i 've voted in every election for over 20 years . i 've voted for republicans , democrats , independents , and for an against various ballot and bond initiatives . the most important votes you will cast will likely be for your local offices and judges , and it is usually much easier to obtain information about these from your local news , or even better , meeting these candidates at various functions . the best advice i can give is do n't feel pressured to vote for any office or issue if you do n't feel informed enough to make a reasonable determination of your own opinion , but vote for those that you feel passionately about , or feel informed enough to have an opinion . it may be that that $ 50 million in school bonds is a no brainer for you , but who should be town dog catcher is n't , and you do n't have to vote for every single race or ballot issue . on the other hand , i am an attorney and have certain very strong legal opinions on things like the death penalty , mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines , and drug law enforcement . additionally , certain laws in my state directly impact my law practice and i do vote for state politicians that are not trying to take my livelihood away . figure out what is personally important to you at this stage of your life , maybe its pending student loans or other post-high school education and training opportunities , maybe school funding for a extracurricular activity you 've enjoyed is being debated , seeing as it is unlikely you have a career-track , salaried job right now , tax reform is probably not going to impact you as much right now so let your self worry about that down the road . there is no escape from the bubbles we live in but there is little reason your opinion is less valid than those who proudly and ignorantly push forward with their ideas . my opinion is n't any more valid than yours and our ideas should compete or compliment each other in the ballot box . if you are a part of a group pushing something conventionally dangerous and stupid ( like brexit ) , then the responsibility does n't lie solely with you . by not voting , you take a vote away from something that you may see as decent . those politicians and ideas need your support if they ever hope to make the world better . you should n’t have first or second or third choices when going to vote . if you ’re all for continued pollution and overall nonsense you know who to vote for . whoever you are voting for ( assuming it is a national election ) is part of a large system of checks and balances we have put in place so that one individual can not run around and do absolutely whatever he or she pleases . much to this end , the individual you are voting for is a relative embodiment of an idea . liberals tend to be more future oriented in their decision making and look to alternative solutions and changing the institutions already in place . find sources that are conservative and sources that are liberal and listen to both sides of the story . find the people that truly believe they can help their fellow citizens and you will be better informed than almost 95 % of individuals who vote . that should not scare you , however , it should simply remind you that the political system is a constant work in progress and being part of that change is your most important contribution you can have as an american citizen . i do n't think you should ever vote for your second or third choice , unless you simply ca n't ( because they dropped out , or lost a primary or something ) . do n't make the mistake of voting for someone else , just because you think your first choice wo n't win the overall election . if you ca n't make a decision to vote yes or no on some tax or new law ... it 's probably best to just vote no . when you do vote ... it 's ok to leave certain issues blank . ok , figuring out who to vote for is relatively straightforward ( though not always easy ) . while they often exaggerate specifics or claim credit when they do n't deserve it , politicians generally actually try to do what they say they 're going to do . if they do n't meet those claims , you ( and others ) can recognize that and hold them accountable by voting them out next cycle . as for determining whether to vote for your 2nd choice candidate over your first , this is called strategic voting . you can google "" \ [ candidate x \ ] vs \ [ candidate y \ ] polls "" or "" \ [ state \ ] polls "" , or visit fivethirtyeight to get a read on the polls if it 's 2 candidates ( a dem and a gop candidate ) , either one is a viable choice since either will be polling with decent support . they have little chance to win , but they will splinter off a bit of the vote from one of the other candidates and likely act as a spoiler . your individual vote really does not matter , you will not be deciding an election but instead being a part of that election , part of the process . voting is n't the sum total of politics and one election is n't the be-all end-all . the first thing is to view voting as a long-term project . many other decisions in life are like this : romantic , economic , life choices , etc . you can decide on who to vote for by ranking how well the politicians address and provide good evidence that they are trustworthy or at least reasonable in trying to find solutions to real problems in the world ."

"" but this begs the question - which way is the logic going ? was it already obvious to black people that the police are shooting them disproportionately , and therefore the nyt is simply raising awareness/justified in cherry picking anecdotes ? or on the other hand , are people perceiving there to be an epidemic because of the cherry picked anecdotes ? honestly , to me , the latter seems more realistic . given my social circles , this is not an easy position to take from a reputational/social norms perspective . but from my logical , objective reasoning , the evidence seems to support it . plenty of white people are shot by the police and we simply do n't hear about it . if the nyt ( and other mainstream media ) reported every case equally ( stating the race of the officer and person shot for every single police shooting ) i believe that public perception would not be what it is . i have been told that i need to "" talk to black people , "" and i find it to be incredibly worrying that people like me are dismissed as ignorant , or duh duh duh .... right wingers . looking at the numbers , the average black person does n't know anybody who 's been shot by the cops . people in florida are 4 times more likely than people in new york to be shot by the police . that 's because there are more guns and violent crime in general in florida . but it still remains incredibly unlikely . it seem inevitable that the black people i 'm told i need to talk to , who will tell me that they 're more likely to be shot by the cops , are getting this impression from the media , not from their lived experience . i 'm seeing the same media as they are , and therefore my opinion is equally as valid . this is n't to say that black people do n't experience racism of any kind , i admit to being ignorant of what it 's like to be black . but i also see a narrative being dishonestly pushed around the shootings specifically . i think that a lot of intelligent people with good critical thinking skills see what i 'm seeing and it 's a damn shame that these people are dismissed as right wingers or not "" getting it "" . cmv","you do n't cite a single source and seem to only speculate on how your opinion differs from your friends . i think it is reasonable to say that it is possible that the media is pushing a narrative that is n't True . this is n't a fair point as black folk make up significantly less of the population to white folk . based on data here , 318 white folk and 159 black folk were shot by police in 2018 . based on the distribution of race found here , we would expect the percentages to match up if race was n't a factor . of non-hispanic white folk in us vs 39.70 % of non-hispanic white folk shot by police -12.38 % pop of black folk in us vs 19.85 % of black folk shot by police i ’d place being shot by police at the far end of the spectrum of bad outcomes possible when a black person is dealing with police . there 's lots you can do besides talking to black people . bpd officers disproportionately stop african americans ; search them more frequently african americans are likewise subjected more often to False arrests . dismissed a higher proportion of african-american arrests upon initial review compared to arrests excessive force incidents identified by the justice department review involve force used against there 's tons more in this one , but another nugget that addresses a common suggestion that cops spend more time in black neighborhoods due to the crime rate : but to be honest , shooting is just the tragic result of letting this kind of thing take root in police departments . and a fatal shooting is so terribly irreversible that it 's going to stoke more outrage than being handcuffed or roughed up ."
9t4d37,"the way facebook , google and other tech megacorporations control speech on their platform limits free/effective speech in the world today let me start by saying that i am totally aware that private companies are legally allowed to choose what is and is n't allowed on their platform . the internet has undoubtedly changed how we communicate with each other , connecting us in ways we never thought possible . however , as the wild west days of the internet fade behind us , we have entered a world where speech is increasingly being controlled by megacorporations like facebook , twitter , google and others who now have become major channels for the expression and discover of our ideas today . these companies effectively control vast amounts of the flow of information in the world , and as the climate continues to polarize , we are now facing serious problems with our situation . these private companies have already begun using their platforms to determine which voices are worth listening too , and deplatforming or soft-censoring voices they do n't like . here are my main problems with this situation : the private aspect means that a small group of individuals can decide based on their own personal biases or preferences what voices are heard , distorting the flow of speech to their own benefit , or others detriment further , political biases at these companies tend to lean left , resulting in voices that oppose or disagree with such ideologies being , at best , potentially underrepresented in the public conversation • at worst , disliked ideas can be branded as "" hate speech "" or similarly nebulous terms , and banned on platforms without evidence or warning , all on the whim of of a mouseclick . sometimes this happens in tandem at multiple companies , forcing someone off multiple platforms at once the monopolistic nature of these companies also means that competing platforms can essentially be muscled out by the big guys cooperation with world governments without civilian oversight means that government censorship is also an increasing threat without proper tools to deal with it the end result is that free/effective speech is at severe risk of being censored by private companies at the behest of everyone but the people it actually matters for . • left wing ideologies are also at risk here , because if these tech giants can censor peoe they do n't like , they can censor people they like , too .","with social media today , the common man has a much better "" microphone "" then at any point in the past . your words can easily reach a lot of people if your words are interesting enough . google can suppress you on reddit or 4chan , and those avenues are better then what you had 10 , 20 , or 30 years ago . these companies can use their platforms to influence which voices seem worth listening to , but only to those who make the mistake of judging whether something is worth listening to based on popularity and/or visibility online . however , of the examples i 'm aware of , it is because of the public pressuring them that they have directly targeted ' high profile ' individuals for their speech online . so the company did n't solely determine what voices are worth listening to serve a particular agenda of their own , they only reacted to enough people who made a case that these people should n't have such a platform . they do not have that much control over who becomes popular , they may give advantages to some people but they have to at least interest / entertain people enough to become a significant pop phenomenon of whatever sort . hate speech is n't nebulous , though people 's interpretations of the word can be and like anything people may quibble over definitions or where lines are drawn . regardless , it is reasonable to remove people whose speech is harmful due to inciting people , especially on such large platforms that reach the less well educated population ( and i do n't mean formal ) that can be incited by nonsense quite easily . they still can privately express themselves to people who care to listen to them , freedom of speech should never guarantee a person the right to use a forum of any sort . people unwilling to search out the viewpoints of both sides of the arguments and unaware of the biases in their information sources are going to be influenced by biased media no matter what you do ; i think the only real solution is for the consumers to take action and treat companies that disseminate and control information with suspicion . and this is going to be a problem even without the companies themselves having bias in what they censor ; it 's already far too easy to surround yourself with pages , followers , media sources etc that share your views . facebook did n't do enough to stop hate speech in myanmar . as you 've said , centralizing speech platforms has risks , too . for the most part , i think social media companies are adopting reasonable content policies . developing a new social media platform is relatively cheap ( attracting users is more difficult ) ."

9t44lt,"early voting ballots are inherently in a lower tier classification and are more subject to not being counted properly first , i am fully committed to voting on november 6th ! this is not a "" i do n't want to vote "" post . i will vote . secondly , this is probably more of a paranoia , based on a lack of understanding , rather than an opinion but all the same i 'd like you to change my view . i ca n't shake this weird feeling that , if i truly want my vote to matter , i must wait and vote specifically on election day - not before . the designation of a single official "" election day "" to me signifies one day as being more "" correct "" and therefore votes cast on that day more "" official "" . i understand the benefits of providing citizens with an early voting period , but it seems to beg the question : why not simply replace election day with , for example , election month ? until this happens , there is a symbolic distinction between voting on election day versus some arbitrary day before election day . as a result i just have this fear that early vote ballots might somehow "" get lost "" somewhere , misplaced in a "" closet "" or on some secondary database whose security and legitimacy are n't given the same gravitas and/or respect as the ones cast on election day . for instance , why are early vote ballots not counted and results published ? people have been voting for a couple weeks now , and i think we should already know the current status of the races . but because this information is n't determined and released until election day it just seems ... suspicious . not only that , but i feel like election day is a major american tradition and participation is such a civic duty , and as such the decision to vote on "" some other day "" is kind of a contrarian or protest statement that i do n't intend to make , as it signifies "" voting on the correct day "" is not important to me and i just want to "" get it over with "" . please put my mind at ease , and maybe i will be willing to early vote in 2020 !","so , i do n't like early voting for a number of reasons , but none of them are related to what you stated . vote by mail and early voting are entirely safe processes and ballots are locked . in many jurisdictions , you can go online to confirm your ballot was indeed "" received "" by the elections officers , meaning counted . you ca n't see who you voted for , but you can see that your ballot got counted , but you wo n't see that until after the polls close . regardless if you use scannable paper ballots or you use electronic voting , the votes are not counted until the precincts close , and the precinct does n't "" close "" until all votes have been cast , even if the ' polling place ' closes to more people entering the line . so if a precinct has a line , poll closes at 8 pm but it takes until 10 to get everyone through , then the precinct wo n't even start counting until after that last person votes . even if the "" count "" has been done the entire time by machine , the election judge has to "" close "" the polling place , by certifying there are no more ballots to be cast , that they are indeed done , and are locking the books . i do agree with you more people should vote on election day , and in person . the reason for that is when people do n't show up to their polling places , they close polling places , which hurts people 's ability to vote , especially the poor , disabled , visually impaired , people who require close polling places with accessible technology . if everyone votes by mail or votes early , then the counties and states have reason to close polling places due to lack of attendance . i work for the supervisor of elections in my city , so while i ca n't talk about every city , i can about mine . there 's no difference in how early voting and election day ballots are counted . the voter is checked in through an electronic voter identification machine ( evids ) , which produce both an electronic and paper trail . then the voter inserts their ballot into a tabulator , which stores and counts the vote , both electronically and physically ( and we have a demonstration of all the machines open to the public before the election ) , and at the end of the day are placed into a bag , which is sealed . we pick up the bags and check each of them , make sure the paper work is right , and store them . in the event of a recount we have every single ballot on hand . i 've served as an election judge before and i can guarantee that ( at least in my county ) all of the early votes were counted . results from early voting are n't published in advance of election day because that would sway later voters . no ballots are scored until the polls close , whether it 's early ballots or election day ballots . the results you see on election day are from exit polls , not the ballots themselves ."
9t40cd,"i am better than you because i am vegan vegans are better people than meat eaters , for a couple of reasons that i will get to . i 'd just like to start of by saying that there are exceptions of course , such as people outside of first-world countries with poor accessibility to a vegan lifestyle , or people with specific dietary needs , etc . but in general - if you live in the first world and you are a regular meat eater - you are living an immoral lifestyle . here are the reasons : you do not require meat : this is the most important point , so i 'm starting off with it . you can - like vegans do - make replacements for the dietary needs meat fulfills in the form of vegan food and/or supplements . taking supplements is frowned upon for some reason , even though they fill the exact same function as meat in this case . it 's not unhealthy to take supplements , in fact , they put less strain on your system than consuming meat does . science has provided us with a way to take meat off our diet without suffering any consequences , so considering the downsides of meat , what reason is there not to do it ? so what are the negative aspects of meat then ? greenhouse gas emissions : animal agriculture is responsible for 14-18 percent of the worlds greenhouse gas emissions ( source ) . that makes it the worlds third biggest contributor to emissions , under fossil fuels and deforestation . i originally learned this from watching the documentary "" cowspiracy . "" along with greenhouse gas emissions , meat production also has several other harmful effects on the environment , read more here . abuse of antibiotics : i do n't know much about this topic , so feel free to expand on this if you have deeper knowledge , but as i understand it bacteria develop antibiotic resistances the more we use it . in the us , over 2 million people are diagnosed with antibiotic-resistant infections and over 23,000 die per year due to resistant infections ( source ) . animal agriculture is behind 90 % of antibiotic use ( source ) . kurzgesagt has a great video on this topic . the right to live : this is the classic argument that you 've already heard a million times . life has value , most of us believe that . without life , the universe would be like the most fascinating book ever written with no one to read it . maybe you only believe that human life has value and animal life does n't . but if you think the lives of animals has value , then taking that life from them is immoral - especially when you have no need to . so why would you still eat meat now that you know all this ? there are only two reasons : meat is delicious , and making a change to your lifestyle takes a lot of effort . both of those reasons are grounded in selfishness and laziness . they 're not excuses to continue harming the environment , the people around you , and the lives of the animals you consume . if you choose to continue eating meat after this , then that is an immoral choice . change my view .","- vehicle exhaust accounted for 28 % of us greenhouse gas emissions in 2016 on average a vegan 's body has less vitamins b-12 and d , calcium , iron , zinc and omega-3 acids when compared to a person eating a healthy omnivore diet ( that is recommended by a vast majority of dieticians ) . from what i understand , your main claim is that people who eat meat are immoral because if only a and b were True , would you still hold the position that eating meat is immoral , and if so can you elaborate on that claim ? now , arguing in a religious sense , god made animals for the reason of humans consuming them . regarding agricultural greenhouse gas emissions : as you believe animals such as cattle have an intrinsic right to life ( and i 'm assuming , a decent quality of life ) , how would you propose removing the gases they emit ? dairy cows continue to live when they 're not being milked , and they will still require care until the end of their lives , as would the bulls and bullocks that would be used for breeding and beef . if everyone were to go vegan immediately , the cattle would still exist and their emissions would continue at least until 2030 . if they did n't have an intrinsic right to life , the argument would be to remove their emissions through humane culling , which i assume you do n't agree with ( nor do i ) . i think that there are meat eaters who have n't had the case made to them that the consumption of animal products is immoral . thousands of animals die to cultivate farms , cut up by factory equipment , killed via farm land forcing them out , etc . now that you 're aware of it , if you consciously ignore it or say "" well it could be worse "" , how is that different than a person who chooses merely to eat less meat as opposed to none ? one large contribution to human intelligence ( that separated us from chimpanzees ) was because of the energy we received from eating meat . many herbivore mammals , such as pandas , spend upwards of 70 % of their day eating food . humans eating meat was a huge evolutionary advantage that gave us intelligence . realize we should n't be eating animals ( and it 'd be more obvious if we were smarter as a species ) be able to get our energy from non-animal products given further intelligence so your moral superiority is based in the idea that avoiding causing harm to living things is moral , and i think most people would agree . but i would amend that most people are actually only concerned with unnecessary harm - they 're only interested in avoiding it if it does n't cost them too much . now the thing is , while i think some meat-eaters probably do n't care at all about animals ' suffering - and i would only be against unnecessary suffering - for most it 's ignorance and the fact they 're more concerned with other things . you said yourself that different levels of consciousness have different degrees of value , and i think it 's reasonable to say that there are other humanitarian issues to pursue that would have a greater overall amount of impact on the overall quality of life on earth . how do you think they make all of these special vegan foods and oils . and you say you do n’t eat meat because you value life . my father is a zookeeper and he is n’t vegan and zoos can save animals and have saved some from going extinct . are you better than the soldiers fighting to defend their countries and make it so people can have rights and choices . but they eat meat right you felt bad for an animal so now you are above everyone . i have no problem with vegans i have a problem with entitled snot nosed jerks who think they are better than everyone else plants are alive too pretty sure i 've seen studies that show they experience things like pain too so why is eating plants but not animals ok ? animals eat other animals animals do bad things to other animals too . just starting a car spews pollution in the air which harms others . just going outside of your house is immoral because you are placing potential harms upon other people . now we 're back to your claim of an animal 's right to life , which seems to rely on the assumption that the lives of all animals have intrinsic value . why should the life of a deer have any value to me beyond its value as a source of protein and fat ? you may be making a moral choice by being a vegan , but that 's more than made up for by being smugly superior about it . i eat meat and honey , drink milk and eat cheese and yogurt , not because i enjoy them , but because i recognize the fact that humanity has selectively bred these creatures to a point that they are no longer able to survive without the assistance of man . honey is not vegan , yet you can have a plant based diet with animal products like honey without causing any of the issues that you mentioned . how many animals do you think were killed or displaced by mining the materials used to make the device you typed this on ? if i had to hunt my own food , i 'd be a vegan today , but the fact is what i eat is already killed and processed into package food products . you 're indisputably better by your own standards , but why is it objectively ( or at least , by my standards ) immoral for me not to care about any of that , or to prioritize the benefits of meat ( in terms of taste ) over all of it ?"
9t36wk,"the united states should not allow the caravan entry into the country . as many of you may know , there is a caravan of migrants going towards the us border , with some estimates saying there are up to 7,000 of them . the migrants claim that they left their home countries in search of asylum , that 's justifiable . i have some issues with the whole situation though . one thing that will never sit right with me is how they were offered asylum and work in mexico and refused . if they are n't willing to accept asylum in a country that is better off than their own , and is willfully offering it to them , then they clearly do n't need asylum that badly . to me it seems like they have a sense of entitlement to entering the us , because they ca n't refuse asylum in one country and then insist on the us letting them in , that 's not how things should work . beggars ca n't be choosers , and that is why i think the majority of these people are simply economic migrants , which the us is under no obligation to allow entry to . another thing is that the us only grants asylum to refugees , and by the very definition of the word , these people are not refugees . a refugee is "" a person who has been forced to leave their country in order to escape war , persecution , or natural disaster , "" that alone already disqualifies them from refugee status as they must prove to us officials that they are being persecuted on the grounds of race , religion , nationality , political opinion , or particular social group , which the majority of them are not . they are not refugees simply due to economic instability . personally , i feel as though the migrants are simply trying to take advantage of the us 's immigration laws and there is not a doubt in my mind that many of them are seeking illegal entry into the us in the same manner they illegally entered mexico . i get that everyone deserves the right to better their life , but at the same time , the us ca n't accept them because it will set a bad precedent . if we let them in then more , bigger caravans will come more and more frequently , the us simply ca n't accept everyone . the us does not owe migrants anything . if they intend to enter the us though the correct channels then i would n't be posting this , but i highly doubt that is ( most ) of their intents .","maybe more will accept mexico 's offer , maybe some will try to illegally enter anyway , but that is a separate issue from them legally applying for asylum . the us is n't allowing these people into the country i suspect , with the changes in immigration policy more will get denied than before to put another way , the caravan is about the equivalent of four days worth of visa overstays , most of which come by air . this one little caravan of people , who , once they get here will use due process and claim asylum , something they ’ll surely receive , actually deserve to stay . allowing entry into the united states is how people request asylum , until they get in , they have no due process . they should be permitted entry and asylum , because , they earned it . there 's no rule stating that the caravan is required to accept asylum from the first country to offer it . a few things i think you misunderstand about the migrant caravan . applying for asylum at the us border is a legal channel to entry into the us . many have accepted asylum in mexico , and as a result the group heading towards the us is much smaller than the 7000 you estimate . they are in the grip of an epidemic of violence , and leading the world in homicide rates . it ’s a group escaping gang violence and poverty , attempting to access the us through legal challenges , who happen to have formed a caravan to protect themselves from harm along the way . they do intend to enter the us through the correct channels . to do so you have to be physically present . this is the correct channel for them to present their asylum claims . you seem to have made the assumption that none of these people have legitimate asylum claims . the fact that mexico offered them asylum might be irrelevant for some if the violence they are fleeing is able to follow them to mexico . but it 's a process , and we have trained judges who evaluate these claims on a case-by-case basis . realistically what is going to happen with this caravan is that many of the people in it will end their journey in mexico somewhere , some will continue to the us border . some will cross the border and apply for asylum ; some of those will be rejected and deported and some will have their asylum claims granted and be allowed to settle in the us . 7,000 in a caravan of which some might end up entering the us , of which a further subset might be legally allowed to stay ... that 's nothing . yes , people who do n't have a legitimate asylum claim should be turned away . i 'm just curious when the us became a "" nation of immigrants "" to "" sorry , we 're too full here . "" i 'm not arguing for every person in the world to migrate here , however , i 'm just curious as to when the shift emerged . to put another way , the caravan is about the equivalent of four days worth of visa overstays , most of which come by air . this one little caravan of people , who , once they get here will use due process and claim asylum , something they ’ll surely receive , actually deserve to stay . allowing entry into the united states is how people request asylum , until they get in , they have no due process . they should be permitted entry and asylum , because , they earned it ."
9t2r0j,"trump 's most plausible path to ending birthright citizenship would require a broad grant of something like diplomatic immunity . trump is arguing that undocumented immigrants are n't subject to our laws : if he means this as a blanket pardon , then that puts them into a similar relationship to us law as diplomats and members of sovereign tribes who have negotiated an exceptional status . this is the only path forward that is consistent with legal precedent , as far as i know . if he says the 14th amendment does n't apply to them , this amounts to renouncing any us claim to enforce our laws on that group . i know that he has , essentially in the same breath , also promised to enforce us law even if a person 's immigration status is n't exactly above-board , so i stipulate that he either has n't worked out the logical consequences in his own mind , or is n't making a serious proposal . but if we take him at his word regarding a re-negotiation of dred scott v. sandford , is n't he calling for undocumented immigrants to be exempted from subjection to us law ?","honestly , i do n’t think something like diplomatic immunity would be that big of a problem . what happens when a diplomat commits a crime in the us?the us contacts the country which the diplomat represents , removes them to said country , and ( usually ) expects some kind of repercussions to be incurred on the diplomat . in this hypothetical scenario , the us would come upon the illegal immigrant , request that their home country take them back , and remove them to said home country . i think the True hurdle for trump is getting the court to interpret the jus soli clause of the 14th amendment as applying to only the children of people who are “ lawfully admitted ” . the whole diplomatic immunity problem would almost play into his base , since illegals would no longer be subject to criminal charges , no longer have sixth amendment right to counsel , and arguably no longer have a right to the limited due process that they now have during their removal proceedings . however , you ca n't just pick a random person from another country and suddenly say "" you 're a diplomat for the country you came from "" - and you definitely ca n't retroactively declare that someone 's parents were diplomats at the time they were born . ok , what if he claims and through an order say that illegals are an invading force ."
9t27dv,"there is no good reason for banning assault rifles in the united states . if somebody wants to make the argument to ban all guns in the united states then that ’s totally fine , but only wanting to ban assault rifles makes no sense . according to the fbi , around 300 people die per year from rifles of any kind . 300 out of the total 350 million is a drop in the bucket . if you honestly think 300 deaths it ’s worth an assault weapons ban , then you should also be in support of a bicycle ban , private swimming pool ban , a ban on tall ladders , and mandatory railings on all beds . because all of those things kill more people than assault rifles .","i believe it to be generally accepted that the benefits of tall ladders outweigh any serious risk of death . however i do not see the benefits to society of assault rifles . more people die putting their trousers on than from shark attacks , does this make putting your trousers on more dangerous than swimming with a shark ? the vast majority of 1st world countries have a gun ban but do n't have a car ban not because they think more people will die by guns but because it is a common sense approach to every day life . the loss of utility for banning ladders or bicycles would far surpass the loss of utility for banning certain types of firearms . however , the gist of it was this : cows kill more people than coyotes . however , if people kept hundreds of coyotes as livestock and spent lots of time around them this number would be different . most people spend far , far more time around ladders , beds , and swimming pools than they do around firearms . firstly , there 's no good reason for not banning assault rifles . there 's an intimidation factor with automatic weapons , and i think banning the more unnecessarily powerful firearms could be a very small and very sane step in the direction of tighter control and more oversight for firearm owning in america . and yeah , i do honestly think 300 deaths is worth an assault weapons ban . to my knowledge , assault weapons do n't contribute anything to society other than as a toy for gun hobbyists . banning assault rifles does n't depend on the numbers killed , but on the inherent danger of them weighted against their use . a semiautomatic rifle that shoots a bullet with more power than a .22 lr and has a magazine capacity greater than 5 has virtually no use other than killing multiple civilians or to engage with an organized paramilitary opposition . note that we ban civilian ownership or use of nuclear weapons , despite an annual death toll of 0 . for many people , the benefits of allowing these weapons do n't outweigh the costs . further , especially for people who do n't use or have any use for an ar-15 , the cost of the ban is basically 0 , and the benefits are obvious . it seems like you 're using "" assault rifles "" ( select fire , medium cartridge rifles ) and "" assault weapons "" ( scary black guns / guns that are regulated by some particular framework ) interchangeably when the two terms have different meanings . assault rifles are ( effectively ) banned in the us as part of the regulation on full auto firearms . since "" assault weapon "" only has specific meaning within the context of particular regulatory frameworks , it can include pistols and shotguns . for example the federal assault weapons ban included pistols and shotguns . if i wanted to ban assault rifles/weapons because y kill x amount of people each year , the reason would be because y kill x amount of people each year . hypothetically , if all assault weapon were banned and destroyed no one would die from assault weapons . the argument should be based on the merits of banning or not banning assault rifles/weapons . additionally , there is the "" no good reason "" part of you argument ."
9sznr8,"legal history and politics aside , where you are born has no relevance to citizenship note : i know in the usa it 's a constitutional amendment , enacted for good reason . i also know that there 's hot political debate about whether its good or bad right now , or whether it can be changed by executive order . i 'm not talking about any of that . i 'm not even talking about the usa specifically . i 'm referring to the concept in general . \ ----- # ways to ( theoretically ) become a citizen that i understand : children of citizens : citizenship is sort of like a collection of land owners grouping together to decide how the area should be governed . like a condo board or hoa . if you have kids , you pass your portion of the country to your kids , like an inheritance . children of legal residents : if you have a green card or something similar , even if you are not a citizen , i can understand the argument that you do n't plan to go back to any other country . your children here can become citizens upon birth so they can engage with the country like any other resident . children of illegal residents : this is a little trickier , but if you 've got a family who 's been living here for many years , even illegally , i can understand why there would be a path to citizenship for their children . they have done nothing wrong , are n't going to any other country , and are n't claiming any other citizenship . application process : you apply to become a citizen , through whatever means the citizens of that country determined is appropriate , and are approved . asylum : you are fleeing an oppressive regime or other dangerous situation . you are approved , based on whatever criteria the citizens of that country deemed to be asylum-worthy , to skip the application process and join them as a resident and member instead . intelligence and counter terrorism : you have information that the country 's law enforcement or counter terrorism agency needs to protect its own citizens , i can understand if they offer you to skip the application process in exchange for that vital information . undocumented orphans with no clear country of origin : you are a child in the country who has no family and no parents . the authorities try to find out where you are from , but can not . you are n't going anywhere , do n't claim any other citizenship , and have done nothing wrong . i can understand being granted permission to join the country and receive care benefits . ( i do n't know if this actually happens anywhere , just giving an example . ) # ways to become a citizen that i do not understand : being born in a country . if your parents are n't residents , even if they are there on a tourist or temporary visa , and especially if they are there illegally , why would being born grant you citizenship ? i do n't see any connection here at all . your parents have a home country . they are still responsible for you , your healthcare , your safety , etc . you do n't lose your rights to your parents ' home country if you are born overseas , and you should n't gain fast-tracked rights to a new country either . & #x200b ;","why should a child born and raised in a foreign country be granted citizenship based on nothing more than their parents ? why should the children of a legal resident be granted citizenship , is n't that just granting it to them based on where they were born ? at the end of the day , all forms of granting citizenship are pretty arbitrary , so the only real deciding factor is what a country considers to be important . one of the central ideas of the founding of the united states is the idea that your ancestry should n't limit your options ( obviously this has n't usually been acted upon , but the idea has been there ) , and birthright citizenship is an extension of that idea . birthright citizenship is the u.s. government saying "" you do n't have to jump through any special hoops to be part of our country , you just have to be born here "" . it is a legal and political classification which denotes certain rights and responsibilities . american citizenship is desirable specifically because of the legal history and political rights it gives a person . trying to ignore the history and politics surrounding it also ignores why it is desirable in the first place . there is no greater reason to provide citizenship based on "" inheritance "" than to provide it based on actually being born in the country . all you 're doing is endorsing one entirely arbitrary means by which we can define citizenship , and rejecting another . you do see why being born in another country is relevant , even a hot topic . you could argue essentially anything not making sense after dismissing the reasons for it . so one reason to use birth in the territory as a guarantee of citizenship is that it prevents the government from playing games about who is a "" True "" citizen . the person being denied citizenship in the latter case is precisely the person being provided citizenship in the former case . it is a child , born here and living here for however many years since , and that child by definition can not have done anything wrong . yet still , if persons born within a country 's borders are not legal citizens or residents of that country , then that country has real problems . presumably we are discussing free societies , and freedom/liberty of that sort demands legal protections and rights , and those must be assigned somehow . the most logical places for these assignments are at birth , and at the age of majority , but other cultures might assign these rights at e.g. a bar or bat mitzvah . these are arbitrary , yes , but the provision of rights demands a point at which those rights are granted ( even if they are earned rather than gifted ) . i can accept that a person maybe should n't have the right to vote until passing a civics exam , etc. , but there are other rights which are properly available to children regardless of parents ' crimes , and those demand a legal status which in virtually all cases seems to be citizenship . so this really boils down to - when you are born are you a citizen of the country you were born in , or your parents citizenship . what if mom is a citizen of country a , dad is a citizen of country b , and you are born in country c. where are you from ?"
9syzi9,"punch a nazi will never get the desired result of silencing them in a modern democratic society . i have discovered that there are individuals on reddit that still believe that punching nazis is a viable tool to minimize far-right extremism , so i 'd like to see the best arguments for this . to make sure we 're speaking on the same page i 'll try to define what i mean with "" punching nazis "" in the context of this debate . i 'm not referring to an act of self-defense where the far-right individual initiated the violence either towards you or someone else . in this context the person is the physical aggressor . the individual you punch are not known to you on a personal level . the violence used does n't necessarily have to be punches , but it is of the lesser degree where the act of violence wo n't cause prolonged ailments nor be the cause of disability or death . i 'm not talking about people the far-left claims to be nazis , but where the political reality might be debatable . you are 100 % certain that the individual is a full-blown nazi . with that said here 's my reasoning : punching a nazi is completely counterproductive if the goal is to minimize the influence of far-right extremism . while in the short term it might dissuade them from using specific platforms such as the case with richard spencer , the political capital he gained from being assaulted has helped him far more with getting sympathy for his views . this is due to far-right ideologies biggest selling point is stability and order to the people they claim to represent . hitler and goebbels achieved the same by capitalizing on the brawls created by the communists ( though often provoked by the nazis ) . the communists themselves had in the 20 's berlin a very similar motto to current antifa and far-left activism : "" beat the fascists wherever you encounter them ! "" i do not believe nazism is non-violent or can be . i never expressed that i did . nor am i arguing that organized crime can be non-violent . but in both instances the best way to fight these undesirable elements of a democratic nation , is to use the legal means and rights that were given to you . i am not even arguing that nazism or kkk should be legal . i 'm only stating that using illegal violence politically will ever lead to the desired goal of protecting a democratic nation , it 's liberties and it 's rights . thanks to everyone for contributing to the discussion . i appreciate everyone who took the time to debate with me . i 'll return later if people are still active and i 'll try to the best of my ability to address each and everyone 's points . but i wo n't be active for the rest of the day .","so at least in regard to this particular person , punching him seemed to have had the intended effect . antifa hitting tons of nazis in those countries is what prevented them from becoming fascist dictatorships . never personally punched a nazi myself ( nor aspired to just for the sake of it ) , but a couple of points : the threat level of a given threat can not be accurately judged based solely on the potential for immediate violence . any ideology ( not just nazism ) which predicates itself on selectively denying certain people 's basic human rights is inherently threatening by any meaningful definition of the word , regardless of whether or not it is "" violent "" - just because you are n't throwing a punch right at this moment does n't mean that you are n't aspiring to or working towards doing exactly that . yes , violence is a different kind of offense than nonviolence , but if you think the buck only stops when an actual punch is thrown , you 're denying someone the ability to contextualize the situation and act to prevent violence before it happens . working to remove legal protections for people who you openly seek to target is a threat , and it 's a primer for future violence against those people . for example : if someone threatens me by saying , "" i am going to go out to my truck and get my gun and then come back and kill you later , "" and i have credible reason to believe that they actually will try to do this , then technically no , no violence has occurred . if your answer to any of those is "" yes "" then you are saying that i have no right to defend myself in any reasonable way until after the offense has occurred , even when i have clear and present evidence that i am in danger if i do not act and can do so at a greatly reduced risk if i do so earlier - it 's easier to stop someone from getting a gun than it is to stop them from shooting me once they have it , and it 's much less threatening to both of our lives , as i can easily subdue him without a gun , but if a gun becomes involved then one or both of us could be shot in the struggle , if not killed outright . for this reason i am not terribly sympathetic to the idea that threats should only ever be assessed in terms of their level of direct violence , devoid of any further context . in the modern world , almost any right wing person or group can or will be labeled a nazi or racist person/group . if nazi means these groups , then yes , do n't punch your political opponents . aside from that , would n't punching the so called nazi just pin yourself as a part of a worse group , of a more aggressive , more worrisome group to the public as a whole ? if a True nazi , one that espouses the beliefs of hitler like a fire brand preacher , and is actually causing anti-semitic violence , or a True kkk member , attempting to lynch a ( insert current term for african american ) or a catholic , i would be one to stop him/her from continuing their actions . fear of physical violence typically causes people to go into hiding and keep their thoughts to themselves . if those people are underground and out of sight , then they are powerless . they will keep talking among themselves , but the ideology will no longer spread . punching a nazi can be very effective in actually stopping them and forcing them to crawl back to the hole they came from , but unless they create an actual fear then it 's pretty much just an excuse for them to martyr themselves . so you either go all the way and purge the ideology with extreme violence or you let them be and try to change their minds . a big part of fascism 's strategy is centered around myth and aesthetic . a regular person with a bit of empathy is going to feel bad on some level for anyone who gets punched , because getting punched sucks . but that regular person is not ever going to start thinking that a white ethnostate is a good idea . that sort of person is not who the fascists want to recruit in the first place . the potential fascist , the target for recruitment , is actually going to be turned off of fascism if he sees people like spencer being punched . and that is why punching nazis gets the desired result . richard spencer was really popular with high-ranking people simply because common folk did n't know who he was . once "" the punching "" happened , people immediately began google searching him and realized he is an actual nazi and not merely a moderate conservative who in unfairly accused of being one . grandpa killed nazis and that brought about a modern democratic society . as an individual , in our current moment , punching a nazi probably wo n't help much . but if everybody always punched nazi 's the nazi 's would disappear fast . if you think you should be the change you want to see in the world you should always punch nazi 's . you can not hold the view that everyone one else is inferior and should be expelled/exterminated violently , and simultaneously demand that i respond to you non-violently . these views are themselves violent , and thus , punching a nazi is not an escalation to violence , it is a response to existing violence . it can be about preventing nazis from using their favorite tactics : violence . i do n't advocate punching nazis merely based on their speech , but as soon as nazi violence rears it 's ugly head ( and it often does ) - punching them back and keeping them down seems to be an appropriate tactic . if was giving the mission , "" discredit a nazi by punching them , "" my vegan humus gives me the strength to punch with the power of half a man . i would either dress up as the most pathetic individual possible ... that some how does look like a antifa member , punch them , and film the aftermath cause it makes fascist look like bullies . or i 'd dress up like a fascist , and punch the guy for not being fascist enough , starting a riot to allow police interaction stop the protest , which is a tried and True behavior of the police department . so there are several ways that you can use punching a nazi to prevent fascism , you just have to think politically . this "" punch a nazi "" thing also waters down the term for a nazi , using it to have an excuse to be violent against people you disagree with . "" richard spencer , the political capital he gained from being assaulted has helped him far more "" the only people he gained any political capital from were those already supporting his cause . the rest of us saw a guy who argues for the death of his opponents take a hit , then be a ' snowflake ' about it . we kill the later for organizing in countries outside the us , surely we can punch nazis in our own backyard . when charlottesville happened the full force of the national guard should have been out there with water cannons , tear gas and batons , but because nazis are white they were allowed to march freely with their torches . do n't think for a second if it was a bunch of middle easterners with beards that were holding those torches that the cops and other enforcement agencies would n't have cracked down on them with full force . their ideas threaten the very existence of our republic and thus they should be treated as such threats ."
9syrun,"i would be a hypocrite to vote for keith ellison as attorney general . i live in minnesota . i ’m a liberal and believe very strongly in social progressiveness and especially in undoing literally all socially conservative policies . so i am truly in a conundrum here about how i ought to vote in the attorney general race in minnesota . the republican candidate , doug wardlow , would be very happy to create laws against gays and against women which i find abhorrent . but on the other hand , you ’ve got keith ellison and the accusations against him by his ex-girlfriend as clear evidence that he is yet another man using the power of his gender against the weak , for whatever benefit he thinks is best . more importantly , since the start of the me too movement , i have made a point of saying that despicable people need to have their power stripped from them , no matter what policies they support . the government is still led by people , and those people need to be our very best . being abusive to your girlfriend is more than enough for me to write off a person as a scumbag . i was also 100 % in favor of al franken ’s fall and was from the start . i have to stand by my principles . that being said , the republican candidate would do actual damage to millions of people in my state if he actually got his way , promoting policies against gays and against reproductive rights , especially birth control which is just common sense at this point . it ’s far worse for my state if doug wardlow won . but still ... how do you vote for a guy that abuses his girlfriend ? cmv .","however , when contacted by investigators from the state 's democratic party , austin declined to be interviewed . as for the alleged recording of the incident , karen monahan refused to let the investigator see the footage , and has since claimed all of the following : that she had it , but would n't release it because it was embarrassing . monahan has also retained the legal services of andrew parker , a conservative talk show host and the former boss of keith ellison ’s republican opponent for attorney general , doug wardlow . later , a right wing "" news "" site filed a law suit to unseal record from his divorce . source they did this so that voters "" make the most informed choice possible "" . i understand the motivation to believe women who claim that they were abused , but if this was not an allegation of abuse , but some other allegation , how would you assess the following chain of events : an allegation was made against a public official by a third party . the individual involved in the allegation refused to present the supposed proof giving varied and contradictory reasons for not doing so . the person involved in the allegation then allied themselves with the lawyer of the public official 's rival . if i were a minnesota voter i 'd hold my nose and vote ellison because i believe preventing future damage trumps punishing past damage . you would be a hypocrite if you voted for ellison , if you believe him to be despicable . one who is accused of being a “ despicable person ” ( abusing gf ) . one who holds positions that you personally consider harmful to your state . but in these stances , you ’re treating a whole lot of opinions and possibilities as facts . this is common with people who have really , super strong feelings about things - but it is still objectively wrong : opinions and possibilities are not facts . the fact that someone is accused of abuse does n’t mean that they in fact committed abuse . it is entirely possible that this guy is not guilty of abusing his gf ... and , frankly , if you ’re willing to condemn a person as “ despicable ” based on a mere accusation ( that could be entirely politically motivated ) , then i think you ’re a pretty scary person . on to guy two : you think he ’d be more harmful to your state than the other guy - but if he wins , clearly many other people disagree with your opinion . i know it ’s hard , but please remember that the fact that you feel this way simply does n’t make it True . so your conundrum is created solely by your choice to elevate possibilities and opinions to the status of objective facts . if you change your stance on either , then your conundrum disappears . if you decide that an accusation does n’t mean guilt ( and there ’s no other objective evidence of guilt ) , then ellison is n’t a despicable person and you can vote for him . if you decide that maybe opinions are n’t facts , that opinions other than yours may be correct ( even if you do n’t see how ) , and that you can not predict the future ( you do n’t actually know what the consequences of voting for the other guy will be ) then you should n’t have nearly as much of a problem with voting for the republican ... you ’re simply putting your trust in your neighbors and letting the democratic process work , while standing by your own rule . the point is that moral dilema 's do n't have good choices . you seem to have a moral absolutist stance that you can not support someone accused of these kinds of issues regardless of the circumstances . in my personal opinion , this kind of dogmatic moral stance does more harm than good because it is inflexible regardless of the situation . however , if you vote based on your moral convictions on who you think is better suited for the job to better your state based on policy they will defend then it 's not hypocritical . a lot of politics only works if you vote based on policy , not moral figures . so choose which you value more , voting on moral character or voting for your policies to be represented you would in fact be a hypocrite for voting for keith ellison for the reasons you stated . however , the question then becomes where you rank your own ideological consistency and purity on this issue in relation to the other factors at play such as the wellbeing of poor and lgbt communities in your state . but politics is always going to be about dirty compromises , and as you get older , you stay more and more focused on achieving your goals instead of holding people you do n't know to an impossible moral standard that even you , yourself , will inevitably fail . for example , i would hope you 're having some second thoughts about franken , especially because of the way that went so completely wrong during the kavanaugh hearings . i would advise raising your standards , because that makes it easier ; instead of making it about their personal life , make it about their professional conduct ."
9sxs5f,"i think the "" caravan "" is worrying and we should srsly talk statistics instead of just saying that usa should welcome them . ok , i am not a us citizen and i do not agree with trump on a lot of things . he has been using "" caravan "" , which is a group of 4200 immigrants marching towards usa in hope of asylum , as a fear mongering tool . democrats / liberal media has been calling the people who is scared of the "" caravan "" racist and pretty much been criticising trump for fear mongering . i get the part about fear mongering but i feel that liberal media and democrats should think about actual statistics and logistics of taking care of that much immigrants/asylum seekers in one go . they should address the fear of those who is believing in trump now because there are definitely a lot of legitimate fears that needs to be addressed . instead of calling the people who are scared of the "" caravan "" racist , address their fears and i hope someone will explain to me why "" caravan "" is going to be harmless to the us society as a whole as well . i am sick of the news media just criticising trump when there is legit fears that they need to address and ensure ppl not to panic instead of shutting them down .","you say we should talk statistics to show it 's worrying but then are n't concerned enough to actually talk statistics . even the small sweden with a population not that much bigger than new york city had 160.000 asylum applicants in 2015 . yes , those numbers were a bit extreme and logistically challenging , but should hopefully show you that 4200 is not a big deal . habitat for humanity alone is capable of renovating 1,400 houses in a single year ."

9sup7s,"in the us , men and women are raped at a similar rate , and women make up about 1/3 of the perpetrators of rape before i start , this has nothing to do with whether we need feminism due to the truth or non truth of this idea . personally i am a feminist and to me this does not change how much we need feminism . i think it slightly changes how feminism should address the issue of sexual assault/rape but that 's getting off topic . & #x200b ; this only applies to the us , but studies from other countries , especially those similar to the us , would be appreciated as well . & #x200b ; here are the articles that lead me to this conclusion : [ -- url -- ) [ -- url -- ) & #x200b ; i would find it most valuable if people showed me more thorough contemporary research ( citing sources ) why this is wrong . short of that , if someone with statistics expertise could point out and major flaws in this research . & #x200b ; i have read through the articles , and also some of the reports on the actual surveys collected , including what questions they ask , how it 's conducted , etc . i do n't necessarily believe the numbers presented in the article are exactly correct , but i currently do n't believe any claims that women make up the vast majority of the victims of rape . additionally i do n't believe that any more than 85 % of rapes are committed by men in america . the fact that some of the sources of the articles are police reports or are self reported incidents does not necessarily change the conclusions made by the articles . i would hope that the authors have properly corrected and weighted all the information they collected . again please do n't discuss the political/social implications on this thread , if you really want to know how i feel just message me . & #x200b ; i am posting this because for the longest time i believed the narrative that women are raped much more than men in the us , and it blows my mind if this is not True . for other people i 've talked to , this does n't seem True , but the facts seem to say otherwise .","from page 24 of the cdc report that 's the source of many of the numbers in the articles you linked : even if we do count made-to-penetrate as rape , we do n't get anywhere close to 1/3 from this list . when we weight these statistics with the reported prevalence of rape and made-to-penetrate from tables 2.1 and 2.2 , we get a figure that 's much closer to 1/4 or 1/5 of rapes being perpetrated by women . the fact that males are more likely to be victims of sexual violence in prison is hardly shocking or relevant to the general discussion of sexual assault risk in day to day life . that 's a red flag to me because if the overall numbers they had gave a clean "" about the same amount "" number there would be no reason not to put that front and center . the rest of the graphs would be anecdotal sidenotes since that would be such a huge smoking gun . they do n't even give a table of each of the studies and number of victims and perpetrators of each sex . and uh ... those numbers really do n't support their point . even taking their "" made to penetrate should be rape "" argument into account ( which i agree with ) that still puts male rape victims at 6 % for rape and women at 18.3 % . male coercions at 6 % again and female at 13 % and male unwanted contact at 11.7 % and female at 27.2 % . women are 2 to 3 times more likely to be victims in every one of these cases on the only study they have long term data for . of the 5 studies they list , the ncvs and ucr shows females being victimized at twice the rate of men , the nisvs 's lifetime numbers i just covered and the other two are prison populations which , as said , is n't really the same issue ( though again , it it a very important issue that needs to be dealt with ) . conflating prison and household numbers would be like conflating soldier and domestic death numbers to compare female vs male victims of gun violence . you 're going to inflate the male numbers and you should have known that when you designed the study so i 'm immediately suspicious of why you designed it that way ."
9sudi9,"our mental health care system punishes and suppresses discussion of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in a way that is ultimately detrimental to a vulnerable person 's mental health . let me start this by saying i have chronic depression that runs in my family . i did not receive any care until i was 20 , and am now on an ssri . for depression/anxiety and vyvanse for adhd . i have had a handful of crises in my life . i once admitted myself to crisis care when i came very close to harming myself . in my experience , when mentioning any suicidal thought , there is an almost panicked response from health care providers . i have worked jobs that required me to be a mandated reporter and i do understand the mindset behind this reaction - if the threat is great enough there is valid reason to have someone committed for their own safety . however , there have been many times i 've avoided going to the hospital because of this very fear - that rather than just receiving short term crisis care or a referral i would be held against my will . there have also been many times that mentioning suicidal thoughts and feelings to doctors or therapists has been answered with a very dramatic or borderline panicked reaction . for some extra context , i have dealt with suicidal ideation since i was 12 . i attempted suicide at 19 , and the aforementioned crisis happened at 23 . i did not harm myself , but after admitting myself a crisis therapist talked down to me when i admitted i was not on any medication for depression at the time . while i am definitely an at risk individual , i am no stranger to cooing with and surviving these thoughts , and the fear of losing autonomy has pushed me away from talking openly about these thoughts in a way that is necessary to do and helpful for my mental health when seeking care . my thought is that the standards for what is considered imminent risk need to be shifted to allow people to more freely speak of this without fear of having autonomy taken . especially in a system of expensive health care like the us , inpatient care is also often a death sentence for people who ca n't afford to pay bills after this kind of expensive care . i 've known people worse off than myself who have said they would kill themselves for sure if they ended up with medical debt from a situation like that .","when you are disclosing si to someone , they need to assess how likely you are to follow through on your thoughts . that can be as simple as determining whether you have a plan and means , but knowing how much your thoughts have changed recently can also help and how these thoughts fit into a broader context can help . that means that you can be disclosing thoughts that you ’ve had for years , that you have already created strategies to address/stabilize . another person with the same thoughts may be less stable because they do n’t know how to get through them . a therapist you already know and trust will be better equipped to help you determine what you need . “ i want you to know that i ’ve struggled with suicidal thoughts for my entire adult life . the closest i ever got was ( your most intense thoughts ) . the least intense my thoughts have been since i was # years old was ( timeframe when you felt most healthy/stable ) let ’s call that 3 . i ’d really like to get out in front of these thoughts . ” our system is more interested in portraying a certain "" image "" of suicide and suicidal behaviour , partly as a result of instinctual drive ( s ) , partly due to our social history ( thank you psychiatry and religion ) and partly due to the fact that as society wo n't spend the resources to solve this problem the next best option is to put out propaganda on suicide as a preventative measure . i 'll try and address this from a physician perspective , though i 'm in internal med residency & not em . depression or suicidal ideation is a very common presenting complaint in emergency medicine ( i would estimate ~ 5-10 % of my patients on my ed month ) . between 25 % & 33 % of medical students & residents meet criteria for clinical depression ( some studies put that closer to 33-50 % ) , if e include burnout that goes up to ~ 50 % . add to that , anyone who 's worked with suicidal patients for a long time will have their story about a patient they thought as safe , ho they let go home and ho ended up killing themselves . the most important teacher in medicine is failure - the final two years of med school & residency are designed so that you fail , over and over again . , but in our case we usually knew the patient was depressed , and had suicidal thoughts , but we thought they were safe to go home . it 's there , but honestly it 's never entered my thought process on whether i feel safe letting a patient go home , and physicians in general are a very risk-averse group . a lot of it comes down to gestalt/gut impression about how the situation feels . i honestly want to find a better way to make patients feel safe to confide in us , and i know there are physicians out there that hear si and automatically write you off as crazy . i work as a behavioral health technician/care partner in an inpatient psychiatric facility , and i have for several years now , so i ’m going to be speaking from that context . and you ’re right , there are a lot of downsides to the way we currently treat suicidal ideation in healthcare . my personal stance on it is that while those downsides do exist , and while they can restrict autonomy , they should not be viewed as “ punishment ” . we tend to treat mental illness as different from physical ones , but it ’s an illness nonetheless . when you experience suicidal ideation , you ’re experience the symptoms of that illness , and when you ’re put in an inpatient facility , you ’re receiving the treatment for that illness . treatment of a medical condition will almost always come with some hindering of your autonomy . well , yeah , then you ’re gon na need to stay somewhere that will monitor you . i can tell you right now that with the shortage of beds in most mental health facilities , you are n’t likely to be admitted unless it ’s deemed absolutely necessary . but without getting too political , i would say that the solution to that is to make healthcare more affordable , not give it to less people . the attending called over another and asked my father to repeat what he said any they both laughed and this continued till there were four doctors all laughing , the attending asked , “ every intern here knows how to treat malaria , why ca n’t you . ” a er doc probably has never dealt properly with someone who is suffering from just sucidal thoughts , although they probably dealt with attempted sucide all the time which is why their so unhelpful . a therapist or a psychiatrist would be more likely to understand how to properly help you and would offer services that could fit your price range . in point of fact a psychologist would probably find your case mundane and give you much more autonomy then you thought . so i feel the issue is n’t the hospital , it ’s how people deal with doctors that ca n’t help them . to be hospitalized against your will for a suicidal ideation is generally governed by a list of criteria . obviously this is going to vary from state to state or jurisdiction to jurisdiction , and mistakes happen , but it 's pretty difficult to legally be held for longer than 72 hours or 48 hours in some cases . while i do n't disagree that it sounds like your experiences have been negative in this regard ( as a matter of fact , mine are the opposite even involved firearms ) the idea behind it is to get you stabilized for the immediate term so you can seek out outpatient or community type assistance . it 's part of a longer overarching goal of deinstitutionalizing mental health care in the united states . the fear is that someone who is suicidal or has thoughts about it and is also not medicated is currently not seeking treatment . if you do feel suicidal or have those thoughts , mentioning your treatment regimen or having a counselor or therapist you can call to make your crisis treatment experience a little smoother . that said having certain mental illness diagnosis can bar you from some careers which i feel is unfair in some circumstances because it can discourage people from seeking treatment ."
9sth7v,"the united states military operations in the middle east is breeding a generation of children who are born to hate the usa . my view is not to say that we are justified in our use of force ( land forces , drones , covert ops ) in the middle east , but that by pure situation and the length of this conflict we are breeding the seeds of hate for the usa . other countries involvement is a part of this , but on the world stage this is a us conflict and we lead the charge and have the most impact . i thought of this after realizing that next year , there will be children in the us who have been born after 9/11 , grown up , sign up , and fight and die in the middle east . they will know only this war . the opposite seems equally as True for children in the middle east who have their families blown up by a drone ( even if their parents were legit insurgents , to a child it probably does not make a difference - a us drone killed their brothers and fathers for example ) . they have been born into a war with a foreign enemy occupying and bombing their country and communities . how would you think and act , truly , if you were born into that world ? a good chance you 'd join up the "" resistance "" - thus we are feeding a cycle of insurgents with the mission to carry on this war . there is no end in sight for this conflict with a replenishing enemy force . also adding to my view are videos like the one about kids in the middle east who grow up afraid of blue skies , because drones operate in clear conditions . they feel more safe in cloudy , stormy weather . that has to mess with a young mind beyond what a first world mind can conjure and empathize with . again , this is not a statement of our justified presence in the middle east , but of the consequences of war - which has happened many times in the past i 'm sure . thanks for any input or strong arguments to change my cynical view .","were the afghanistan central government fall ( ending or at least lessening the civil war ) , would an entire country raised by taliban restrictions and education systems hate the us less than a country raised in civil war with the us backing one side ? probably could in syria for areas of the country controlled by isis . the only thing i can state is that it 's not an entire generation of children . it 's certainly creating adversaries where none existed previously because of that us involvement . you 'll find there are different views depending on country , state , city , class , religion etc . my only objection with your view might be semantic in regards to what you refer to as a "" generation "" and the "" middle east """
9steju,"vast majority of exclusive homosexuals must actually be bisexual . #introduction : when i say exclusive homosexuals , i 'm referring to people who are exclusively attracted to the same sex . from what i 've been reading about homosexuality and evolution , it does n't make any sense that exclusive homosexual people exist . the processes of evolution do n't care about same sex behaviour . it does n't select for or against it . evolution might select for greater heterosexual success by increasing overall sexual desires and homosexuality may be a biproduct of that . but evolution neither selects for nor against homosexuality . however , being unattracted to the opposite sex evolution will select very strongly against . probably the most evolutuonary unfit attribute would be an unattraction to the opposite sex . exclusive homosexuality means an unattraction to the opposite sex . so same sex attraction is very likely to exist with a genetic component . however , not having an opposite sex attraction should n't happen , at least not in any statistically significant amount . #naturally occurring exclusive homosexuality non existent in the animal kingdom : this is represented in the animal kingdom . while bisexuality is very common among animals , exclusive homosexuality has never been observed at any significant rate in the wild . the only species known to have exclusive homosexual members are domesticated sheep . however , domesticated sheep are aggressively breed for female reproductive success and also do n't choose who they mate with , so exclusive homosexuality became a trait of 10 % of rams . but in wild sheep it 's never been observed . if members of a population are able to choose their mate , exclusive homosexuality will be selected agianst . here 's an article that talks about how there are no exclusively homosexual animals in the wild but that bisexuality is rampant . it goes very into detail talking about it -- url -- what wikipedia says about it : > although homosexual behavior is very common in the animal world , it seems to be very uncommon that individual animals have a long-lasting predisposition to engage in such behavior to the exclusion of heterosexual activities . thus , a homosexual orientation , if one can speak of such thing in animals , seems to be a rarity . -- url -- #gay and lesbian teens are much more likely to become pregnant or impregnate than heterosexual teens are . > statistics show that women who identify as "" lesbian "" become pregnant at a much higher rate than "" straight "" women and "" homosexual "" men are impregnating women at a significantly greater percentage than heterosexual men > > the pregnancy rates are verified by studies in several nations , all showing that homosexual pregnancy rates are two to seven times higher than heterosexual pregnancy rates . and pro-homosexual organizations acknowledge that “ unintended pregnancy is huge in the lgbt youth world . ” -- url -- there are many ways to interpret this data . but it seems to suggest that lots of people who we consider to be exclusively homosexual might in reality be bisexual . #conclusion in no way does this have anything to do with the morality of homosexuality . what two consenting adults do with each other is nobody 's business . in fact , whether my view is correct or not should really have no effect on how we treat gays and lesbian , both on a societal and an individual basis . however , the idea that exclusive homosexuality biologically exists contradicts darwinian evolutuon . but i 'm open to how i might be interpreting things wrong , so please change my mind . i 'm looking forward to handing out some deltas .","a person 's genes are n't interested in having the person reproduce , only in having themselves reproduce . hence ( and this is obvious ) darwinian evolution does n't necessarily contradict behaviours like an individual sacrificing itself for its children or siblings , or even its parents . it 's easy to imagine how a gene might decide to sacrifice the reproductive success of individual it 's in , if that means the person has more time to help raise their neices and nephews - as long as this actually ends up producing ( on average ) more copies of the gene in question . however , it 's a bit hard to make the maths come out right - is it really worth sacrificing the opportuniity to have children ( which share 50 % of one 's dna ) for the sake of helping raise one 's neices and nephews ? specifically , the mitochondrial dna in a man is doomed , and absolutely will not be passed on to his children . for a mitochondrial dna , the time a father spends on his own children is completely wasted . so , it 's theoretically possible that a "" gay gene "" in the mitochondria that somehow made men exclusively homosexual ( and at the same time , perhaps , gave them stronger child-rearing instincts ) would be strongly selected for , and there 's no necessary contradiction with darwinian evolution . the darwinian argument only holds if homosexuality is 100 % genetic , which it is n't . those are not darwinian traits . take this analogy : "" the vast majority of quadriplegics are actually paraplegics , because there is no evolutionary advantage to being a quadriplegic , therefore evolution must have selected against it "" . furthermore , evolution does not only occur through natural selection , but also more complex mechanisms ( mate selection , founder effects , genetic drift ) . i 'm not gay , but i imagine , for someone who has homosexual feelings , this is a very confusing perhaps even frightening time . there likely are n't going to be many resources available to help them understand what they are feeling and , in that sense , a teenager feeling homosexual attractions might be more prone to experimentation with the opposite sex . i see no reason why exclusive homosexuality is fundamentally different from sterility for the sake of your argument . as a man who usually identifies as gay ( although i think homoflexible is more accurate ) i would argue many if not most people may not be completely hetero or homosexual , however straight people , especially straight men , are less likely to admit or act on any same sex desires due to societal ramifications . i 'd argue this is why predominantly heterosexual men are the least likely cohort to experiment , when compared to straight women and gay and straight men i have an alternative to the "" gay uncle "" theory : the "" just a friend "" theory . the gay guy wo n't fall in love with her , wo n't take stupid risks for more repeat performances , and wo n't be suspected even if he is seen hanging around her . the gay and lesbian teens thing does n't necessarily make your point . it 's probably just teens not fully understanding their feelings , but knowing their feelings are n't quite normal and so overcorrecting . they do n't feel like they are typically attracted to the opposite sex and so they overcorrect to acting super attracted to the opposite sex . to start , purely darwinian evolution has been supplanted by modern evolutionary theory which integrates darwinian evolution with population genetics ( forming modern synthesis ) . then embryology was added ( creating evolutionary developmental biology ) , another modern model is extended evolutionary synthesis the gay uncle hypothesis is one such model with high explanatory power . your brother ’s siblings are related to you , and them surviving is as good as 50 % of your children surviving ( because they share half your families gene pools ) . now this also works well with the observation that the more older brothers you have , the more likely you are to be gay ."

"" similarly , the republicans have for years stated that the federal debt is an emergency that requires immediate budget balancing . nevertheless , now that they are in office , they have ballooned the deficit by lowering revenue . these kinds of lies are not only repeated , but they are extremely easily disproven by looking at what policies trump and republicans actually support . such easily disprovable lies insult the intelligence of voters . trump has also claimed with no basis in evidence , such things as that the caravan of central american migrants and asylum seekers contains "" middle-easterners .

9sryqa,"an "" optimal "" system of legal immigration in modern times should not include birthright citizenship . & #x200b ; & #x200b ; to help provide context ( and to head off the idea that this view is based on xenophobia ) , i personally would advocate for much , much higher levels of immigration to the us . but , assuming there is some limit on the number of people granted citizenship ( which is what necessitates a system of immigration ) , i see two potential "" objectives "" of a system of legal immigration and granting citizenship . 1 . humanitarian - in an immigration system emphasizing humanitarian outcomes , the primary determinant of who becomes a citizen would be based on the hardship they 're facing in their country of origin and the ability of u.s. citizenship to mitigate or eliminate that hardship . i 'm not arguing that there is a perfect measure of the humanitarian impact of granting citizenship to one person vs. another , i 'm just arguing it would be the rational objective of this system . 2 . economoic - in an immigration system emphasizing better economic outcomes for the us , the primary determinant of who becomes a citizen would be their skills and ability to contribute to the economy . i 'm not arguing that there is a perfect measure of the economic impact of granting citizenship to one person vs. another , i 'm just arguing it would be the rational objective of this system . & #x200b ; i do n't see how birthright citizenship furthers humanitarian or economic objectives better than other alternatives for screening potential citizens . & #x200b ; some ways to change my view would be to convince me that : there are other rational objectives of legal immigration systems besides improving humanitarian and economic outcomes birthright citizenship is the best tool in a legal immigration system for achieving positive humanitarian or economic outcomes what wo n't change my view : arguing that , given the state of us politics , birthright citizenship is the only realistic way to achieve a particular humanitarian or economic objective arguing that we should grant citizenship to anyone who wants it , making the distinction of birthright citizenship irrelevant","that said , the obvious problem with a lack of birthright citizenship is this : it creates a permanent underclass of people who are non-citizens and may even be stateless people . there 's no country that will accept them for citizenship . if they are n't us citizens , they could face deportation to a country that wo n't accept them or imprisonment , both of which are obviously humanitarian disasters as well as economically negative . and if we somehow manage to create a system in which people born here are n't citizens but are legally allowed to be residents , you 've just invented a system that does n't solve the ( totally hypothetical ) problem of "" too much immigration "" , since the number of people would still be rising , while also explicitly creating a group of people who are subject to the laws of the country , or more strict laws than citizens of the country , while lacking the ability to vote or other protections afforded to citizens . you say one way to change your view would be to show that there are rational objectives for an immigration policy beyond humanitarian and economic objectives . you defined ‘ humanitarian ’ as alleviating the suffering of people wishing to immigrate . with only these objectives you limit the interests of americans to only economic interests as though we are soulless consumers . the immigration policy should be written to help the general welfare of americans and not be limited to their economic interests . too much immigration can hamper assimilation leading to multi-cultural communities ( by which i mean there are actually multiple cultures , not whether or not people tolerate other cultures ) . one thing to note is you seem to be conflating immigration and birth-right citizenship . these are two distinct things that should be discussed separately in my opinion but i 'll still respond to a few points in your prompt . first off , your post is from the perspective that birth right citizenship needs to be justified ... and justified only by the narrow criteria you think matters . instead , as a thought experiment lets look at why birthright citizenship was enshrined our laws . although there were earlier policies and state laws , the first federal law defining citizenship to include birthright was the civil rights act of 1866 . at that time , such automatic citizenship was ' mainly intended , in the wake of the american civil war , to protect the civil rights of persons of african descent born in or brought to the united states . ' now , i think you 'd be hard pressed to argue such protections are not still needed for migrants of any kind due to the political realities of the times . birthright citizenship is a constitutional right in this country at the moment and you gave no reasons for why it 's bad policy other then you think so . one big benefit of birthright citizenship is that it prevents the creation of a permanent underclass of non-citizens . imagine for example , we did not provide birthright citizenship to chinese immigrants in the 1800s . a permanent population without full representation or citizenship in any nation is both a humanitarian and economic concern . why not have a 3rd immigration system , one that allows people in based on how well they can integrate into your culture . let ’s grant your view for an infant born in a country with parents who are not in the country legally . now assume that the infant grows up in the country through adulthood . at that point , the person ’s home is its birth country , not the country where one or both of its parents are citizens . that person should be given all of the rights and responsibilities of citizenship . a child born in a country is culturally from that country by a relatively early age , maybe 7 or 8 , definitely by the teen years . you seem to be framing jus soli as an alternative to other methods of allowing immigration . so it is n't a matter of comparing allowing babies born here to be citizens as opposed to allowing people based on need or ability . its a question of whether people who are born and live here have the rights of citizens or not . the question is how we should treat people who will be here regardless ."

"" in the slaughter-house cases , 83 u.s. 36 ( 1873 ) — a civil rights case not dealing specifically with birthright citizenship — a majority of the supreme court mentioned in passing that "" the phrase ' subject to its jurisdiction ' was intended to exclude from its operation children of ministers , consuls , and citizens or subjects of foreign states born within the united states "" "" so do gun control laws , but they have held up rather well in courts . i 've been seeing a quote from the guy who wrote the amendment stating that it would not give citizenship to aliens , so i think it may not always have been understood this way . that there is an exception does n't prove who is or is n't covered by the exception . another way is the textualist/originalist method , where priority is given to the meaning as understood when enacted . if recent practice differs from the practice of the time , the practice of the time would be evidence of the meaning when enacted , and recent practice would not . you 'd have to make a comparison of the eo with the law to make this determination . this does seem like the strongest of your 4 arguments , but i 'm still not sure you can use it to say the eo violates the constitution , because it seems pretty clear to me that the eo is intended to start a court fight that will allow scotus to rule on the 14th amendment . it ’s True that “ subject to the jurisdiction thereof ” was meant to exclude consuls and the like — but it also excluded citizens or subjects of foreign states . 36 , 73 ( 1873 ) ( “ the phrase ‘ subject to its jurisdiction ’ was intended to exclude from its operation children of ministers , consuls , and citizens or subjects of foreign states born within the united states . ” ) and in elk v. wilkins , the court parsed jurisdictional eligibility as “ not merely subject in some respect or degree to the jurisdiction of the united states ” — e.g. , territorially — “ but completely subject to their political jurisdiction , and owing them direct and immediate allegiance . ” thus , even though elk was born within the territorial limits of the united states , he was no more “ subject to the jurisdiction ” of the u.s. at birth than the children of consuls , owing to his tribal allegiance . i do n't really have much else to add , since i do n't have much interest in defending the potential executive order ."

[ -- url -- ) & #x200b ; i came across this video today , in which brides in a certain culture are kidnapped of the streets and are physically held and forced into marriage by their family ( sometimes even just their distant extended family ) . in many cultures there are many flaws but almost all modern societies do n't condone the forced kidnap and eventual rape of women . this culture will continue to cause real tangible and direct harm to individuals unless it is somehow changed from external pressure . this tradition does n't deserve to be respected and deserves active attempts to destroy it by well meaning outsiders . i am trying to see if there is any argument behind the common view of "" we must respect all cultures "" . i do n't see how or why a culture that deprives people of fundamental human rights deserves respect , and how it is not the duty of outsiders to try to stop them . change my view","years later , after he grew and trained in swordsmanship , he came back to town and killed all the men he could possibly find that did n’t surrender and swear to change their ways , and he single handed lay saved the entire kingdom and the citizens therein from a lifetime of horrors . it ’s still messed up for those who wish to remain single . but for those who actually like the guy and were anticipating the kidnapping , this is more tradition than forced slavery . the change as to come from inside that culture to work , external pressure reinforce stubborn ppls . the thing is that bride kidnapping in kyrgyzstan is not exactly a cultural tradition , but a new phenomena . research suggests that was n't part of kyrgyz culture until the sovjet era . before bride kidnapping was unheard of , except for rare cases during war times or lovers running away together to avoid paying a dowry . since the end of the sovjet union , it was "" revived "" as a tradition even though it actually never was one . the best men will "" kidnap "" the bride before the ceremony in her wedding attire and there is also a popular sovjet movie that involves bride kidnapping . as long as a culture does n't oppress or undermine the rights of people within the culture then it 's okay to continue . but above all , some cultures are better than others but not all cultures need to be changed . cultural relativism was a philosophy developed by the anthropologist franz boas in the early 20th century to guide cultural anthropologists in studying , describing , and analyzing other cultures . it actually has nothing to say about "" respecting all cultures . "" it was pushback to earlier anthropologists ' approaches , in which non-western cultures -- and cultural practices / beliefs / norms / values -- were typically described in direct contrast to western cultural norms and ideas . not that other cultures ' practices "" should be respected , "" but that in describing and writing about a culture , those practices should be viewed from within the cultural and historical context in which they developed and exist , rather than holding them to the moral / ethical standards of another culture . in fact , most cultural anthropologists today readily acknowledge that there are practices in every culture that are maladaptive , dysfunctional , and harmful . one of the things anthropologists do is work to understand the social processes and history of those practices , because if you do n't know how and why a "" bad "" practice develops ( the context -- the part that cultural relativism is really useful for ) , it 's very difficult to actually develop a solution . today , many anthropologists are actively engaged in working with community members to develop effective and constructive solutions that can be implemented within communities to address those practices ( e.g , fgm ) . we 're free to change our condition but sometimes by force , though that 's a more antiquated expectation . not every kyrgyzstani practices the tradition - particularly outside the actual ethnicity . i do n't think you 'd be willing to adopt any traditions forced on you in weirdly the same manner as forcing anyone to do anything is bad , by your own post . i think you should learn more about it before telling a culture to change their ways especially when there is parts you are unaware of . your view is predicated on the notion that you understand this culture and the reasons for its practices more completely than the members of that culture and/or your morals are inherently superior to their entire culture 's . like , you can say "" but we were ignorant and wrong back then , now that we 've solved morality we can safely do this "" but like ... they probably thought the same thing about their previous culture so ... have we ? do you trust the most extreme members of the political party in your culture that you most disagree with to be the ones to spearhead this effort to cause cultural change ? imagine if someone from another culture saw the american practice of asking the parents of the bride permission to ask their daughter out and decided to get outraged and change it "" this culture still treats its women as their parents property ! and came chastising us for our awful practices when actually people who still engage in that practice mostly do so as a formality or polite token gesture to their future parent in laws and are going to ask the girl out anyways . and came to make an active attempt to change our capitalists traditions . like ... when we imagine these things going down , we generally imagine we 're the culture doing the attempting to change , but how would you feel if you were the culture being changed ? i think you underestimate how difficult it is to change a culture . exerting influence on another country/culture is rarely accepted by that country 's inhabitants , or by other countries . in addition , if the inhabitants of such a country may actively resist such influence on their culture . ultimately , respecting another culture promotes trade , exchange of ideas , and mixing of people . if yours really is "" the better culture "" , then eventually that other culture will start to adopt similar beliefs . part of the reason why we now believe in universal human rights is so we can make this distinction . you can believe in universal human rights and respecting culture to the extent that it does n't conflict with those rights ."

( sex is identified by biological means ) and at that point , people will have to undergo sex changes to get people to call them by their preferred sex that they want to be identified as . it 's a vicious circle that honestly can be avoided by just not caring what gender you are . it 's all a mindset . it 's all a battle of the mind . it 's all a battle of their individual mind and no one else 's . gender is a label , but it 's not a label of who you are as an individual . and that 's what people need to understand in the world today . cmv ?","so , given that gender is really important , right now , in real life , being trans seems pretty important , too . is it 10 years , 100 years , 1000 years until people start having others test their dna and grope their genitalia to figure out whether to call them "" male "" or "" female "" and where to place them in sex-segregated spaces or apply sex-preferential treatment to them ? do you feel like it 's worthless to fight for the challenges trans people face here and now because hey , things will eventually reach a conclusion you made up for this cmv and you seemingly hold up as logical and commonly accepted ? if it is self defined , then trans-individuals will be able to self define whatever they feel their gender is and those definitions will be important to themselves , correct ? if it is defined by society , then they are tapping into that societal definition by using the gender that they are putting forward . i think you are conflating your own position with the general position being opposed by "" sjws "" . ultimately , you might be right and you might find a lot of people who agree with you . the point of seeking recognition and acceptance of various forms of identity is n't to be completely reduced to those identities , but to just normalize them so that you can then move on to just being an individual , like everyone else . the problem is that not everyone is like you , and there is still a general culture that wants to call out and mislabel differences , and reduce people to something less than normal ( reduction of identity to mental illness or sexual perversion , for example ) . fun fact : the term gender ( as you are using it rather than just a grammatical term ) was coined by john money who was a specialist on intersex people to address the fact that purely biological sex language was not sufficient to allow description of the situations those intersex people encountered when choosing to live as a certain gender or being treated as one that was different from what they were assigned or their personal belief that they lack a distinct sex . sex language has explicitly failed to be sufficient to identify people because sex is not a clean binary and up to 1.5 % of the population are estimated to have some form of ( often invisible an unknown ) trait that deviates then from being defined as 100 % one sex or the other . worldwide thats 120 million people that purely sexed language can not account for which is a problem that was identified and gender language was specifically created to address . why do you think this ? if they fully abandoned the concept of gender , why would they revert to depending on sex rather than just being more laid back about the whole idea and not caring ? so the existence of trans identities being dependent on the system of gender does n't invalidate them even if they 'd go away if the system did n't exist . the majority of people determine who belongs where simply by their gender expression ."
9spd5b,"if gender is a social construct , then no interpretation of gender can be factual . a social construct is a shared assumption about reality , not an evidence-based observation . therefore , no one can be right or wrong on their opinion on gender . if someone comes to you and says "" gender is a spectrum "" , all you would have to say is "" actually , under the social construct i operate under , gender is dichotomous , "" and that would be the end of the discussion since there is no objective way to judge these interpretations as True or unTrue . what could change my mind is : assuming gender is a social construct , any fact-based evidence that supports one interpretation of gender and no others .","people saying gender is a social construct are trying to draw emphasis to the fact that we as a society can agree on new definitions that are more reflective of reality , such that we change people 's expectations about what a particular label means . i hope to change your view by suggesting that maybe you 're right that gender ca n't be entirely factual ... but this still leaves room for gender to be somewhat factual . the two terms have quite alot in common . they are both social constructs , so in a strict sense , nobody can be "" wrong "" when it comes to the "" genre "" of their book . it 's something that humans created , and given value by social consensus . social constructs do n't allow for a natural "" inherent "" answer , but that does n't mean some interpretations are n't better than others . there are an infinite number of ways to understand gender , and there will never be a final , complete understanding of gender that permits no further interpretation . nations are social constructs yet many of them control ( or are controlled by , depending who you ask ) states with armies and navies . we act as though they have ' interests ' and assume they 've always existed , but modern nations literally had to be created by nationalists because they did n't exist . frenchness and the concept of ' the french ' is nevertheless a social construct . there can still be facts associated with things that are socially constructed . the borders between nations are socially constructed , but it 's still a fact that i 'm currently in the us . money is a social construct , but i still have $ x in my bank account . only collectively does a large group of people become a "" society "" , and only such a group can create "" social constructs "" ( although the exact size is a flexible concept , it certainly does n't extend to one person ) . so , no , you ca n't just say "" under my social construct , gender is dichotomous "" . however , it is True that a dichotomous gender construct is held by the majority of people ... but the whole point of the current gender movement , such as it is , is in alignment with your view : the majority dichotomous social construct of gender is arbitrary and not factual , and therefore no one should be required to fit into that mold . also , i 'm not sure where you get the idea that social constructs are just so , and no debate about them is possible . the whole point of social constructs is that they are created and shaped by conversation and debate . saying that gender is a social construction is to say it has a history . however , how a certain culture perceives , operates and acepts gender is still a fact . and almost aways , gender is a spectrum because that 's how the culture operates . anyone who says that there ’s anything else is creating a social construct . but i believe that the gender spectrum that ’s been created is the social construct , not the biological genders themselves . the term ‘ gender ’ was popularised in the 1970s by feminist theorists to refer to those aspects of sex that are conditioned by social context rather than biology ( e.g. stereotypical personalities ) . gender is a social construct because that is literally the definition of the word in modern discourse ( it obviously also has an older grammatical definition i assume you ’re not referring to ) . you can claim gender does n’t exist , only sex , but to claim ‘ there are only two genders ’ would be to fundamentally misunderstand the definitions of the words you are using . that would by definition be an individual construct , not a social one . >> jointly constructed understandings of the world that form the basis for shared assumptions about reality . the theory centers on the notion that meanings are developed in coordination with others rather than separately within each individual the days of the week are a social construct , but if you went around saying that today was a friday , you would be incorrect . clearly some form of data exists though , xy xx chromosomes so without using the biology part purely , there is still indication because those chromosomes influence gender attitudes example , men association flowers , but flowers are n't a woman gender specific item , unless it 's like flowers on a shirt , but hawaiian shirts exist too , but it 's more likely a gender man does n't wear flowers in a certain way than a women does so something like a flower headband is more a gender woman item because male gender is never associated with that toga is good example , it 's not a dress but men wear it but its overlap is with a dress concept link from zelda wears a skirt but it 's not feminine in female gender way so rather than focusing on a specific concept of gender item and declaring it , it 's better to see it as a the collective association regarding gender and if culture clashes , than go beyond that gender concept and see universal aspects associated with all cultures instead in strict code of wear where universal concepts apply , than that gender related item can be factual but , since you 've said that no interpretations can be "" factual "" ( do you mean objective ? ) your interpretation of gender as a dichotomy can be no more True than that of a person who calls it a spectrum . taking it a step further , when you say gender is a "" spectrum , "" you 're semantically including everyone 's personal interpretation of their own gender . when you say gender is strictly dichotomous , you 're imposing that binary on other people , and depending on how you interpret the binary , that will involve False assumptions when it comes to people who challenge the binary . there 's a bit of an empistemological issue with this kind of view , which is that everything which we think of as "" factual "" is also a shared assumption . so , if you want to see people make arguments about how something is "" factual "" rather than "" shared assumption "" you 'll have to provide some more specific guidelines about how you want to distinguish fact from shared assumption . now , you ca n't categorically eliminate "" all but one "" scheme for gender , but there are certainly people with particular ideas about gender that do n't match up with falsifiable observations . there are these things called , “ social facts , ” sociologists used evidence based observations to study them . even our scientific method is designed by us and only exists because we decide to use this method to figure out truths about reality . you seem to have a hangup were social constructs are less valuable than facts , while being oblivious to the philosophical issue that no fact is truly devoid of social construction . the entire theory of evolution is socially constructed but no informed person would challenge its status as a fact . in short , social constructs are factual when they describe something that 's rooted in reality . one thing we now know for certain , our previous social construct where sex = gender and there 's only 2 genders , is factually wrong . any future interpretation of gender will have to take those facts into consideration when someone says that "" gender is a social construct , "" they are referring to social constructionism , which posits that meaning is created through social interaction across space and time . for gender , this means that what is seen as masculine or feminine changes based on the historical and political context . gender as a social construct means that people are socialized to accept that certain things are "" inherently "" gendered , such as clothing , behaviors , emotions , careers , or colors . the theory of social constructionism only defines identity as a matter of shared meaning , but it does n't define the parameters for that identity . it depends whether you believe in objective truth or relative truth . both are forms of truth , but one is dependent on context of the individual ( relative truth ) and one is n't ( objective truth ) . many social contexts , which provide relative truths to those societies , are irrelevant when looked at from an objective truth standpoint . it ’s True that there is n’t a “ factual ” definition of gender ; it is ultimately arbitrary . but as others have pointed out , arbitrary things like measurements and calendars are super useful and are real , impactful things . just like gender , these things exist and are supported because society has so constructed them . - gender is not an “ objective thing ” that exists independent of societies ; it is subjective and socially constructed . in fact , even sex is subjective to some degree : objectively , there are only bodies — the system we have is merely a useful categorization of these objective facts for utility - gender , if we are going to think of it as a thing , is also not an individual view . as a social construct , gender comes from the agreed ideas of society . now , if you do n’t like society ’s definitions , you can challenge them , but those who do support them , which is the majority of people disagree . arguing that men should wear dresses or women should have beards is actually incorrect if gender is a social construct . mostly , it means that gender , although socially constructed , is still a real thing that is important . the “ factual ” definition of gender is “ whatever society says it is . ” gender might be thought of a little like the us political system : the vast majority of people identify with one of two parties in the mainstream . we all coexist even if we disagree about what policies to take , and ideally we respect each other ’s views even if we disagree . this is why i do n’t think it ’s super productive to think about gender objectively — we can make generalizations about it or useful assumptions , but exceptions are inevitable with any system . there are lots of shared assumptions we humans make that are based on observation . we assume that it makes sense to split a spectrum of colours into categories . we even assume that our own observations are a reliable abstraction of reality , and that a reality even exists . all of these things fit in to the definition of social construct while having tangible , observable evidince forming at least some part of their basis . many are also a result of a practical need to define a broad meaning at the expense of specificity . but nevertheless these are assumptions that arise and are accepted almost universally in society . but that seems to ignore the substantial basis for subjective agreement that occurs despite some fuzziness and disagreement at boundaries of these categories . essentially , these observations and the fuzziness are a result of discretizing observations that actually fall on a continuous axis . in truth , all of these things can be relative - different things can reliably be judged to be hotter or colder , bluer or redder , more masculine or feminine . what ’s more , an infinite number or intermediate states can be defined - like warm , violet , androgynous . in this way relativity and continuity can be applied to a huge number of things , and gender is no different . if you can say michael cera is less masculine than jason momoa ( which i would say is True by most western standards of gender roles ) , it absolutely makes sense to define gender as a whole to a spectrum . the divisions between the things that are considered masculine and feminine have most certainly changed over time as well . blue for boys and pink for girls is a product of social agreement based on eleanor roosevelt ’s fashion . in this sense , the spectral and social nature of gender is demonstrable . but as a description of reality , it ’s rather inaccurate to deny the continuity that exists both in individual and social judgments like these . that relative and continuous judgments are possible on the basis of gender implies the existence of a gender spectrum in a social context . this would not be possible if a strict binary existed , or if gender did not exist in a social context . a gender spectrum is incompatible with a binary , but it ’s quite impossible to exhaustively prove that no other interpretations of the facts exist . do you think we ca n't make any factual interpretation of money ."
9sp80q,"public domain laws should be amended due to the large amounts of people currently adding to the media market so the basic premise is that ip 's and new idea are hard to come by when almost every trope/idea has a copyright behind it . we 'd live in a much brighter and creative world if we were allowed to use many public ip 's to utilize and garner support . i 'd personally push for a 10 year length of ownership of an ip before it gets opened up to the public domain . simply because after ten years , in our current media climate , everyone has either seen the product , bought it , or ignored it because it was n't to their interest . in this model you 'd have many people creating with many different ideas all throwing ideas at the wall giving everyone a chance to make it big ( though this is n't what i was going for , it 'd be nice :) ) . so to change my opinion , i 'd have to be shown the merits and need to maintain the 100 year need on keeping an ip safe . though there has been works done to try to remedy this in law/congress , its mostly stayed the same or gone longer due to corporations wanting to keep their ip 's for longer . most notable disney with all of their main cast of characters ( mickey mouse and the rest of the gang ) . a quick run down of what public domain means : the public domain consists of all the creative works to which no exclusive intellectual property rights apply . those rights may have expired , been forfeited , expressly waived , or may be inapplicable . the works of william shakespeare and beethoven , and most early silent films , are in the public domain either by virtue of their having been created before copyright existed , or by their copyright term having expired . some works are not covered by copyright , and are therefore in the public domain — among them the formulae of newtonian physics , cooking recipes , and all computer software created prior to 1974 . other works are actively dedicated by their authors to the public domain ( see waiver ) ; some examples include reference implementations of cryptographic algorithms , the image-processing software imagej , created by the national institutes of health , and the cia 's world factbook . the term public domain is not normally applied to situations where the creator of a work retains residual rights , in which case use of the work is referred to as "" under license "" or "" with permission "" . as rights vary by country and jurisdiction , a work may be subject to rights in one country and be in the public domain in another . some rights depend on registrations on a country-by-country basis , and the absence of registration in a particular country , if required , gives rise to public-domain status for a work in that country . the term public domain may also be interchangeably used with other imprecise or undefined terms such as the "" public sphere "" or "" commons "" , including concepts such as the "" commons of the mind "" , the "" intellectual commons "" , and the "" information commons "" . i welcome all and would love a discussion on what we could possibly do to change my opinion on this .","now , these method might be too harsh on the later side , or too lenient on the earlier side , but the formula can be modified , and it makes a system where people wo n't invest in keeping an ip without still profiting from it . copyright does not apply to either an idea or a trope . you just ca n't call him captain america or copy the existing captain america movies . want to write a book about an english orphan who discovers that he 's actually part of a magical world that he 's destined to save ? the answer is that part of what made the concept popular enough to be funded was that it was set in star trek . but maybe that would be solved by requiring you to register the copyright before it expires in order to get a time extension . then randoms on the internet will lets theirs lapse while anybody even hoping to make money from it would register it once they see that it 's had initial success . by the time the last book in the series hits the shelf the characters are already going to be out of copyright ( there were 10 years between publishing the first book and the final book ) . there 'd be no way to stop just anyone from making a movie series . with 10 years , anyone could make a spiderman movie ( spiderman was made in 1962 ) . there were 13 years between monster 's inc and monster 's university ... anyone could 've made a sequel at that point or anyone could 've sold monster 's merchandise , etc . the gap between the number of people making profitable oc and the number of people trying to cash in on it while making it less valuable seems to be the exact reason copyright was invented . the number of years copyright is protected always sounds insane to me in the abstract but when put into the context of mickey mouse it always makes more sense to me . mickey has n't been the most relevant media figure in tv/movies for a while now , but his theme park relevancy is absurd . ( i 'm aware there 's other ips in disney world but if you 've ever been you know it 's very much mickey 's place . if you accept that public domain is bad for ips 9 years after creation , i 'm not sure 100 years is that different . if parents suddenly have any difficulty figuring out which mickey media is officially sanctioned , and which mickey media are cheap cash ins ( and we 've seen with youtube that this can be really irresponsible in how they form malleable children 's minds ) , then they will probably stop buying mickey all together . i do n't expect too many people to play sad violin for the biggest media corporation on the planet . but i 'm part of the greater public too , and i 'd hate to see mickey become a part of the creative hellscape that is public domain media . instead of a set number , i think companies should have to pay steeper and steeper fees to stay out of public domain the longer they hold onto it . the potential problem with that is it 's short enough of a timeline that the media giants can wait the little guy out . lets say some ya book gets published under these rules that does pretty well and fox realizes it 's a potential cash cow . the big move studios can just sit back refusing to sign any movie deal with the author for 10 years and then as soon as that timeline is up , release the movie with no money owed to the author . the major corps will inherently have the staying power to starve out new creators and then profit off the public domain / because marvel/disney is actively producing the films and have been for over 10 years now , it could be legitimately confusing if another series based on the same ip started coming out now . your proposal would allow a completely different entity to start making iron man 4 . and if that company wanted to make it r-rated and full of gore i think marvel would have a pretty good reason to be upset and would legitimately lose business . i understand that your point focusses on media copyright ( not patents etc ) . my counterpoint would be that a short term copyright of ten years would not accurately reflect the realistic situation of the art profession and effectively discourage and reduce the number of professional artists . different from your average salaried profession his income may vastly vary over his career . he might have produced a somewhat popular hit within his career , but for the rest the sales might have stayed quite mediocre . now in the current situation he can hope that the continuing earnings of his one somewhat popular book will continue to support his income over the next decades and maybe bridge some difficult periods or support his retirement having a steady flow of some royalty payments . if the artist 's work would become public domain after ten years the profession would lose a lot of its appeal as valid career choice . in music the situation might be even more extreme as most people tend to have their biggest hits early in their careers . while some people would still want to make art for the art 's sake , it 's an attitude more feasible as a hobby only . in my opinion limiting intellectual property to ten years would not make the media world a brighter place , but on the contrary shrink the creative world by discouraging professional artists . if i write a book that is similar to harry potter but is different enough , that 's perfectly fine . hell , there used to be a production studio that made knock-off movies specifically so people browsing a video store would mistake their movie for whatever movie they were really looking for . it would just be 100 avengers movies made by everyone with a camera , 1000 novels featuring harry potter , etc . there 's no incentive for people to come up with their own ideas if they can just use someone else 's ideas and make money . the argument for longer copyright times is that future generations can enjoy a franchise , character , book , etc . when i was a kid and just getting into music , i loved the beatles . this was 25 years after they broke up and 15 years after john lennon died . so therefore , the copyrights should stay with the original creator for a long time . many ips have survived for decades specifically because the creator controls who can create content for it . the little mermaid , tarzan , treasure planet , sleeping beauty , snow white , and the vast majority of their catalog are n't unique but rather public domain stories that they adapted without payment to or input from the original creators of those works . when the same thing was going to happen to them they changed the rules to make sure that the "" house of mouse "" remained in control of mickey mouse . if i create a new story and write a book i ca n't sell a single book anymore . i need to sell it to publishers in a 3 - , 5 - , or 7-book pitch because the publisher will basically give away the first book in a series to sell the later books in that series . if i am on a 5 book series then the first one drops into public domain just as the series finishes and movie studios are interested . just like how disney announced tarzan the day after it fell into public domain over the objections of the former owners of the ip , they do n't need to listen to or care about my needs , wants , or concerns . it also means that they will almost never create a new ip of their own because they ca n't turn it into a new star wars or die hard without the market being flooded with perfectly legal cynical and crappy cash grabs just as the franchise should be solidifying its voice . flooding out the good stuff with ever more crap that diminishes the handful of gems is n't a solution for the viewer/reader/player . it 's the fear that all the work they 've done in creating these franchises will be taken and cynically used by others in a way that harms them . after all , once the original creator has died the original vision is also dead and the person who did the work can no longer benefit from their labor . large corporations should n't be protected at the expense of the public good , but large corporations also should be allowed to exploit individuals who create something special ."
9socp5,"banning hateful / toxic subreddits such as the_donald would only force them to relocate to more extreme , less regulated , and self-empowering mediums such as gab.com . echo chambers such as the latter only fuel the hate and rhetoric , and incite violence more-so than sites like t_donald . in light of the news headlines regarding gab.com , and the alleged terrorist ’s use of the platform , it makes me wonder if our attempts at creating a healthier web on large platforms have forced extremists into denser , more extreme , less regulated platforms . the nature of the internet means that attempts to subvert hate speech and calls to violence through mere censorship of entire groups is impossible - it is a game of wack-a-mole , with new posts , groups , or platforms being created ad nauseam . further , by completely banning such groups from the largest platforms ( which inherently have the most diverse user bases and point of views ) , no opinions are changed on either side of the spectrum . if anything , it validates the “ victimhood ” feeling of extremists , feeds into their conspiracy and “ deep-state ” ideas , and energized their base . after banning an entire community , those extreme users are then no longer exposed to the more rational , centrist or even contradictory views that are organically prevalent on the larger platform , creating a dangerous echo chamber where they feel ‘ everyone ’ agrees with them and where they are not presented with even the less radical members of their own spectrum to dull their beliefs . note : this is not calling for a complete lack of censorship for specific posts , comments , or users on the micro level - but rather banning entire subreddits on the macro level . if a post , comment , or user actually violates terms of use , ban away . change my view .","even if they do return , they likely rely on advertising dollars which could include advertising networks ( which might also blacklist them ) or individual advertisers ( which some might also blacklist them ) . if you take away many of their hosting options and many of their revenue options , its True that they may be back , but making less money per user , spending more for hosting , and with worse/slower hosting . giving a prominent platform to hateful ideas allows those who propagate them a place to congregate and to spread them . putting people who commit crimes in prison prevents them from continuing to commit criminal acts in the public . your first assumption appears to be that the extremists are n't using both platforms ."
9so8pi,"laws are pointless . no matter if laws exist , someone will always disobey them . human beings are inherently evil and value freedom over anything else , they do n't like being restrained . - it 's pointless to ban abortion , drugs or guns . people will always get them and apparently decriminalizing the former two makes people want them less . about guns , some people would get them anyway and law-abiding citizens are defenseless against them . - one argument against death penalty is that it would transform rapers and corrupt politicians into murderers , killing whatever witnesses their crimes have . harsher laws wo n't make them reconsider their crimes , it will make them worse criminals .","one reason for laws and law enforcement is to provide some recourse for people that have been wronged . now , without the law i need to take the issue into my own hands and i may be up against a dozen people i surely ca n't force these people to do anything they do n't want to do . having a law means i can use law enforcement and the legal system to retake my property because law enforcement can provide enough force to make the shady business to do what is demanded . a ) human beings are inherently evil and laws do work ( hence not pointless ) , evident by the fact that civilisation has n't crumbled into apocalyptic anarchy b ) human beings are inherently good and do good without the need for laws . humans are morally neutral ( in the sense they are capable of good and evil in equal regard ) but we need laws to mitigate the latter for the betterment of society . the fact that human civilisation has advanced to the state it has , with ever and ever more comprehensive and complex laws leading to , in the most case , more and more successful civilisations is evidence that laws are not pointless . arguing laws are pointless is the same as arguing that punishment is pointless , which is not True . laws are just rules made by a government , with punishment laid out likewise . yes , someone might disobey the law , but laws can still minimize harm , for example gun laws . yes some criminals will access guns , but the statement that "" gun laws do n't effect criminals , only law abiding citizens "" has almost no statistical backing , as reducing the gun supply overall can still minimize damages pretty heavily , as is seen across the developed world . just because a law does n't produce perfect results , does n't mean that it should n't be implemented at all . but the occasional violation of a particular law does n't nullify its usefulness . and laws typically serve not only to specify a particular act or set of acts that are "" illegal , "" but also punishment for their violation . laws give us a standardized way to approach that , something in writing that says "" these are the things that will get you restrained , and this is how it 'll happen . "" having laws in place say "" no , that 's not how this is going to work . "" laws are not just to prevent crime from ever happening , they also are to prevent repeat offenders by giving them punishments that prevent future crimes . call the police ? those guys enforce laws ... so it turns the world into an orderless hellscape . now before you even go and say "" but u/jump792 , they could just make their own rules and justice "" and all that crap , let me be clear in saying laws are rules which people follow ... so you 'd be saying they 'd make their own laws , rendering your own arguement invalid . the point of rules and laws , informal or formal , is to warn a population what actions will have negative consequences . some peasants are still going to steal the sheep but less often because they are now warned . if stealing a $ 1 - candy bar can give you a $ 1000 - fine , most people will chose to not steal the candy bar because the risk vs reward is too great . if the penalty for stealing a candy bar that you have to pay for the candy bar , more people will take the risk . rather than showing the uselessness of laws , i think it demonstrates how people can be taught to obey the rule of law . but some will follow the laws because they exist and would n’t otherwise ( e.g. they need direction ) . the fact that some people will disobey laws is n’t reason to have no laws , especially if those laws point more people in the right direction . another good example might be laws for health and safety . sure , some employees might violate health and safety laws , but more will follow it , and by having laws , it helps employees who would otherwise have little to no power have an ability to redress grievances and work in a safer environment . food safety laws improve the general level of health in society for example . the fact that laws do n't prevent every bad thing from happening does n't mean they 're pointless as long as they prevent some bad things from happening . some people will get them , but if it 's fewer bad people than would get them without gun control then it 's still not pointless . nations with strict gun control tend to have less gun violence than nations with lax gun control , so there 's empirical evidence to suggest that laws work . the only type of people you ’re referring to are the type to commit crimes regardless ."
9so6sl,"theories about jewish influence in the world is racist & wrong , but exists for a reason . let me start this post by saying i think jewish people are probably the most intellectually supererior and scrappy race in existence . no other people has been so hated in history . despite these setbacks , jews consistently rise to the upper echelons of any society they live in . the problem seems to be that on their way to the top , they have to be fairly cutthroat in order to achieve their goal ( just as anyone else would ) . this factor , coupled with them seeing israel as their “ True home ” , instead of their nation of residence , is where the racist conspiracy theories come from . not every jew is bad . however , over representation in positions of power and flagrant nepotism with a disregard for those not in “ the tribe ” makes jewish people seem bad to certain people . now , this behavior is n’t a reason to start gassing jewish people , or exhibiting any form of racism . however , historically this would have been enough to convince people of “ muh evil jewish influence ” . can anyone change my view on the origins of this stereotype ? or simply provide for information ? thanks","ghettos and pogroms are not nazi inventions , i assure you , and exiling jewish poeple from x or y kingdom was a pretty frequent occurrence . jews were not allowed to own land or participate in a number of other "" respectable "" medieval professions in some of europe , so they were pushed to less respectable professions like lending money , which many christians saw as sinful and could n't do themselves . the jewish religion encourages everyone to learn how to read so that they can pray and read the torah according to the set traditions . come the industrial revolution , it turned out that literacy and the professions jews had been pushed to were much more conducive and profitable in the new way things worked , and this wealth and status carries over to this day , but will eventually dissipate because the circumstances that favored jews in particular do n't exist anymore . in other words , modern antisemitism does use the ostensibly disproportionate wealth and influence of jews as an excuse , but it 's really a carry over from the antisemitism that was necessary to create this wealth and influence in the first place . intelligence is on a bell curve , and small differences in the averages between two groups can lead to huge differences in the extreme cases . the average jew is somewhat above average , but if you get the smartest people in a country together in one room , you will see a lot of jews . it 's easy to read a lot of jews working in a field as a product of them giving each other a leg up , but in a lot of fields they are going to be a disproportional chunk of the candidates due to requirements for intelligence and/or education . it 's True that we 're disproportionately present in specific industries pioneered by jews , like banking and film ."
9snzt3,"pedophiles should be brought into the lgbtqi + spectrum under the acronym m.a.p. to start there are three issues need to be clarified . the first is being able to act or not act on an orientation does not invalidate or validate it . if that were the case homosexual or heterosexual celibate people would have no orintiantion . any arguments related to “ but children ca n't consent ” are off the table . the second is stating that pedophilia is in the dsm-v is not an argument . the dsm is based off what society deems harmful behaviour . if you want to claim its infallibility and that questioning it is wrong then you concede homosexuality should stay on the list . the third is that this only pertains to pedophiles not abusers . this is purely related to the mental attraction . whether hardwired and unchangeable or otherwise . the lgbt community has taken on the mantle of championing and educating for anyone outside the heteronormative binary . they have supported the fetish , drag , and other non orintiantion based communities as well meaning even if pedophila is not an orientation , which it is functionally , it would still be under the umbrella . pedophiles suffer stigma , violence , dehumanization and may commit suicide . this non heteronormative sexuality is attacked and therefore should be under the protection and gain allyship of the lgbtqi + community .","i understand where you 're coming from in this view and i generally agree that pedophiles need some championing . i take issue specifically with your desire to add pedophilia to the lgbtq + group . going further , i believe adding pedophiles to this group normalizes the feelings . that 's the primary difference between being gay and being a pedophile . if we added pedophiles to this group , it would further instill the idea that "" it 's ok "" and some pedophiles will absolutely lie to themselves and slide right down the slippery slope . both struggles have very different goals : compassion and professional support for pedopiles vs. full acceptance and affirmation of all aspects including acting on ones desires where applicable , for lgbtq + . i do agree that non-practicing pedophiles should be offered compassion and support by society , and more importantly : any support that helps them to not give in to actual child molestation . however , mixing pedophilia with other sexual identities could do a lot of damage to the lgbtq + cause . however , the practical truth is that the lgbtqi + movement is inextricably tied to goals that would be inappropriate to associate with pedophilia . i think we would agree that there is something wrong with that individual and that we should not accept serial killers as a person on the lgbtqi + spectrum . maybe pedophilia is a valid “ orientation ” ( this is debatable but let ’s just say it is for now ) , but that does not obligate the lgbtqi + community to champion it or become allies of them . the community champions activities and orientations that deal with consenting adults and are n’t harmful to society . , and it would be bad for civil rights causes by tying them to pedophilies . in fact , this very proposal is often brought up by people who seek to do damage to the lgbt community and the activists within . they aim to pair this group with pedophilia to sour the efforts for civil rights in the eyes of society . but as i understand it , lgbt is about lifestyle , so its point is to defend the rights of people that do not follow the usual binary hetero normative sexuality , to live their sexuality without being judged . homosexual or heterosexual abstinent ( celibate has pretty much nothing to do with that ) people that do n't have sex for other reason than pressure from society are not abstinent because of their sexual orientation , but because of their difficulty to find a suitable partner . it 's there to allow people to live their sexuality fully . so , the comparison between pedophiles and abstinent homosexuals does n't really hold . nobody can fight for a pedophile 's right to live his sexuality fully , because it is just not possible within the very relevant rule of only implying consenting adults . urges to do something objectively unethical are not mentally healthy . it is objectively unethical to engage in sexual activities with minors , therefore it is objectively unhealthy to have urges to engage in those activities ( and sexual attraction = urges ) . urges to engage in sexual activities with consenting adults are healthy and normal . urges to engage in sexual activities with minors are not . it is impossible to be sexually attracted without having urges to act on it , because urges are part of the definition of sexual attraction . plus , as you ca n't "" accept "" pedophile couples , there are only two things you can do : treat them or punish them ( being forced into having no sexuality is a form of punishment ) . lgbt + community has a lot to loose into accepting that "" sexual orientations can be treated "" , and it 's the only positive thing you can propose to pedophiles . as such , accepting pedophiles into lgbt + community is highly dangerous for members of this community , and will give little to no advantages to pedophiles themselves ."
9sny7u,"gaining citizenship based on your parents ' citizenship should be abolished given the recent arguments about birthright citizenship in the us , i thought about whether people born to us citizens should also be automatically entitled to citizenship . 1 ) many citizens do n't understand the system that they live under . things like the system of checks and balances or the purpose of each of the three branches of government . however , every immigrant who has taken the citizenship test would be able to give an approximate answer if asked about those , because they had to learn it for the test . this knowledge is critical for the people who will be picking their representatives in congress and the white house . 2 ) because of the lack of effort that needs to be put in to attain citizenship , people also do not appreciate it very much . voter turnout usually hovers between 50-60 % of the voting age population for presidential elections , and drops to 40-50 % during midterm elections . while there are many other obstacles that also prevent people from voting , such as the inconvenience of a tuesday election , lack of absentee voting , etc , part of the problem is that for some , voting is a thing they do if they can spare the time , when it should be something they feel is their civic duty . 3 ) abolishing automatic citizenship would make citizens more equal . right now , immigrants must apply for residency , then demonstrate they deserve citizenship through tests and interviews . however , someone born to us parents who does not necessarily deserve it any more than the immigrant does n't need to do anything other than exist to gain that same citizenship . i 'd also just like to add as a note that i think this is a separate debate from birthright citizenship , where anyone born on us soil is considered a citizen . that has its own pros and cons , but it might be for another post .","one was born to citizens doing non government work in other countries , they were religious missionaries that 100 % intended to bring their children home to the us and rase them there . and if this rule was in place at the time would have probably just flown back to have the child to spare the hassle or regaining citizenship . one was born to parents that left the us with no intent of coming back and their child had no intent of being american they got their us passport to make travel easier but instead would have just not done so and lived essentially the same life . do you mean that all children born outside of us soil should remain citizenship less until they are old enough to apply for citizenship via a test by themselves ? birthright citizenship ( jus soli ) is a thing that is mostly limited to the americas . which makes sense since those used to be colonies with mostly immigrant populations . your policy focusses on children born outside of the us , but looking at the global situation it would just produce tons of passport less children that would be stuck together with their parents in whatever country they are born until they are old enough to apply for us citizenship via a us embassy to at least gain some passport . even worse once their parents visa expires , the parents would either have to leave the child alone or become illegal immigrants . at this point never having visited the us ( not possible without a passport ) and english likely not being their native language if they 're born outside the uk or australia their chances of passing those tests would be rather slim leaving them without any citizenship whatsoever . if you do n't get citizenship at birth from somewhere , you are a citizen of nowhere until you do something to qualify for citizenship . that either means that people who ca n't or do n't pass their citizenship tests for whatever reason are n't eligible for certain basic things ( e.g. passports ) or we have to create a class of people in each country who are non-citizen residents a la starship troopers . assuming we go with option b ( because kids need passports ) we run the risk of creating a permanent underclass of non-citizen residents . the citizen class can use their power as voters to introduce policy upon policy to create roadblocks to keep the children of non-citizens from reaching citizenship status , like making necessary education difficult to access . i 'll also point out that denying people citizenship but governing them runs dangerously close to "" taxation without representation "" , and that rarely goes over well . this idea would strip me of my citizenship , just because my father was active duty in the military . i was born out of country because my father served , but usually in this case i would be born on a military base meaning i still get american citizenship from birth on american grounds . in my case though i was born outside of base . i 've gone to american schools , i 've learned what it means to be american , and i consider america my home . this system would strip me of my citizenship , and force me to do something extra to regain citizenship or gain permission for residence , or go back to a country i do n't remember or speak the language of . stripping the citizenship of current americans , and future ones , just because their parents served this country is a horrible idea . although some would consider me liberal i have actually been considering if the idea of birthright by soil is outdated and too inclusive . most other developed nations have birthright by parents citizenship which reduces a lot of the immigration debate issues that we experience in the us . until the date of citizenship that child would be stateless , which is a bad situation . the us will even resist letting someone renounce his citizenship until he can prove he has been accepted in another country . the problem is that if you set barriers and requirements for citizenship , these can easily be manipulated by those in power to deny citizenship to groups they dislike for political reasons . you can see a similar sort of thing happening currently in many states with voter disenfranchisement . moreover , i do n't see how this solves the problems of voter apathy and lack of knowledge about the system . if we have that , then some citizenship testing system is n't needed . if we do n't have that , then some citizenship testing system is n't going to solve the problem ( and might arguably make it worse - if people feel they ca n't pass the tests , or do n't have the resources to learn enough to pass , why even bother trying ? ) do you think we live in a world , especially given the current climate , where this would not instantly be used to deny citizenship to minorities ( with or against the letter of the law ) ?"
9slzsn,"previous skills/work do not matter when considering a candidate for a political office . as the title states , any previous work , skills , offices held or position that could be a qualifying act does not matter when looking for a candidate to vote for . for some context , i ’m from washington state and there is a commercial that i saw on tv about a candidate named kim schrier and it stated that while her opponent , dino rossi was running for office in the previous few elections , she was helping patients as a doctor and so forth . what i ’m saying is , there ’s no point of a candidates history as long as you ’re voting for a candidate whose views align with your own . change my view !","character matters and someone 's chosen line of work is relevant evidence of character . hence so many laws help lawyers , as so many politicians are lawyers . if a candidate has held a previous office or position , you can look into how he acted while in that office . candidate a has only fulfilled 10 % of his promises in his former position , while candidate b was True to his word and has made 90 % of his promises come True . i think we can agree that in this case voting for candidate b would have a bigger change of having more of your desired policies come True than with candidate a. however i think that especially for some offices previous work experience should be considered . on the other hand the farmer might be considered as an agricultural minister over the nurse with no farming experience . in this cases the skills of the candidates would be a good indicator on whether they would be lost in the position and at risk of not fully understanding the consequences of their decisions . however i think that the second important point to consider is whether the candidate speaks a ) truly about their views or just lie to get your vote and b ) whether they have the competence to enforce their proposed plans and here is where their previous experience and skills can help you judge . candidate 2 is a nurse who is known for their contributions to local sports teams and charities . i would think most political office require a great deal of skill and experience . one needs to understand the issues facing the office , and the situation of the constituency . one needs the skills to lead a team of people and respond to constituents . before rick scott became the governor , he owned a large hospital chain . his chain purchased a ton of hospitals . during his leadership of the hospital chain , it was discovered that several of his hospitals were conspiring to steal huge sums of money from the government through various means of medicare fraud . this can tell you a lot about someone . this guy was willing to allow his company to steal a billion dollars from cancer-ridden elderly people . past business dealings reveal a lot about what someone 's motivations are or how they wield power . the public is “ hiring ” someone to do a specific job . when hiring someone to do a job , their previous skills and work absolutely do matter . contrary to the advertisement you mentioned , having previous experience as a politician is some of the best qualifying experience when running for a job as a politician . the second thing you must consider is that someone ’s skills now are heavily dependent on their history , i.e. their previous skills/work . there are a lot of lies used in media about politicians and their skills , the more information the easier it is for someone to make a better judgement about the candidate ."
9sk7r2,"trump is dealing with china is a smart but cynical way . trumps main change over previous presidents is his prioritizing economics over human rights . previous presidents do n’t have a good record of changing chinas human rights policies . can anyone point to a policy that china has changed due to pressure from america ? pushing china on human rights without ever getting any results is just grandstanding . in fact it seems like china is getting worse . the new social credit system looks scary . if you want to be cynical about it ( as trump probably is ) why should america care about the human rights in china ? in fact , america should be happy that china is cracking down more on human rights . china is shooting itself in the foot by doing this . why would america want to stop china from doing this ? human rights is one of america ’s strengths . it is an advantage america has over china . why would america want to give up this advantage ?","currently , the vast majority of the world ( by gdp at least ) plays football ( liberal , free market , usually democracy ) , while china is the only major power playing rugby ( planned economy , authoritarian state ) . now china is expanding it 's sphere of influence and it 's pushing its own vision of world politics , which would make these new markets more favorable to them . condemning china is n't just a vain attempt to get china to change , it 's a way to undermine their political and economic system to the rest of the world , particularly those that are facing more and more chinese influence . again , this is to ensure that the rest of the world keeps playing by america 's rules . related , the us would prefer more liberal democracies in the world that have the same values and are more natural economic and military allies than those of pure straregic value and convenience . i would argue the opposite . he 's going against china for all of the right reasons but doing a very poor job of actually picking policy choices to solve these problems . with a country like china that aggressively pursues global influence , the only way to beat them is to demonstrate a strong parallel global network that does n't include them . you said trump is dealing with china in a smart way , but you did n't really say what trump is doing about china and why it 's smart ? previous administrations did the opposite : opening up and sustaining ' free trade ' with china ( their human rights abuses notwithstanding ) for the benefit of investors and to the detriment of the working class . it seems unlikely that china will change its economic policies based on pressure from the united states either . china is ( somewhat ) centrally planned and per the human rights thing , clearly does n't really care about breaking a few eggs to make an omelette . on top of that , trump 's tendency to ignore human rights violations has n't gone unnoticed by our allies . i would argue that the True cynical/smart move would be to consolidate with our allies , even if it means making some meaningless , but well intentioned , statements supporting human rights . by skipping the pleasantries , it seems like trump is insulting our allies and giving up the moral high ground for very little benefit , at best , and a losing gamble , at worst . we have farmers who are growing crop that they have no one to sell to as a result of his trade war . so we 're taking some of the money that we borrow from china ( and pay interest on ) to give away to farmers in the form of subsidies in exchange for them not being useful ."
9sjmbr,"there has never been a time in history nationalism created a successful and sustainable society . with the recent rise of nationalism and the president of the united states declaring he is a nationalist ; it seems people are attaching themselves to ideology that historically led to unsustainable conditions . maybe i am under-educated , but as an economic historian it appears most nationalist movements are flashes in the pan and the vast majority of civilizations with the greatest general welfare were multicultural and members of a greater network of supranational institutions . are there examples in history where nationalists or race and cultural oriented nationalism created a society that could be seen as a benchmark ? when thinking of the greatest civilizations in human history many of them stretched across vast areas of jurisdiction including many cultures and colors of people . often they require individuals to put the needs of society before their own personal identities ; however i can not identify one case where nationalism led to a sustainable solution for long term growth and sustainability .","but since you want the name of one monoethnic state creating a successful and sustainable ... japan . most great civilizations of the past relied on vast amounts of slavery , serfdom , or other similar forms of forced labor , correct ? turkish nationalism , as conceived of and sustained by ataturk , created out of the wreckage of an autocratic empire a sustainable , secular constitutional republic that remains today ( even as it shifts further to islamic fundamentalism in the 21st century ) . of course , atrocities associated with this nationalism ca n't be overlooked , but the society it created has ultimately benefited an increasingly unstable and theocratic area of the world . since i cant access the race mixing post i 'm doing it against both sides regardless of what they think and will stick with the free state of jones ancesestor things that seem to be helping me out . one of the largest aspects of colonial life , was that civilized members of society felt like beasts . men felt no attachment to the land , because they felt they had no identity because the colonies were such a gruff place to live . this lead to most male colonists ( women were in much smaller quantities ) having an identity crisis , and no personal investment to the colonies . it was literally that same attachment to the land , and wanton entitlement that lead to americans being so dissatisfied that they needed to incite a revolution . but ancilary parts of nationalism , your culture , where your from , the things you cherish about what your country does for you , those can all be placed under the bucket of nationalism , and those ancilary elements are pragmatically a reason some people have to be nationalist ."
9sjfku,"nothing is wrong with abortion before the third trimester , if even . life does not begin at conception . religion does not govern women ’s bodies nor should it govern anything in politics . if a woman wants to use abortion as birth control , she should absolutely be allowed to even if it may damage her body . the argument that babies should be given up for adoption is extremely flawed , as there are far too many kids up for adoption already that will never be taken in and a woman should not have to suffer nine months of pregnancy just to have to give their baby away when they could have simply aborted it for a lower financial and mental cost .","just because some of the loudest voices in this argument put forward religious arguments does not make their position ( pro-life ) inherently religious . we live in a democracy ( at least i do ; a representative republic is a form of democracy ) , and that means that we are allowed to vote based on our preferences and beliefs . if i were a religious person , you can bet your ass i ’d vote based on whatever religious code i was brought up to revere . that ’s inherently just as valid in a system like ours as any opinion reached via secular means . religious people ’s opinions are just as valid as mine and yours , and it strikes me as pretty damn anti-democratic to suggest that the opinion of hundreds of millions of religious people can not be used to shape policy . there is a giant demand for babies to be put up for adoption . the problem is , most kids enter the foster system around the age of 7 . most parents want to adopt a baby not a kid . if we were to foster a culture that the most loving thing a person can do for their newborn they ca n't raise is give it up for adoption , we would solve lots of society 's problems . however women shouldnt have the right to abort if the man doesnt also get a say or a chance to walk away . he shoots both mother and child . he next walks into a delivery room , shoots the woman giving birth , the child who is being born and the doctor , a pregnant woman due in two days ."
9sj85t,"asking people to condemn white-supremacy is a cheap power move i was reading this thread when it struck me : [ -- url -- ) in an edit the op asks : "" / u/spez can you at least comment to say you do n't support fascism and neo-nazism ? because the actions of reddit say otherwise . "" there are many layers of nuance to be had here , i 'll be the first to point out . when trump was asked the first time to condemn white supremacy it felt like a legitimate question to ask . i think that at that point some people realized that they could use it as a tool to show dominance over those with supposed "" power . "" if you do what they ask then you are legitimizing their dominance over you . the socialists would argue that this is n't the case because they do n't believe in a power hierarchy . i think that is not True . if you refuse then you are labeled a nazi-sympathizer , which is identical to being a nazi yourself . perhaps someone has a different perspective on this , but it seems very much like an angry mob making demands ( explicitly they are asking and not demanding , but i would argue that the implication is clear ) , and i 'm pretty sure that there is literally no scenario ( at least in principal ) when anyone should do something because an angry mob demands it . i think that the assumption about people you are n't sure about should be that they do not support fascism . asking someone to assert it just does n't sit right with me . reportedly trump said after condemning fascism the first time that it was the biggest mistake of his life . maybe he was right . & #x200b ; [ -- url -- ) the students tell the dean that he has to put his hands behind his back , and when he does they laugh at him . i think this is basically what is happening here . there a tinge of sadism to it .","that population basically asks for this person who is supposed to serve them to give them to bare minimum acknowledgement that yes , they are listening to , hearing and attempting to serve them . reddit is a private company , but regular customers of a private company also like to feel like their voice is being heard and that their views are valuable to the company . thus asking spez to acknowledge the basic and bare minimum , granting that this group of customers has enough value to be recognized . certainly if its done in a manipulative and mob manner then it can have a power aspect to it . however , saying that such an inquiry is necessarily a power move is quite narrow-minded . such logic would infer that any question posed in such a leading way is necessarily a power move . because your post history suggests otherwise ( obviously do n't actually mean this , just for the sake of parallelism ) - such a question odes attempts to pigeon the recipient into giving an answer on something , but it is not a cheap power to move to inquire into someone 's endorsement of something that is traditionally morally abhorred , especially when there may be legitimate reason to question the recipient 's position on the relevant issue . maybe its fair to assume that most people are opposed to fascism , but in the case of trump some believe there is legitimate reason to question this assumption . in fact , i would argue that in this case they only way it could even partly be considered a power move is if the individual actually does not condemn the relevant topic , but feels compelled to say that they do because of the prevailing social opinion on the topic prevents them from expressing their True opinion without consequence . you ’re saying condemning something that should be condemned is bad because then you are allowing someone to have ‘ dominance ’ over you . the thing about this situation is that facts suggest that the parties in question do , in fact , support fascism . in the case of trump , it 's suggested by things like trump retweeting white nationalists , the fact that a large amount of his support base are demonstrably white nationalists and neo-nazis , that he was literally endorsed by one of the most prominent white nationalists during his campaign and waffled on disavowing said endorsement ... like , trump 's links to fascism are pretty much not in dispute here . calling on him to condemn fascism was giving him the benefit of the doubt at that point , frankly , as it would be today . the reddit admin thing is less clear , but the fact that the main hotbed of the aforementioned donald trump white nationalist support base is on reddit , appears to be regularly in breach of reddit 's own policies against hate speech and calls for violence , and has been nonetheless allowed to remain on the site ... well , that suggests that reddit admins tacitly support these views , and so it seems reasonable to ask for , at the very least , some sort of official distancing . that they wo n't do it does n't personally suggest that they are fascists , to me , it suggests that they care more about not aggravating a huge and lucrative portion of their userbase than they do about taking a stand against white nationalism and hate speech , which is , frankly , almost worse . in the case of trump - it is legitimate dominance because , as the president , he answers to the american public . however i think things are different when countries fight wars over things . winners of wars effectively denigrate their opponents ideas through bloody violence and so invalidate them to produce a world where those ideas are no longer acceptable . if the nazis won , they ’d get to live in a world where nazi ideas where the norm and acceptable , but they lost . as such , the world can no longer contain those ideas and people who still hold them are effectively bitter clingers and on the side of the enemy . but the civil war is pretty far removed compared to ww2 and there would have been similar bitter clingers after that loss too . ideas that precipitate and lose wars get treated differently than other ideas . losing that war is the ultimate loss of face for that idea and casts it into a world where it is no longer tolerated because that is what it means to lose a war ."
9sikys,"all drugs should be legal in the us in the united states , we are facing a terrible opiod and benzo crisis . we lock up the victims while the cartels are still going strong and reeking havoc in central and south america . the reason most people are dying from these drugs is due to the cutting of drugs , improper dosage , or completely fake drugs . obviously there are people dying from long-term use or committing suicide , but with the user knowing exactly what and how much of a given substance they are putting in there body , the od rate across the board would decrease significantly . law enforcement can also use drug usage as a scape-goat to invade the privacy of impoverished or minority families . a very large majority of the cases of police brutality is connected to suspicion of drug usage or possession . the increase in violence in central and south america is connected to the production of heroin , cocaine , marijuana , and others . we have families fleeing their home countries due to the violence of cartels and terrorist groups . now seeking asylum in the united states . the violence in the countries would greatly be diminished if there biggest market for profit was gone . the medicinal properties of marijuana , psychedelics , and mdma are listed as schedule i by the fda . with legalization of these substances , we would have far better treatment for people suffering from ptsd , despression , anxiety , and other mental health problems . another problem with prohibition is the gateway drug theory . a very large percentage of drug addicts start with weed . lets say jim wants to buy some weed and finds a guy at his local high school . jim is now connected to the illegal drug trade and can also get coke , heroin , xanax , meth , etc . jim gets caught smoking weed and and is getting drug tested , so he moves to a harder drug that ca n't be tested by a general drug test . now jim is addicted to k2 or something along those lines . he does n't stop there and starts doing other drugs that his k2 dealer has . at 25 , jim is addicted to heroin and dies of an overdose of fent . & #x200b ; my last point is people will always get what they want . if someone wants to get heroin , they will get heroin . why cause all these problems so we can try to stop people from doing what they want to do ? how many people would start doing heroin just because it was legal ? if we had proper education and reformed our drug policy , our society would have more trust in the government . my question is how would you go about solving these problems ? i 'm very eager for this discussion and want to know other peoples solutions to solving these problems . & #x200b ; & #x200b ;","some drugs should not be legalized , which means regulated , taxed , and otherwise controlled by higher authorities ( usually the state ) , and instead should be simply decriminalized , which means there are not legal or criminal penalties for possessing or using it ( without committing crimes at the same time , like driving while under the influence ) , but otherwise there is not regulation of its production , sale , or use . what we are seeing in states with legalized marijuana is favoritism towards large companies - often pharmaceutical companies - that has out-competed existing growers . many of these existing growers have years of expertise , knowledge , and experience about different strains of marijuana , their breeding , and usage , that is being lost by the industrialization of marijuana , especially for medical use . legalization is already leading to marijuana 's use becoming "" trendy "" as companies appropriate the knowledge and techniques to "" goopify "" cannabis , especially with cbd products . these profits are not going to people whose family members were locked up for simply using the products in the past ; they are going to big corporations and privileged people who would have been against marijuana in the past , but now use it to turn a profit and drive out small producers and sellers . at dispensaries , because of all the paperwork and control , it is easier for mass producers of extracts ( with a high markup ) to sell their less diverse products rather than small scale producers , who will use more homegrown strains and varieties of applications . some should only be decriminalized to reduce the control that mass production industries and government regulation will have on them and to allow more people access to more varieties with less economic inequality . sure i could maybe find some eventually , but it would n’t be easy and i ’d probably give up and move on before then . hell , i ’d wager that plenty of people probably do n’t even know where to find weed , let alone heroin or meth or whatever else . \ - i would say that it comes from the belief that the growing mind is especially sensitive and important to society , and that there are certain things that children are incapable of understanding or acting rationally with regard to their consequence , and so society ought to act to restrict them in some ways for their own benefit and for the benefit of society . yet we also know that adult humans are also quite prone to impulse , indulgence , and not fully comprehending the negative consequences of something if they wo n't be felt until down the road , are there then some decisions that , just like children , we are incapable of understanding or acting at all rationally in regard to their consequences ? yet , 15.5 % of the us adult population still smokes , and this number becomes significantly higher when looking at the less educated and lower incomes sections of the distribution . take a drug such as heroin which is much more addictive , many times more unforgiving , and literally scientifically shown to deteriorate the brain itself ( even when it has n't been maliciously cut or mixed ) . given the capacity of people for impulsive behavior , indulgence , and irrational short-term behavior , are inability to effectively educate people otherwise , the obligation a state has to maintain the strength of its populace , and the highly unforgiving nature of a drug such as heroin , why should the government not act in the best interest of its citizens and restrict its use ? i agree that there is some truth to the gateway drug theory , and i have personally known people who have gone down similar paths . i might debate the extent of the truth it holds , but either way this is more in support of an argument for legalizing marijuana than legalizing all drugs , as if you really believe that there would be less use of drug such as heroin when there are no longer legal consequences , it is easily accessible , and there are companies who stand to profit from growth in its use then i might really question your rational . i am absolutely in support of efforts to combat this such as free clean needles , or even free provision of a method for testing the potency ( this may not be possible without a lab ) . i agree that the crimes of south american cartels are a tragedy and that we ought to do what we can to eliminate them , but as is the case with nearly any nation-state the government 's first and only obligation is to its own citizens and there well-beings . if it is better for the us for some drugs to remain legal then the government has no reason to legalize them because of concerns around the well-being of other nations , now it is still obviously the morally necessary thing to assist these countries as you can , but not by compromising your own law . i agree , any drug that has medicinal benefits should absolutely be allowed to be used medicinally as much as possible , though it must be done it such a controlled way that there is little risk of criminal use . law enforcement should never abuse the rights of any of its constituents , but that is a problem of its own . people do not always get what they want , though there is fair question as to whether the sacrifices of privacy , cost , etc. often necessary to fully restrict something - lets say drugs - are worth the ends of restricting it . singapore for instance has legitimately no illicit drug use , but they also have very strict security and issue the death penalty to anyone caught with drugs - clearly not worth it in my opinion . legalize the safer drugs , lsd , weed etc , and leave the ones that are basally poison illegal . the big issue that you may not be seeing here is that these drugs even if legal will have to be prescribed by a doctor . the whole do no harm thing will make most doctors be weary of prescribing the drugs even though it is indeed legal , since patient deaths and health effects is tied to the doctor 's license to practice medicine . one can make the argument that for some drugs , in time , as more research is done , and doctors have fine tuned how to use it appropriately , they will be just fine . however , you did say all drugs , and not every drug has a place in medicine even after research . those drugs will basically never be prescribed and now , we are back to the drugs basically only being able to be obtained by illegal means . i do agree with the problems you have said about drugs and the war on drugs . the act of legalizing any drug means it has the government backing that these drugs do not have an overall bad effect on society so it is on the legal side , like alcohol and current trend of weed . so in terms of how we solve these problems without ' just legalize everything ' , how about the fda gets more funding and a reform in research on drugs in general ? have laws on research be more available , so that any company that wants to get in on the drug , or even the social movement can fund research in a legal manor that when the time comes , it will be actually looked at before deciding if a drug should be legalized or not . however , it is the most feasible , and i rather live with certain drugs going in and out of fashion much like the latest diet trend as opposed to blanket ban or acceptance . the problem with this is that different drugs have different health & social impacts , that ca n't ( or should n't ) be handwaved by saying "" all drugs "" . some illegal substances are less harmful than tobacco , alcohol , or even the over-perscription of anti-depressants . i think you ’re right , rates of drug abuse are very low in norway . i think - although of course it ’s hard to prove one way or another - that it may be due to other factors . specifically : drug abuse rates are related to poverty and hopelessness and norway is extremely wealthy , has possibly the best education system in the world and relatively good prospects for social mobility . but the problem is that legalization makes it much more likely a person who would have never have seeked out heroin will be around it/try it . i ’d argue that we ’d inevitably have a greater % of people heroin addicted if legalized . a tiny amount in a drink would be enough to kill someone and "" ope , another overdose ! "" op , making all drugs legal would be horrible ( forgive me for not explaining why , i ’m just tired ) , i believe a smarter approach would to be to decriminalize them . for example , one respondent can believe that all drugs should be legal ( on libertarian grounds ) and also believe that organized crime in south america is within the us ' purview and be entirely consistent within his own logic . a second respondent can believe that legalizing cocaine would be a disaster for south american countries since legalizing possession of coke would increase usage and thus illegal production and thus cartels . remember that black markets need only be cheaper than legal options to exist ( hence the persistence of bootlegging after the 21 amendment ) . jim smoking weed is high school then overdosing on fentanyl as a result of his desire to avoid positive drug tests at work rhetorical questions surrounding the nature of free will , black markets , and people 's relationship with their government a grain of sand sized dose of some synthetic opioids can be enough to cause a deadly overdose . these substances are so deadly and concentrated that there is no safe way to use them outside of a clinical setting with a trained anethesiologist . a spill from those narcotics on public transportation or on public places could pose a serious hazard to the public . whatever you think about the drug war , this category of drug is so dangerous that it invalidates the idea that we can safely legalize all drugs . if you jail people on a drug usage charge , that 's not going to make the psychological connections needed to break a long-term addiction . if everyone caught doing drugs was sent to rehab , we would have no reason for police to invade homes and privacy unless someone is suspected of many of the drugs currently outlawed have no medicinal value , adverse negative effects on the health of the individual after pro-longed use , are counter intuitive to the goal of a more productive society and overall can create public nuisances as in requiring more attention from law enforcement , ems and medical personnel as a result of behavior or problems caused by those abusing said substances . furthermore , more readily accessible drugs for the general population also means the youth ( as in kids ) of the country will have more exposure . prescription drugs and marijuana use have already been a problem in schools for years . you really think that access to drugs like heroin to a 14 year old more readily that it already is in some places would be a good thing . we ’re talking about exposing the future generations of our country to highly addictive substances that will take away from their education , overall health and productiveness in society at a early age . i can agree that the csa chart needs to be revisited pertaining to certain drugs , specifically marijuana . things like heroin , meth , pcp etc. have no place being legal . you may argue that ending prohibition on said drugs would cause crime to fall , i disagree . there will be a new market for cheaper and untaxed drugs not controlled by corporations or the government . cartels will still be in business and you ’ll have even more people manufacturing and selling drugs on the black market . for example , drugs like cannabis can become legal the same way alcohol and tobacco are . cannabis is relatively less dangerous and harmful to the user and to society , and the effect on society it has from being legal wont be as bad as the effect of having it illegal ( drug cartel violence , children and teens have easy access ) . the use and possession of drugs like meth , coke , and heroin should be decriminalized . users and addicts should not be treated like criminals , and those with addiction problems should be able to get help in order to overcome their illnesses . this can include centers where addicts are given small doses off a pure version of the drug they are addicted to , like in portugal . when portugal decriminalized the use of all drugs , and opened up their addiction clinics , their addiction rates dropped . those who use drugs and are not addicted , and can do so in their own privacy without hurting anyone else , should not be bothered with . we generally do not want to encourage the use of drugs like meth , coke , and heroin because of their capacity to destroy the individual and cause damage to society . yes , it is True that more people die from alcohol every year ( 88,000 ) than all illegal drugs combined ( 18,000 ) , but i would guess that the number of people that would die from these illicit drugs would go up if they were marketed and pushed the same way drugs that we have currently legal like tobacco and alcohol are . maybe i am wrong , but i ’m just trying to imagine being able to buy high grade cocaine ( which is very easy to overdose on ) at a convenience store or gas station like you would a pack of cigs or some beer . still those who fall victim to addiction to these substances should not be seen as criminals , because addiction is a medical problem , not a criminal one . to treat a medical problem as a criminal problem is immoral . drugs with potential medical benefits that are worth studying should also be decriminalized , like lsd , peyote , and psilocybin mishrooms . when you say legal , do you mean that all

less of an issue . people who would consider experimenting if there was no penalty would turn into fullblown addicts ."
9sgvut,"the 2-party system in the us is fine because it automates the coalition process and promotes moderation many have lamented the 2-party system as an anachronistic relic of early , primitive democracy . however , i ’d contend the 2-party system is net-beneficial . the first benefit is that it automates and legitimates the coalition process . in parliamentary democracies , coalitions ( if necessary ) happen after the votes have been tallied . they happen behind the scenes without explicit voter input . this can cause issues with voters unwittingly voting against their own interests . for example , consider an ideological scale where +1 represents slightly conservative centrists and where +10 represents conservative extremists . in this example there are 3 conservative parties with ideological scores of +2 , +5 , and +10 . a voter with a score of +4 would be attracted to the center-right party ( score of +5 ) since there ’s an ideological distance of only 1 . but then , circumstances could tempt the +5 party to join the +10 party to form a coalition with a mean ideological score of +7 . this means the +4 voter has essentially been tricked into voting for a +7 coalition which has an ideological distance of 3 . this voter would have picked the +2 party ( ideological distance of 2 ) if he knew what the +5 party would do , but the die is cast at this point and the next election is many years away . moving beyond theoretical explanations , there are examples in the real world . libertarians of the rand/ron paul variety might have large differences with traditional conservatives , but the only way they could ever get any of their initiatives codified into law is by working with conservatives . thus , the republican party serves as an informal coalition between these two interests . voters in a 2-party system are secure in knowing what type of government they ’re voting for because the coalition has been sorted ahead of time . a center-right voter ’s stomach may churn knowing some ultraconservatives might be among his coalition , but at least his party wo n’t make a deal with the devil and form a coalition with the center left . these “ across-the-aisle ” coalitions are not uncommon in parliamentary democracies . multiparty democracies give the illusion of choice , but compromise is usually necessary to govern . special-interest/fringe parties rarely win outright . instead , they hope to force a coalition to get their laws passed . this is fine if you ’re a single-issue voter voting for a special-interest party , but if you have a broad ideology then all a multiparty system does is essentially kick the issue of forming a coalition from the voters to the politicians after the election . ---------------------------- the second benefit of the 2-party system is that it promotes moderation , or , at the very least , it blunts extremism . this might sound crazy with the recent election of donald trump but bear with me . extremists have less power in 2-party systems because they are easier to ignore . the only time they get much attention is during the primary , where every other voter of their party is also a factor . to use the numerical examples again , republicans must factor in every voter from the +1 to the +10 . after the primary , both parties race to capture the “ median voter ” which would be a 0 on the ideological scale . hence , each candidate moderates as much as they can without completely alienating their party . this has the result of reliably producing governments that range from +3 to +5 ( center right ) , or -3 to -5 ( center left ) . the reason these tilt towards moderation is because the extremes have far less bargaining power than the moderates . who else are they going to vote for ? a +10 voter flipping to the democrats is unthinkable . extremists can threaten to not vote or to vote for an irrelevant third party ( essentially wasting their vote ) , but political science studies have revealed this tends to be rare . the phenomenon of “ voting for the lesser of two evils ” means extremists might grumble , but they tend to fall in line . for a real-world example , look no further than immigration policy . cracking down on immigration has been plank of far-right parties for decades , but little has been done since it ’s not popular with moderate voters . the us faces millions of illegal immigrants and a real prospect of whites losing majority status , and yet there ’s still been barely any action taken on the issue . there have been some ineffective executive orders and some lip service , but little else . trump did not spend his congressional political capital on immigration despite it being his signature campaign promise . instead , he worked on tax cuts for the wealthy and scotus nominees , policies that were much more in-tune with the center-right and the lean-right . compare this to europe where multiparty parliamentary democracy is in place . a few million muslims illegally immigrated , and there was political chaos . the entire eu nearly imploded to populism , center left + center right parties have been devastated , democracy is nearing collapse in countries like hungary and poland , and leaders like merkel scrambled to move to more extreme policies to shore up their flanks . merkel has to worry about the afd . trump does n’t .","the 2 party majorities force coalition building within their tents , but it stifles ideas with the loudest members of the party . this leads to minority rule , which is kinda contrary to moderation . the moderate people are lost within the loudest of special interests , nra , coal companies , big business , big pharma , etc. . another undemocratic way to grab power and hold it within the minority party lies in choosing your voters . voter id laws , closing polling places in carefully selected districts , gerrymandering , purging voter rolls , and not accepting ballots from felons who have paid their debt to society in full or even people who forgot to sign their envelope or did n’t use an identical signature are all disenfranchisement tools first dreamt up in jim crow era politics . i ’d say our system needs a lot more help than just expanding our party system to make it more representative of the public . we also need to fix the corruption and erosion of democracy by rich plutocrats that fund the system ’s breakdown . you assume that all parties can neatly be placed on a line of two polar extremes ; the entire point of multi-party systems is that that is not the case merkel has to be concerned by populists running to the right of her center-right platform . trump does n't . point two : he ( trump ) has still taken action on immigration . an additional 5200 military personnel are being deployed to the border as reported in the last hour . all of which is to say , comparing trump 's ineffectual tenure to merkel 's coalition imploding while far right parties succeed in europe is n't a comparable contrast . this is confusing , are you alleging that the illegal immigrants have something to do with white-americans losing majority status i.e. illegal voting ? are you suggesting that while they maintain a marginal majority the lack of action is proof that winner take all systems are more effectual than coalition governments ? during the last presidential election , bernie sanders was the left , hillary clinton was the center , and president trump the right . trumps election has shifted the political dialog to the right ... in no way does a two party system promote moderation . about 90 % of districts are not competitive between the two us parties , meaning that in most cases the primary functionally is the election . when that happens , candidates are pushed away from the center because they need to appeal to the majority of primary voters of their party , who of course will be further from the center than the majority of voters of both parties . california state elections provide a good example of this , especially with the recent change to allow two candidates from the same party onto the election ballot . results from the last few years suggest the change has resulted in more moderate politicians being elected . i want to adress this point in particular because it seems to stem from someone who is rooted in a two party system and is n't culturally familiar with multi-party systems . a centre right voters stomach in a multiparty democracy does n't usually perceive a coalition with the centre-left party as a deal with the devil because both these parties are centrist and do n't contain ideologically more extreme people . while a two party coalition in a two party system necessarily includes the fringe edges of both parties . for a centre right voter a coalition with a centre left party should end up way closer to his wishes than an implicit coalition with a far right block . let 's entertain your political spectrum : centre left : -3 ; centre right : 3 far right party : 7 ; far left party -7 . your centre right voter might be a 2 , for him ja coalition with the centre left should work way better than one with the far right . granted he does n't know what his favourite party will do , but the party itself knows that certain coalitions harm its probability of a good election result in the next election . so , under your framework , in which having only two parties forces each party to be moderate , how do you explain the republican party ? you 're saying that our two-party system should encourage moderation , but the republican party is literally the only major political organization on the planet that denies climate change . it 's the only major political party in a developed nation that denies healthcare as a right . it is the only major political party in a developed nation that believes in unrestricted access to firearms . note that not only are these positions extreme outliers in a global sense , but they 're also outliers compared to the american public , in which only 14 % of people believe climate change is not real ( honestly , that 's still distressingly high , but , moving on ... ) , 70 % of americans support medicare for all , and 90 % of americans think there should be background checks for all firearm purchases . oh , and how could i forget republican tax policy , which is all about cutting taxes for the rich even though only 10 % of the population thinks that the rich pay too much in taxes . i do n't know how you can look at that and say , "" the republican party is just to the right of the average american voter . "" now , we could go 15 rounds about why the republicans are a viable electoral force even though their policies are wildly unpopular , but that 's not the subject of this cmv . all i 'm trying to do is prove to you that a 2 party system does n't necessarily encourage moderation . to that end , i provided evidence that the republicans ( one of two parties ) have taken positions that are extreme in both a domestic and global political context . i believe that this demonstration of extreme policies in a two-party system disproves your assertion that 2-party systems encourage moderation . this ignores the fact that 40-60 % of people do n't vote every election . this also ignores the fact that districts are drawn by self-interested partisans , who want to draw the districts such that the general elections are noncompetitive . my point is that the most significant human progress has been because of so-called "" extremists "" , not moderates . you ignore the rest of the world and the preceding thousands of years of humanity in which progress was not made by moderation . maybe moderation is what the western world needs at the moment , but it 's not what made the western world great and it 's not what will make us greater . and as for the rest of the world , they do n't need moderation because they need to make a lot of progress ."
9sg8ij,"the modern governmental constructs currently in america are way too powerful , and directly lead to the polarized and divided political climate that we now have . a lot of people today view politics as some sort of battle . they back their candidate , and anyone else is directly opposing them . however , i believe the underlying issue here is that the political offices , and the government as a whole , are much too powerful . a lot of people are truly fearful during elections because the thought of the opposition winning scares them . they fea that someone they do n't winning could negatively impact there way of life . however , this should n't be a fear , in my opinion . the political offices and government should just be the instruments through which the country runs . it should n't be some battle between side , over who gets to monopolize the law-making for the next two years . at least to me , the centralized power is the issue , not the candidates or politcial powers . am i totally off base here ?","the reason it 's a battle is that you always run into a clash of values . trump and republicans winning meant that people would lose their health coverage ( they still could ) . the deregulation that they 've done over the past two years is hurting people . there is a fair amount of leeway in disagreements between state government and federal government , so you can have things like legal weed in some states , different states have different emissions standards for vehicles , some states refused the medicare expansion under obamacare , etc . so there are a lot of things that the federal government does n't actually affect if your state sees things differently . sure , there are some grants and curriculum initiatives that come from the state or federal level but ultimately what gets taught and who teaches it is a local issue . i partially agree with you , in the sense that candidates and political powers are n't the problems . however , it 's not the magnitude of power the government has as a whole that is a problem , it 's how few different perspectives exist that is . the first-past-the-post voting system in the us makes it impossible for third parties to stay around and be relevant in the long run . we need to escape our two-party system in order to check the power of individual political parties . if we had a different voting system that empowered extra parties and discouraged two-party voting , we would have a much more diverse congress , much more accurate representation , a much more enthusiastic voting base , and , most importantly , a significant reduction in the us-vs-them mindset . multiple political parties that still yield the power to improve society is much better than a two party system that does n't have the power to destroy it ."
9sg0qr,"darkening your skin tone for a halloween costume , a.k.a. “ blackface ” , is not racist there ’s been several highly publicised incidents recently of individuals attracting controversy and being labelled racist for using make up to darken their skin to correlate with the character they have chosen to dress up as . for something to be racist , the act has to be discriminatory or prejudiced towards others of a different race . i do n’t see how this can be considered either of those things . the application of the make up is intended to make a white person look more like the character they are trying to portray . the same way someone would wear a fake body part or a particular garment for their costume . if blackface is racist , can the same be said for people of colour lightening their skin for a halloween costume ? if so , why does it not attract the same feelings of outrage from the general public ? if this is considered socially unacceptable , at what point do we draw the line ? should nun costumes be banned as they could be considered discriminatory towards catholics ? should the keffiyeh be banned from costumes as they could be considered discriminatory to those of middle eastern descent ? should fake noses be banned as they could be considered offensive to jewish people ? i feel we should remember that in many countries , racism is an offence that can be punishable by fines and/or imprisonment , and rightly so , because racism , as mentioned before , is an act that discriminates and/or incites hatred towards those of another race . when we label things like this as racist , i think it is not only irresponsible , but it is dangerous and it can ruin lives . i have no issue with some people being more sensitive and prone to being offended than others , but i do have an issue with their sensitivity being supported by the state and the like-minded mob incessantly pursuing major repercussions upon the individual for something which is not , by definition , remotely racist . my final question is , what is it about “ blackface ” that is considered discriminatory or prejudiced ?","basically , it made something as simple as someone 's skin color and their position in life as something to be used as a trope , as entertainment , and as a joke . \ > if blackface is racist , can the same be said for people of colour lightening their skin for a halloween costume ? nun costumes have n't been used as a tool to make fun of/discriminate against catholics . if you used a fake nose to dress as a jewish person , i imagine many people would be offended . you should look into the history of minstrel shows and white actors/comedians using blackface to understand why it ’s racist hate crimes are a thing , in some countries ( or possibly in some states in the context of the u.s. ) , but literally just being racist , even to the point of openly expressing racist views , is not a crime , as various figures in the united states and elsewhere lately have amply demonstrated ( reddit would also pretty much just have to be shut down if that were the case , as well ) . no one has been , or will be , put in jail for wearing blackface ."

9sel59,"the claim "" the answer to bad speech is more speech "" has limits the view that i want changes is simple : that "" the answer to bad speech is more speech "" is not absolute . like almost all libertarian ideas this is a claim that i really want to agree with , but when it 's accepted as an absolute truth and not as a "" guideline "" it 's easy to see where it can lead . the reason i 'm asking : the founder of gab.com used this line in response to his service being de-facto shut down by it 's hosting providers as a result of media covering the fact that the pittsburgh synagogue shooter used the service to essentially post his intent before "" going in . "" i 'm not making an argument about the value or ethics of gab , so please do n't waste time defending or attacking it unless it 's required to cmv . i 'm also not arguing for government-imposed limits on free speech . i 'm arguing that his claim is only True insofar as parties are willing to speak and listen to each other in good faith . and in america we just do n't have that . & #x200b ; i think there are a few points at which "" the answer to bad speech is more speech "" fails : 1 . the speaker of the "" bad speech "" is n't willing to listen . they 're in an information silo that has an immunity to opposing facts and opinions . example : those who only consume fox news . 2 . the speaker of the "" bad speech "" is n't arguing in good faith . they 'll listen and debate , but will intentionally lie to win the argument . example : claiming the cavaran from honduras contains islamic terrorists without evidence . claiming you actually are protecting medicare and social security while your name is signed to lawsuits that would reduce or eliminate those programs . 3 . the speaker of the "" bad speech "" is done talking , and is acting on their bad speech . example : pittsburgh mass shooting . 4 . the speaker of the "" bad speech "" is actually relying on your absolute protection for free speech to spread bad , dangerous , or violence/hate promoting ideas . example : enemies of the united states within and without that use our passion for the 1st amendment against as well as our own infrastructure to sew discord within our country . so change my view . make me believe that there is no situation in which a bad idea will prevail so long as a better idea is available to overtake it . & #x200b ;","bad speech , when followed by mockery , becomes a much better argument against bad speech . if people utter bad speech behind closed doors ( because it is verboten to express in public ) we miss out on the opportunity to change their minds . people in a free society that allows exchange of ideas are less likely to be seduced by a dumb idea they have seen before . the question then is why you want to restrict speech . stop radicals from taking a bad idea to its any kind of extreme inevitably , when an idea becomes the basis for radicalization , tragedy occurs . in this case , you would be isolating a radical idea - forcing it into an echo chamber and causing it to grow from within that chamber . lets take the pittsburgh shooter , he posted on gab and isolated himself into an ideological echo chamber and radicalized himself to the point where he saw trump as a globalist pawn and chose to "" take matters into his own hands "" and attack a group of jewish people . attacking free speech is n't what would have prevented that attack , eradicating gab could n't have prevented the attack - the only conceivable way to prevent that attack would have been to be able to talk him out of it . even then , how far gone was he ? this is ultimately the problem with pretending there is a one-size-fits-all answer to what is , unfortunately , a situation too complicated , nuanced , and difficult a problem - a problem intrinsic to the human condition - in which restricting the freedom of everyone in society just ca n't solve . in the end , it all comes down to what you conceive of as "" prevail "" in this context . in the end , nothing can ever truly prevent all tragedy , and it would be equally tragic to use such a tragedy to attack one of the core principles of our nation that has sustained our way of life for centuries . your examples all focus on trying to communicate with , or change the mind of , the speaker rather than focusing on other listeners . but every day we can share our stories and beliefs of why they are wrong , do n't represent our country 's values , and should be shunned and rejected . and we can encourage others to oppose them and the politicians who support and encourage them . in summary : censorship does not inhibit morally reprehensible speech , it actually only inhibits speech that the organizing body decides is morally reprehensible . for example , google fired james damore for releasing a memo , not because the memo was full of hate speech or falsities , but because it contradicted the narrative that google wants to engender . in fact , they 're the ones who spread falsities when they defended their decision by saying the memo made claims that women were incapable of being engineers even though no such statement appears in the memo . i do n't know what you think about it , but calling a lie "" good speech "" and the truth "" bad speech "" seems highly orwellian . so if google can not be trusted to decide what speech is good and which is bad , and since i assume you do n't believe trump 's administration can decide what speech is good or bad , who then can be trusted ? many of the problems you mention can actually be solved by more well-crafted and persuasive speech . i think this misunderstands the point of a "" more speech "" response . if you 're arguing in order to change your interlocutor 's position , you are most likely doing it wrong , though there are exceptions with certain contexts . the "" more speech "" solution to "" bad speech "" is showing everyone else that said speech is bad ."
9sdo2f,"blanket legalization of all drugs and all future drugs is inferior to a mix of legalization and prohibition i see a lot of posts and comments these days in favour of blanket legalization . to me this does n't seem terribly well thought out and seems fairly lazy . i think the correct course of action would be a combination of legalization , treatment and prohibition . there needs to be an examination of the value you trade off to legalizing drugs . some drugs will do more societal harm while prohibited while others will have more potential to do harm while legalized . addicts should be treated like patients who need to be cured but imo we still need to attack the sources of some drugs to slow the supply . it needs to be a two pronged approach . i think in many countries this has been the recent trend . a perhaps extreme hypothetical i could use is if there was a new drug that had a 1 in 100 chance of turning the user into someone who is extremely mentally deficient . in a case like that its obvious that legalization would have a more detrimental effect than prohibition .","i think a lot of people are less likely to want blanket legalization and more likely to want total decriminalization . the majority of people can agree that some drugs are just not good for you . despite all populations doing drugs at very similar rates , and despite the black population being about 15 % of the us population , they make up a majority of the population of people jailed and prosecuted for drug crimes . so what people really want , i think , is blanket decriminalization and a rework of the system , not necessarily blanket legalization of all drugs . as we 've seen , regardless of the prohibition they 'll still get the drugs , still do the drugs , and then you 've enabled the profits of organized crime by the prohibition , with all the added detriment to society that entails . part of the argument for legalization is about mitigating all the supply side effects of prohibition , like black markets , violence , increased prison population , etc. . however , i have n't heard of it , based off your description . the status quo ( drugs being illegal ) means that drugs are still produced and sold , but this is done by criminals . these criminals make lots of money from the illegal drug trade . at the same time , there is no quality control , safe work practices , safe disposal , etc. during the creation of the drugs . people are put in danger during the making of drugs ( done in illegal unregulated labs that may well explode , have chemical leaks , etc. ) , the disposal of drug waste ( chemicals are often dropped somewhere outdoors , where people can stumble upon it , not to mention the damage to the environment ) , the consumption of drugs ( nobody knows what is in them ) . by legalizing drugs , we take away the sources of income for a lot of criminals . by making it legal the drugs will be instead produced by honest businesses , who will be regulated ( not just quality control , but also waste disposal , safety regulations , etc. ) . but then we finally get to the difficult part of the conversation - why provide dangerous drugs to people , when there is huge risk in taking those drugs ? first off , there are multiple studies that show us that legalization of drugs does not increase how much that drug gets used . when it is legal and regulated , we can decide when and where this drug is distributed . and we can decide what drugs we put heavy restrictions on and which ones are freely available . for a bad drug like heroin , for example , we may well decide that you are only allowed to get it if you are already addicted , and if you will talk with a psychologist about your drug use , while at the same time providing acces to an addiction clinic if they want to . for less heavy drugs , we may still force you to listen to an explanation of the risks , safe usage guidelines , before supplying them to you . you 'll probably still do xtc whether we provide it or not , but at least if you buy from us we tell you all about safe dosages , what to do when you 're not feeling well , how much you should or should n't drink , etc . this way , on the one hand it will no longer be profitable to illegally manufacture or grow drugs on a large scale , on the other hand , we do not provide free acces to the worst drugs . on the other hand , many drugs will likely fall in the "" less dangerous than alcohol "" category , and will be easily available if you really want them . legalization implies that all drugs would be commercially available and therefore subjected to government regulations and safety standards . there would be "" safety "" nets put into place to make sure you knew exactly what you were getting . this would also mean that companies would pop up to sell all these newly legalized drugs , and companies , are eligible to be sued ."

people of all races enslaved people who shared their race and other races . white europeans were enslaved as were black africans by various institutions and people . slavery was indiscriminate . it was n't until slavery came to the united states that it was decided that slavery was wrong and abolished . it should be seen as a stain on our country that we ever used slavery , but it should also be celebrated that we were the one 's who ended slavery and it should not be considered something that white people engaged in due to racism . perhaps some white people had racist motivations , but , as a nation as a whole , and throughout the majority of history , slavery was not based on race . cmv .","china , the eastern roman empire , and the ottoman empire all practiced another form of slavery which actually gave a lot of political and military power to the slaves . these slaves were owned not by individuals , but , rather , by the government . the ottoman janissaries , as another example , were the most elite infantry force in the ottoman empire , but they were all slaves . their generals were widely respected , and had a great deal of influence over political matters , but they were still slaves . when people in the united states say that slavery was a racist institution , they are specifically talking about the american system of black chattle slavery . this was absolutely a racist institution , and part of the country 's ( especially the south , but not exclusively the south ) institution of white supremacy . any black person in a slave-holding state , regardless of whether they actually were free or not , could be taken into slavery for no other reason than being alive and having black skin . any white person , regardless of education , socioeconomic status , employment , or even whether or not they were a convicted criminal , was superior to any black person . children born to slaves were slaves at birth , and could ( and were ) be bought and sold from as young as the owner wished . there may be a grain of truth in that very early on , when the portuguese , dutch , spanish , british , and french traders began bringing enslaved africans to the americas , they were probably not thinking that only black people deserved to be enslaved , just that they were the most convenient targets . there are records to suggest that they tried to enslave indigenous people in the americas , but the indigenous people did not take well to slavery . africa was close ; the climate was warm enough that african slaves were relatively familiar with the heat found in most of the americas ; and africans tended to not succumb to the tropical diseases which killed many other people in droves . europeans never seemed to seriously consider enslaving other white europeans in the same way as black africans . they wanted the labor of the europeans just as much as they wanted the labor of the africans , but they invented an entirely different institution to compel it : indentured servitude . this was not too far off from slavery ( and some indentured servants even shared quarters with slaves ) , but it was different in that indentured servants had rights , were considered people , and had the ability ( although sometimes only theoretically ) to buy their way out of their servitude . some white europeans who had been convicted of crimes were sentenced to bondage in the americas , which could look similar to slavery , but this was always done for a period of time ( rather than indefinitely ) . also , children born to people sentenced to bondage ( or indentured servants , for that matter ) were born free , not as slaves . as the american slave trade and institution was born , a philosophical framework came up along with it to justify its existence . it claimed that white people were naturally superior to blacks , as evidenced by their superior technology , military might , and culture . therefore , it was only natural that white people should be the masters of blacks , who were better off living as slaves in "" civilized society "" than living free as savages . all these justification were 100 % racist , and were used to continue justifying the slave trade for centuries . it 's evident white europeans had racist intentions when the slave trade started . it pretty quickly changed , with a philosophical framework to justify it , to become specifically anti-black , though . back then almost every nationality was considered a "" race "" rather then the idea that skin color dictates it . like if you went to brittian you would see "" white "" slaves , but very few would be brittian slaves , they would be irish or some other "" race "" of people that were viewed as less then the average citizen . slavery has always had a race based component , but not by what we consider race today . it shows the legal steps of the transatlantic slave trade that showed how structural racism developed hand in hand with slavery in america . it also compares the transatlantic slave trade to previous enslavers and states why the transatlantic trade was unique . first : are we talking about slavery as in the general concept of owning other humans ( which has existed for millennia and long predates the idea of race ) , or are we talking about american slavery ? obviously the primary motivation for wanting slavery is typically wanting free labor . however , if we 're talking about american slavery , racism was a huge factor both in the sense that : racist attitudes and racist pseudoscience like phrenology were used to justify slavery , and race was used as the primary identifier of who was ( or had been ) a slave and who was not . if i kill someone but i have a nice internal motivation for doing it , that person is still dead . in the context of a cmv discussion , nobody ( neither you nor me ) can prove anything about motivation , because we ca n't go inside the minds of anyone else , and especially not people who died a couple hundred years ago . "" there have been plenty institutions of slavery not based on racism . therefore , there were never any institutions of slavery based on racism . "" "" there have been plenty of insults not based on racism . "" there have been plenty of violent attacks not based on racism . "" there have been plenty of discriminatory practices not based on racism . "" there have been plenty of acts of type t without property p. therefore , there were no acts of type t with property p. "" in any case , the only slavery that america abolished was the kind that america practiced , and that kind of slavery was overwhelmingly racist . the theological and scientific ideologies used to prop up slavery were racist — theologians claimed negroes were decended from ham and so condemned to be “ servants or servants ” — scientists claimed negroes had either evolved from a completely different species or that the climate of africa had made them weak willed and simple and so fit to be governed by people from superior climates . earlier forms of slavery enslaved individual people , often prisoners of war . putting them to work was often the least bad option . they hardly every required that the slaves children also become slaves because of the color of their skin . slaves could often buy back their freedom — they were n’t seen as biologically inferior , and slavery was n’t seen as their natural state . american slavery was very different from these early strains of slavery , and the big differences were the mercantile economic system and racism . you talk about slavery in general as not being race based , and then you try to shift into a discussion about american slavery to prove that it was n’t race based . you are applying today 's definition of race on events , that were based entirely on different concepts . the individual "" white "" groups , where the only proper race was seen as anglo-saxon . as in , the slaves are the group of people that are different . as all of those were seen as the trait 's of a race in their time , as much as skin color is in our 's . the scientific racism of the 19th century and its antecedents can be seen as a technology developed , in part , to justify and uphold institutions like the atlantic slave trade . western slavery mostly concentrated in africa , because early slavers assumed that because africans spent most of their time in the sun and working within their communities that they 'd be fit enough to do the labor desired by the spanish & english ( iirc ) other sources i 've read online say that columbus had tried to make slaves out of native americans but many died on the trip back to spain , so they sought cheaper and more effective labor . american slavery was definitely based on racism and americans did n't "" end "" slavery in any meaningful sense outside of america and , even then , it required a very bloody war . that very bloody war was followed by decades of racial based violence and marginalisation . there 's a significant difference between a lot of historical examples of slavery and the type of slavery practiced in the americas . historically , slaves were enslaved for a mix of reasons , like debt , being captured in war , and punishment for crimes . occasionally , there was chattel slavery , which is slavery in which both a person and their offspring are owned as property , akin to owning a farm animal . however , unlike other forms of slavery , there is no particular justification for chattel slavery . it made a certain sort of sense to enslave people to work off their debts , but there is no particular moral justification for chattel slavery . because people are naturally inclined to create reasons for the things they do , some overarching reason had to be created which morally justified owning all these people that had been stolen from their homes . racism is the justification that emerged to explain why it was morally acceptable for white europeans and americans to enslave whatever africans they could . thus , africans had to be naturally inferior to other people , and this defect had to be genetic . you can get into a chicken or the egg question between the slavery and the racism , but they are inextricably intertwined . so , when people are talking about slavery being based on racism , they are referring to a specific type of slavery in a certain region during a certain period . it just happens that when people say "" slavery "" they are generally referring to the trans-atlantic slave trade in the americas . this makes sense because it has extremely high historical significance and represented a type of systemic slavery that had n't been seen previously ."
9scjct,"drafting citizens for war is immoral , and a form of slavery . it 's pretty universally agreed that slavery means forcing people to do work or services against their will . there is the argument that , because drafted soldiers are payed , it 's not slavery . but in my opinion , forcing citizens to do something against their will , and possibly against their own morals is slavery disguised by slapping a paycheck on it . if somebody is kidnapped , and then forced to work as a prostitute , it 's considered by almost everybody to be slavery . i do n't want to put up a strawman , but i only make the comparison to point out the fact that , aside from the "" job "" itself , they 're the same in terms of consent - and therefore , if one is slavery , so is the other , since i 'd presume the type of work does n't matter , since slavery is slavery . i 'm not so much looking to debate the technical definition of slavery , but rather , my belief that the draft is an infringement on human rights and personal freedom . change my view ?","so it 's not a quesiton of general human rights ( again , unless you 're a believer in anarchism ) but whether this particular compulsion is rational and balanced . if you are a believer in anarchism , the answer becomes clear : it is slavery , it does infringe on human rights , and it should be consequently disallowed . but then we get to the good old problem of anarchism where it 's not apparent who 's going to disallow ( and how ) conscription by a local warlord if there 's no state with a functioning monopoly on violence in the first place . it 's ( in the justifiable cases ) a compromise between the freedoms you have to take from the people you draft and the general population 's lives and safety . drafting is closer to imprisonment of criminals then it is to slavery , morally speaking . in a war where mass conscription is necessary , a government is n't drafting people for an economic reason , but to safeguard the nation by any means possible . if a government does n't lock up criminals it endangers the stability of law and order , and if a government does n't conscript in the face of a destructive war it endangers the very nation itself . while drafting can be considered slavery because of its disreguard for free will , it is done for completely justifiable reasons if the war is destructive enough . i mean you 're asking about 2 things draft = immoral and draft = slavery ... the draft is an infringement on human rights and personal freedom , but that does n't make it immoral per se . personally , as a utilitarian , i would argue that if the draft prevents more suffering than it causes it was a moral act . from a more abstract way to look at it though , you said "" i 'd presume the type of work does n't matter , since slavery is slavery . "" but that raises the question of what kind of pressure you consider "" force "" . however , we recognize it as a required obligation of a civil society in the us , extending to the very top . on another , more practical note , conscription also forces democratic countries to consider the choice to go to war much more seriously . by contrast , the us invaded afghanistan with an all-volunteer army and has faced little public pressure to end it , even as it pushes through its 17th year ."
9s7xsg,"human beings are n't made for modern life . - human beings are n't made for globalization : during the stone age , we were supposed to be afraid of the neighboring tribe because they could kill us and/or take our stuff . the stone age only ended a few millennia ago , so humanity still has this bias . when many migrants go to developed countries , the native population of the latter countries start to support potentially xenophobic politicians when stuff goes bad , like the refugee crisis . - human beings are n't made for sudden changes in society : stuff changes too fast nowadays . fifty years ago , black people were badly seen by everyone . ten years ago , including a gay kiss in a kids show was unthinkable . human beings have a very hard time giving up their core ideals and have an open mind . there are people alive today that were in their thirties when racism was still the norm . - human beings are n't made for progressive ideas : in order for progressive ideas to be widespread , the economy needs to be thriving and society needs to be completely safe . when a crisis hits , the rights of historically-repressed groups may be gone . - human beings are n't made to have such a big population : seven and a half billion is the appropriate population of a species of insect , bird or rodent . the homo sapiens is a large animal with a high calorie consumption . it could be sustainable if the technology did n't degrade the environment so much , and some of humanity 's main leaders wo n't do those changes . - human beings are n't made for food overabundance : look at the obesity statistics . - human beings are n't made for cities : human beings only care about the few people close to them . this is why communism only works in small communities . also , stuff in cities is too far away for most people . p.s. : consider the word "" adapted "" instead of "" made "" .","that implies a creator that made humans with a purpose in mind . since we learned that we can adapt environment for our needs there 's no need to evolve and adapt . the problem of modern society is that people eventually lose that ability to adapt environment - even simple things like growing own vegetables is hard for modern people because they never need it . as for obesity statistics - while we evolved we always had a problem to supply enough food without a lot of effort . only when we started to cultivate land and breed fruits , vegetables and domestic animals we started to build a society where food is accessible for everyone . it will take time for us to adapt to it and obesity statistics will drop naturally . as for europe , the refugee crisis is indeed an issue , but it 's certainly not big enough of an issue that it actively threatens the stability of their governments . regarding the rest of the world , take a look at this graph . the number of people living in severe poverty has steadily declined from around 90 % in 1820 to under 15 % in 2010 . your claim that most countries are actively getting worse over time simply is n't supported by the data . for a highly religious nation , the us has done remarkably well in response to changing attitudes on gay marriage . your claim that "" humans are n't made for modern life "" makes it seem as if we need to do a u-turn and stop making so many big , fast changes before we accidentally destroy human civilization . and only the absolute worst-case scenarios of global warming , which are unlikely , would actually threaten human civilization in the long term . you give examples of where humans have adapted pretty fast , and then complain we ca n't adapt to new ideas very fast . but i do n't get this tangent about humans not being able to change their minds or not being able to accept progressive ideas when your own examples show how quick things can change and how people can accept progressive ideas . certainly modern life is not natural , in the sense that humans did not evolve for modern life ."
9s6tnl,"it 's hard to champion for 100 % free speech without allowing for intense radicalization . before i begin this post , i apologize for this being very america-centric . i do apply this post to outside america , but will mostly be using american anecdotes and facts for my argument . i want to clarify that as soon as 2 years ago , i would have disagreed with this statement . i was 18 , new to college , naive , and barely aware of anything outside my own life and environment . i thought sjw 's were a cancer to society and that milo yiannopolous was entertaining . not anymore . with the recent pennsylvania synagogue shooter 's social media presence coming to light , and even the decorations of the pipe bomber 's van , one thing is becoming alarmingly clear - america is becoming plagued by political radicals . this might be caused by trump , it might merely be a symptom . but nobody has fully taken on "" pc culture "" and made it a big deal like trump has . this has led to many people on the right advocating for free speech in the face of censorship , whether it be alex jones ' infowars , the social media site gab which the synagogue shooter used , or the alleged censorship that conservatives complain about on the internet ( despite conservative news sites constantly being among the top 5 news articles shared each and every week on facebook ) . this fight for free speech no longer feels like a fight for hearing everybody out , it has become an excuse . an excuse that allows unfiltered , unchecked opinions to become fact in the brains of readers and listeners . firstly , infowars . this show has constantly used violent rhetoric , implied numerous shootings were False flags using crisis actors in order to convince viewers that legislative action does not need to be taken , and in fact , those calling for this action are attempting to manipulate the minds of americans . secondly , gab . a website that was birthed in the wake of a twitter purge of conservative accounts that were deemed either trolls or robots , in the name of free speech . theoretically , this website was only made on one basis : a twitter platform with no censorship . this is what we would all want , no ? the argument i always hear for allowing any and all speech , is that the calmer , rational ideas will always win . so , this website should be productive for allowing people with views outside of what society deems okay to experience good dialogue ? wrong . this site is teeming with racists , islamophobes , anti-semites , sexists , homophobes , transphobes , you name it . it is now a twitter site for specifically people who prescribe to the same political views as the synagogue shooter . the gab ceo did n't necessarily want this . his only selling point on the website , is that there is no report button on posts . so how does it turn into a haven for the most hateful people ? simply because of the lack of negative feedback . now , the site is an echo-chamber , where nobody 's thoughts are challenged , and the community around you only nudges each other towards higher radicalization . this is very diabolical , but this kind of content is not made specifically to radicalize people . it is to drive revenue , and it 's not only happening in these sites which people self-segregate and communicate within ( which , is super easy thanks to the internet ) . on sites like facebook and youtube , fake news and incendiary articles are served up , as the sites are simply serving people what they 're most likely to click on , and drive ad revenue . watch a couple ben shapiro or fox news clips on youtube , now your recommendations fill with anti-sjw videos , and clips of college liberals behaving recklessly , and your perception changes in an instant . before youtube banned infowars , this travel down the rabbit hole would almost always lead to infowars . blocking people from accidentally radicalizing themselves is incredibly important , since online awareness is quite low in people - and not to mention each person is being served up a different home page on each one of their phones and computers . just like environmental regulations are placed on companies to stop negative effects on the environment for the sake of money , we must take steps as a society to progress further and further , and block hateful and incendiary speech . the argument then becomes "" what is hateful and incendiary ? "" , which should n't be too hard to tell . there are way too many people now that do not understand how the views they hold are detrimental to society , and any popular entity sharing views which are easily disprovable and shockingly disparaging should face apprehension . free speech deserves more nuance than "" you should be allowed to say whatever you want as long as you 're not threatening an individual "" .","if twitter kicks off even a few of its most obnoxious bigots and gab does n't , then non-bigots considering using either platform quickly find that twitter conversations are more to their liking . they leave gab for twitter even if they would ordinarily prefer to avoid censorship . meanwhile , the most obnoxious bigots can not stay on twitter and ordinary bigots do n't care . thus , the ratio of obnoxious bigots : normal people becomes ever higher on gab than twitter , until eventually only the bigots remain . but as nassim taleb points out , there are rare black swans that are hard to imagine , that are far more powerful than that - and the methods of stabilization ( censorship ) that might help prevent this kind of modern day attack are destabilizing against the worst events . there 's 2 ways to make hate speech laws , either a list of predetermined words that count as hate speech or letting the courts decide . the first way would make all slurs illegal for all people , which would have the ( presumably ) unintended side effect of disproportionately affecting black people saying the n word . leaving it up for interpretation may seem better since it 's a way to get away with targeting white people , however once the free speech threshold is broken , how long before speaking out against the government is interpreted as hate speech ? if you look at history , a lot of the most intensely radical societies had little to no free speech at all , and this is still the case today . the societies today that are the worst for democracy , justice , treatment of minorities , etc all severely limit speech . the problem with well meaning speech codes is that they eventually become a weapon used by whoever happens to be in power to silence critics and people they dislike . nobody "" accidentally radicalizes themselves "" - they go down the proverbial rabbit hole because they see some piece of received wisdom repeated ad-infinitum and smell bs ( remember how all of the major networks were 100 % sure hillary would win ? ) if the mainstream media were more balanced , you would receive a more even treatment of the left and the right , but you do n't . we no longer have a common fact set ( news program watched by both the left and the right ) and this has nothing to do with free speech which we have had for hundreds of years . free speech has never been "" let 's hear this person out "" . free speech does not mean freedom from criticism or backlash . i think you are seeing threats and thinking it comes under free speech , which it does n't . it started because it was created by a certain group of people and promoted by that certain group of people . these people already had these opinions when they first started to use the website . it 's a hateful place because it was used by people who were hateful on twitter but got banned . it is really difficult to get rid of racism if you do n't know who the racists are . it allows you to identify these people and helps you actually try and change their minds . once you give people the power to limit the extreme opinions it will be a slippery slope . then they came for the trade unionists , and i did not speak out — the uk has seen a person charged with hate speech because she used the dictionary definition of the word "" woman "" on a billboard and a trans person considered that to be hate speech . so the truth is now being called hate speech by some . remove the need to threaten a group or individual directly and then there is nothing but subjective views about what is or is n't hate to base your proposed censorship upon . if you start banning questioning of history or events then that leads to there needing to be some ultimate authority who has the truth . infowars also heavily reported on how the cia was involved in selling crack cocaine to the inner cities in the us which was obviously denied for years by the officials . same as they reported years before wikileaks confirmed the vault 7 documents that the cia were in partnership with electronics companies to install microphones and cameras that recorded consumers covertly and could be tapped into at any time . mainstream media labelled anybody who believed that to be "" tin foil hat "" wearing conspiracy nuts . i think alex jones talks mostly nonsense , but i 'd rather every idea was judged on it 's own merits rather than calling for him to be banned , which only lends more credibility in the eyes of those already distrustful of the mainstream media as it seems like there must be a reason they wo n't let his voice be heard and maybe it 's because he really is speaking truth to power and has the authorities worried . which is exactly what google has stated they planned to do along with cass sunstein and his book "" nudge "" who claims he wants to "" nudge "" people away from "" conspiracy theories "" and basically people being too stupid to figure out the truth for themselves . that was written around colleges on paper and people called that hate speech . there are extremists online , but it 's mainstream media promoting those extremists too because that 's what makes people click . do n't imagine the people restricting free speech to be your friend , imagine the people who put the restrictions to be the least likable party around . you can not place restrictions on any type of non-threatening speech because once you ban one type of speech , it becomes a subjective determination by the people in power — characteristic of dictatorships . the reason we see so many radicals today is because people ca n't get reliable news from any major organization . there is no major news outlet with a credible reputation , and although youtube can be an avenue for better news , google does n't care about anything but their bottom line , and will readily give people exaggerated , outraging content that serves to further radicalize people , while hiding good arguments that the user might disagree with . i think that , rather than restricting speech , we should provide people with a news organization that is actually trustworthy . a government funded news organization that does n't need click-bait and outrage to exists is probably the most simple solution , but it would be hard to get people to trust it , and it could be corruptible if it is n't properly established . there are way too many people now that do not understand how the views they hold are detrimental to society if it is easy to tell what is hateful , then why do n't people understand that their views are detrimental ? \ > with the recent pennsylvania synagogue shooter 's social media presence coming to light , and even the decorations of the pipe bomber 's van , one thing is becoming alarmingly clear - america is becoming plagued by political radicals . i 'm skeptical that two incidents of violence should mean we revisit free speech . we generally see hate crimes declining over time , even with free speech . who are you to tell me what ideas and opinions i 'm allowed to hear and what books i can read ? out of curiosity , who would you give the job of deciding for you what books you 're not sensible enough to read ? clarifying question : are you arguing for private restrictions on speech ( like those implemented by twitter , facebook , reddit , etc ) , or are you advocating for government intervention ? the algorithm 's creation of echo chambers is what lead to radicalization . if watching two conservative videos did n't fill your feed with slightly more extreme conservative videos , then the echo chamber would never have been created . radicalization would not happen to people are n't already radicalized . similar algorithms exist on other platforms , too , from twitter to facebook to even google searches , which further exacerbate the echo chamber effect . the solution to radicalization here is not to ban it . twitter 's banning of conservatives caused them to flock to an even tighter echo chamber . youtube 's banning of alex jones made him seem more sympathetic to his followers , who all flocked to another even tighter echo chamber . the best solution would be to place regulations on these algorithms , to make sure the various echo chambers never start in the first place . i 'd argue it 's relatively easy to argue for argue for 100 % free speech and oppose radicalisation . if people are allowed to say whatever they want and media organisations operate freely , then the best ideas would win out imo . the problem is that the most prominent supporters of "" free speech "" are often radicals who call for free speech just because they 're the first group who would be punished if any limits were brought in ( i.e. ill-informed , dishonest bigots ) . the same groups you mentioned ( e.g. info wars , trump supporters ) often call for free speech when demonising migrants and jews but they do n't actually care about hearing different opinions or about hearing new information . the net result is that their calls for ' free speech ' is just them calling for greater tolerance of their radical hate speech while they completely ignore the sources and facts they dislike . they are also usually quick to call for censorship of "" fake news "" or punishments to "" paid protesters "" . these groups are n't really calling for different opinions or information . it 's them delegitimising facts and pushing for tolerance of their hateful opinions . real free speech can respect both and properly distinguish between both which would allow for 100 % free speech and fight radicalisation . the problem is that many call for free speech while ignoring facts and speech they dislike but this hypocrisy is n't necessary for people genuinely interested in free speech . free speech means an unrestricted marketplace of speech is allowed by the government . the entire though behind free speech is simply this : allow anyone that wishes to have a voice . the theory behind it is that good ideas and acceptable ideas will win out and bad ideas and immoral ideas will be exposed and countered by better ideas . what many people seem to be saying now is this : "" we do not believe that good ideas will win out over bad ideas ... on top of that , we want to be the judge of what is a good idea and a bad idea . we do not want those who think differently from us to have free speech because more people may follow them , then us "" i believe that good ideas will win out and bad ideas will be exposed for what they are . once you create a central authority who gets to approve and censor acceptable speech , you have literally created an authoritarian society ."

"" this is a poor definition because rape culture implies a society that encourages or at least tolerates rape . steven crowder got it confused when he made a video on the topic despite him having nearly 3 million subscribers ( and a whole crew who could have checked the definition that is the main thesis of his video ) . it was my thought as well when i first heard the term . words & phrases mean what people use them as , and if virtually every person uses rape culture to mean a society that encourages or tolerates rape then either the phrase is wrong or the definition is wrong . in addition , the definition of rape culture is a moot point because while it is True that society does trivialize and normalize rape ( especially in places like prisons ) , society trivializes and normalizes virtually everything . there 's a [ insert anything here ] culture . there 's a murder culture because society trivializes and normalizes murder . there 's an abortion culture because society trivializes and normalizes abortion . if something can be joked about , it can be trivialized and normalized ( because that 's what jokes do ) . the definition of rape culture is a poor definition . p.s. i know that there are different definitions of rape culture but this is the first one that came up when i googled it and the definition in wikipedia says something quite similar to it .","it does n't trivialize and normalize drinking other people 's vomit . rape should n't be normalized and trivialized , so if it is , we should talk about it and change it , right ? it does n't matter what else society trivializes ; that 's totally irrelevant . usually when sociologists talk about “ rape culture ” it ’s not as a way to classify different cultures — it ’s not used like “ matrilineal ” or “ tribal . ” every culture has within it a rape-culture and a consent-culture , just as every culture has within it a culture that promotes war and a culture that promotes peace . it ’s a good thing that people working in the social sciences are trying to figure out what parts of our culture make people more prone to sexual violence . and it makes sense that they ’d have a shorthand word for it , instead of having to continually say “ parts of a culture that make people more prone to sexual violence . ” i do n't think the issue is necessarily if there is a culture , i think arguments can be made for anything to be a culture . the issue is how pervasive the culture is , which rape culture is very . because people are ignorant about a concept does n't change the meaning of that concept . and because someone , an individual , trivializes something does n't mean society trivializes that thing . but , just because there are holocaust jokes does n't mean that our society trivializes the holocaust ."
9s5l14,"being against abortions is absolutely stupid . hear me out : when you have an abortion : you prevent getting a baby by killing the not yet developed infant . this can be done for a lot of reasons but basically , you do it to avoid getting a baby . so now i ask you : are you against condoms ? all they do is prevent you from getting a baby too ? okay , so basically you ’re against not having babies . does that mean you are against having periods then ? i mean , when you have your period , your body disposes the egg cells , killing what would have been a child . if you ’re against abortions , should n’t you then be against getting periods too ?","if an egg is left alone it 'll never develop into a child . if a fetus or embryo is left alone there is a good chance it will develop into a child . being against abortions is n’t the same as other birth control such as stated condoms . i ’m on the border line with pro life and pro choice but i do believe as well as many others think that abortion is stupid and it should be the expecting mothers last option.there are many other options in birth control such as the pill , the shot , iud , and many more . in many cases many women over use this privilege and do n’t realize what they are doing to themselves emotionally not physically . as condoms they are preventing to create a baby but having a abortion is killing the already developing baby who is attached to the mother . condoms stop the sperm from reaching the egg but for abortions it is detaching the baby while it is being created from inside the mother ’s womb . this is a reason i would say it is stupid because there are many other ways to prevent the sperm reaching the egg so people can avoid creating a embryo . using other birth control such as the pill would often make women miss periods this also helps not creating a embryo instead of having to abort the fetus . if it is a condom or missing periods they ’re both preventing to in create a embryo not destroy it while it ’s already in the process of being created . being against abortion is n't stupid , its just placing that arbitrary l8ne at conception instead of birth most of the rhetoric and perception humans have of their own humanity has been developed over the past few thousands of years of civilization . but certainly our view of what abortion is has been rooted in a time before people knew what cells were . that there 's an egg and a sperm does n't change what 's always been happening , and humanity is n't a gene - it 's a moral perspective . if you 're conflating periods with condoms then you 'd have to conflate abstinence with condoms and therefore periods . abortion is vastly more expensive , places more strain on our healthcare system , and is harder on the women that have them than birth control . on the other hand a diploid cell after fertilization has potential to become a baby . your comparing apples to oranges when it comes to fetuses and sperm in a condom . there is a question that decides one ’s position on this issue , if one ’s morals lean utilitarian . you turn around and see a large collection of petri dishes about the size of s brief case labeled “ 1000 human zygotes ” and a screaming baby next to it . your position on when life starts ( conception vs birth ) will be apparent in your answer . the main argument in the anti abortion movement is that human life begins at conception , so condoms and contraceptive pills are not in the main discussion . people who oppose abortion do it because they believe there 's a baby in the uterus , not just a collection of cells . so their main concern is not about preventing a baby , but about letting it live . the way i 'd rephrase your point is that there are literally uncountable number of necessary conditions for a baby and a fetus is not a sufficient condition for a baby . mom had to have sex with dad -- obviously it 's nuts to say they were therefore obligated to have sex , because refraining from doing so means nonexistence of baby . the belief of many is that life starts at conception . using contraceptives and birth control stops the conception from taking place so life has yet to start . although it is rare , there are surviving premature babies who were born before the us abortion limit . sperm/eggs do not fulfill some of these requirements and thus can not be considered "" life "" yet . the crux of the disagreement is over whether , or at what stage of pregnancy , and unborn fetus 's right to life outweighs the mother 's right to terminate the pregnancy . most scientists say an unborn baby gains sentience/consciousness anywhere between week 20 and week 28 . also at this time is when scientist says a baby begins to start feeling pain . in fact , when doctors conduct surgery on fetuses they use anesthesia . many scientists right now are saying that when aborting an unborn baby after like week 20 , anesthesia should be used as well if you think it 's wrong at any point , then you are against abortion at that point going forward . however , life in it of itself does not grant value or rights . we do n't extend human rights to any species but humans . a human embryo is a life , and it 's species is human . so a human embryo is a human life and therefore deserves to have it 's rights protected ."
9s4whm,"statutes of limitations on rape should be abolished a statute of limitations is a window of time after a crime for it to be prosecuted . many crimes have statutes of limitations . for example , you can not be held liable for stealing a pack of gum 25 years after the crime . this can be beneficial in a situation where the case is cold and all the evidence is too old , but many of these laws were introduced when dna evidence and other technological advancements allow older evidence to be admissible . some crimes , such as first-degree murder , generally have no statute of limitations . with the recent flare up of allegations of sexual assault and even rape from the #metoo movement , many of the nitty-gritty details of these cases are becoming public knowledge . this is especially important because many rape victims wait years if not decades before reporting , or are persuaded not to come forward by officers or confidants . as mentioned in the last linked article , two high-profile cases : harvey weinstein and bill cosby , have been handicapped by statutes of limitations . in cosby 's case , many of the ( apologies if i should say alleged ) assaults occurred in california decades ago when the state has a 10 year statute . to me , it seems incredibly wrong that even a single rape case can not be tried because of a statute of limitations . yes , old evidence may not be as reliable as fresher eye-witness testimony . however , with the advances in technology in the past dozen or so years , is it not time for these laws to be updated ? especially given that many women wait years to come forwards for a multitude of ( in my opinion valid ) reasons . another , perhaps semi-tangential , part of this argument has to do with the rape kit backlog . basically , hundreds if not thousands of rape kits containing possibly needed testimony to put away an unknown number of rapists are just sitting in storage , untested . if someone were sexually assaulted and went to the police , getting a full rape kit , their case may still go cold for years anyways . how is it fair that these victims are forced to lose their chance to prosecute their attackers due to a massive systemic backlog ? anyways , i definitely could have ( and probably did ) miss some crucial details so i 'm interested in how my view should be changed ! am i being unrealistic ? too harsh on the rights of the accused ? cmv !","to make a very long story short , rape cases often come down to a "" he said , she said "" because of lack of evidence . along with the massive backlog of rape kits is how invasive and delicate the actual sane exam is . it 's a very long process ( up to 10 hours is n't unheard of in some areas ) , and requires the victim completely expose themselves to a complete stranger ( no one but the victim and administering nurse are allowed in the exam room ) . on top of how uncomfortable the process is ( and that 's a severe understatement ) , often the most crucial evidence is gone by the time of the exam . to actually get all of the evidence possible , a victim should immediately go to the hospital for a sane exam after the crime occurs , but that 's just not how the brain processes trauma like that . getting an exam is probably the furthest thing from any victim 's mind , and the normal response for many is instead to try and clean themselves in some capacity ( often in an attempt to both regain control over themselves and feel less violated ) . while this is a 100 % natural and normal response , unfortunately , this also washes off a lot of dna evidence that can be used to prove who the perpetrator was , and i doubt an advancements in technology will allow testing for dna that physically is n't there . dna is n't the only way to prove a case , but it is usually one of the strongest pieces of evidence available and courts operate on the presumption of innocent until proven guilty , so without it , it 's easy for a defense to poke holes in an argument , especially since most victims know their assailant . for instance , you can demonstrate that persons a and b were in the same location , but without dna evidence you ca n't necessarily demonstrate that anything else happened ( barring photo/video evidence , but that is rarely available ) . witness testimony is a possibility , but as time goes on , these are likely to become more and more unreliable , especially so because the witnesses and perpetrator are not as likely to remember the event in as strong of detail as the victim . unfortunately it 's in the nature of the crime for little evidence to be available , and i do n't think adding more time for victims to come forward will change that . this is n't to say that victims should n't come forward or that the conviction rate is perfectly okay as-is , but just that time is n't going to fix it . rather , i think because of the sensitivity of the matter , evidence preservation immediately after the assault is what needs to be improved . extending the statute would not help the rape kit backlog problem . the supreme court has held that statutes of limitations can not be retroactively extended . the legislature can not reach back in time and bring that crime back to life . many have noted the practical need for statutes of limitations , including op , such as protecting defendants from nebulous charges , cases where they 've lost evidence to defend themselves given the time gap , or the fact that memory degrades ( and thus testimony reliability ) degrades over time . i think it 'd be interesting to attempt a more morally-oriented case too . one can envision a case where a vindictive partner is waiting for an opportunistic time to ruin the defendant 's life , statutes of limitations help defend against moral hazards on the part of the prosecution . in another case , presuming the defendant is guilty , he could have turned his life around in the meantime , sincerely atoned , and genuinely more than made up for his crimes against the broader society ; he would have ' served his sentence ' through the guilt that plagued him and conscientious hard-work and sacrifice . last , assuming people have an obligation to serve justice , statutes of limitation can also encourage victims , overwhelmed by shame and embarrassment , to come forward sooner so that justice might be served more effectively . in any case where you 're relying so heavily on people 's perceptions a statute of limitations is quite important because humans barely remember accurately what happened a week ago let alone 25 years ago . one reason to have a statute of limitations is to protect defendants by allowing them to preserve and present evidence in their defense . if you accuse me of a crime from last week or last year , i can produce eyewitnesses that can testify to my location , my phone records , and all sorts of exonerating evidence . if you accuse me of the same crime from october of 1988 , i wouldnt be able to provide that sort of evidence . that can be especially damning if the accuser preserves evidence indicating guilt , but the defendant ca n’t preserve evidence indicating innocence . one argument i have heard ( not sure how much i believe it ) is that removing the statute of limitations would leave rapists more afraid , which would make them more likely to kill in order to ensure their victim never came forward putting aside a number of issues with your post like that i do n't think the push for removal of sol is legally based but an attempt at fear-mongering and feminist police-stating , there are some issues with the concept . first and most obvious is the increasingly nebulous definition of "" rape "" and "" sexual assault "" by leftwing groups and individuals . one of the issues in the types of cases #metoo raises is women deciding uncomfortable interactions 30 years ago now constitutes rape and ruin otherwise decent men who pay their taxes and contribute to society . one of the many purposes of sol is to assist the accused in defending themselves especially from opportunistic and nebulous charges , which is important on sex based crimes because people can often be convinced they were assaulted or that there was malicious intent behind actions when there was not . i believe the proper legal language is that events occuring past the sol are more likely to serve malicious purposes , rather than legal ones ; if she did n't report her assault 30 yrs ago , why exactly is she reporting it now ... ? another issue is that if all the evidence is gone , and rape/assault cases are almost always "" he said/she said "" affairs to begin with , one party may not even remember the event and so is legally unable to defend themselves . removing the statute of limitations of sex based crimes is basically a large step towards a 1984 ' esque state where "" tommy "" disappears from work because he got metoo'ed after touching a woman 's shoulder the wrong way . just stop by the innocence project and see how hard it is to prove innocence decades later . the number you are looking for is in the hundreds of thousands , and while a significant issue i do want to note that many rape kits have no reason to be tested since the accused already concedes to having sex with the victim and the question is one of consent . statutes of limitations exist because the defendant may lose evidence that is used to defend themselves . character witnesses and witnesses for an alibi may move away or die , they may forget where they were on that specific day , they may forget many details of the event that would make their testimony less credible and make it seem as though they are intentionally lying ( which would cause an innocent person to be more likely to go to prison ) . i started to agree with you based on the backlog of rape kits , but who ’s to say someone did not consent to sex and then get a rape kit done to intentionally screw their partner , maybe in the event of a nasty breakup with child custody issues ? the defendant would need evidence to defend themselves , such as maybe texts in which the accuser invited them over and offered to have sex with them , which would be lost over time . lastly , the statute of limitations puts pressure on rape kit testing . there is a huge backlog , and that ’s a major problem . if there ’s no statute of limitations for rape , then the rape kit testing crisis is “ problem solved ” and maybe the victim dies of old age without ever getting justice ."
9s34n1,"all labels to identify activists or certain groups of people in general ( ex.feminist , antifa , alt-right , liberal ) are hurting society more than they are helping . i strongly believe terms used to identify large groups of people who support a certain cause used to show simply where you stood in the discussion , in recent years , however , they have been used to identify a person . social media has perpetuated this judge a book by its cover mindset , allowing these terms to make 2-dimensional caricatures out of regular people that , at times , have opinions that do n’t completely align with the group they are supporting , but they are lumped in with the group as a whole anyway . these labels have become stereotypes , something we ’re supposed to avoid as a civilized society , so that the country does n’t divide into tribal mentality . when someone does n’t like an opinion of another person , instead of discussing it , they label one another , “ well you ’re just a filthy liberal/alt-right because of that opinion , ” this is incredibly detrimental to society . for us to unify the us again we need to relinquish these labels all together , or at least give them less power , so that we can go back to discussing issues civilly . these stereotypes/labels give the opposite effect of turning people towards their causes , because the public ’s view of them is easily manipulated and they are shown as more radical in the media than some actually are . we need to go back to when we understood that people are individuals with their own thoughts and opinions , and that grouping people simplifies an individual dramatically , allowing hate and prejudice to fill in the blanks . change my view if you believe that the current way society identifies people actually benefits us in any way .","malign other groups , usually for being dumb enough for not being in their group . we ’ve had these sorts of labels since time immemorial . we need to revitalize support for tolerance and free speech , which are sadly things many people today seem to have either redefined or not properly learned about to begin with . i ca n’t count the number of people i ’ve heard tell me that tolerance does not include being tolerant of intolerance , and therefore being intolerant of anyone you deem intolerant is morally justified . and people who support deplatforming argue that it is n’t a violation of free speech , because free speech is only a guarantee against censorship from the government . they refuse to see how the spirit of the phrase is nonetheless being violated when private entities engage in censorship as well , and that it does real societal harm when monolithic corporations like google and facebook engage in it . what has shocked and increasingly depresses me is how the left has abandoned its adherence of the principles i mentioned above and seems more and more regressive with each passing year . in their bid to rid the world of racism and sexism , they ’ve become racist and sexist themselves , and redefined those terms to make racism/sexism against white men exceptions — which is to say , they ’re excusing themselves of the same things they ’re accusing others of . the only people “ winning ” these days are extremists on both sides . and i have a feeling that ’s not going to change until it gets so bad that moderates like me , who are unwilling to vote for either party , reach a critical mass and create a True third option . the labels and distinctions between categories of people and activists can be neutral . however people tend to dehumanize , condemn , despise groups of people they disagree with or do not understand . we are living in time when political discussion is focused on turning out the voters , not changing opinions , and scaring people by pointing out vicious “ feminists ” or bloodthirsty “ gun nuts ” gets voters excited . it has also been shown that people judge and define other people as having character flaws but when they themselves are guilty of the same actions , blame it on circumstance ( you drive too fast because you are a jerk , i drive too fast because i have to get to work and keep up with these drivers ) . we define in order to understand , but those definitions get in the way of perceiving the unknown . , is used to dismiss in order not to question or further consider a different point of view ."
9s2btr,"society needs to be more critical of low-income families having children . the crux of my argument is that families who are below the poverty line - i 'll address the technical issue of this term soon - should certainly not be incentivsed by the government to have children ( i.e. through pro-natalist policies or generous welfare grants ) , and societal pressure should be mounted against these families to abstain from procreation . on poverty : there are many conceptions we could use , relative poverty is obviously relative and fluctuates hugely throughout the world . but an inability of a family to afford basic living costs without external assistance would constitute my definition of poverty , or at least explain how i 'm using poverty , in this case . children who are born into poverty-stricken homes often do n't fare well in life , and are often exposed to criminality , and a lack of life prospects . cmv","there are two feasible alternatives here , and only two : we let children go hungry and homeless , or the government starts taking away children from otherwise loving parents just because they 're poor . option 1 is not acceptable in a first world country , option 2 would massively increase the cost of the child welfare system , lead to worse outcomes for the kids , and arguably be a massive dystopian overreach of government power . the idea that in modern society we would create poverty and then make people unfit to breed is insanely cruel . by that measure , the best way to reduce birth rates would be to make people less poor , in which case a well designed welfare system would actually be helpful to achieving your goals . the more successful a family is , the less they need to have kids . if you want your family to go on , you need multiple kids . you could get ill at any point in the future and you better hope you have kids able to take care of you because its not like you can afford to go hire help . you 're fine retiring because you 've worked a corporate gig your whole life you do n't care about its not like you 're going to destroy a family farm that has been in your families name for generations . you do n't need help around the house or if you do you could buy it on the labor market much cheaper than it costs to raise a kid . you 'll never match the pressure that living in poverty already forces you to live under . having random people ( read : society ) tell you you 're an awful person on top of it seems unlikely to change anything . the uk just introduced ( or will introduce ) a new policy that child support will only be paid for 2 children ( twins , triplets obviously are different cases ) which in theory should cause low income families to stop having children while only looking for an extra pay check ( it ’s disgusting but people actually do it ) when looking at the countries with the fastest growing populations , niger and mali come up as the top two with over 6 kids per family ... on average . the replacement rate is 2 children per family to keep the population level more or less the same . and 6-7 is average , meaning many families in those countries have more than that . there are dozens of countries with an average of over 5 children per family , and none of them are particularly well off . moreover third world countries are more likely to use fossil fuels due to costs , so even if first world countries manage to move towards renewable energy , we 're going to have this rapidly growing population in the third world still using dirty energy sources ( yay climate change ! ) we should be critical as to how many kids people in poverty have . i know single mother households will actually have more children simply to get more welfare , and that 's an issue . it is True that poor kids are more expensive to a society than rich kids . if you discourage poor people from having children you will miss out on the benefits of those future adults & their contribution to society . you may only have to invest 1 dollar for every 10 dollars worth of benefit you get from a rich kid . if you have to invest 5 dollars for every 10 dollars of benefit you get from a poor kid , it ’s still a damn fine deal . do n’t discount all the benefits you receive by not being a terrible person trying to initiate a caste system . the only reason poor kids fare poorly is because we are too selfish , short sighted , and callous to invest in them . i live in poland , and here the government had a different solution to the problem , by starting a kind of a "" basic income "" program , but only limited to families with children . that way , it allows poorer families to afford to raise children without falling into poverty , and also incentivize people to have children in order to reverse declining birth rates , which are a problem for the country . it is a well-known fact that birth rate drops as income increases . a result of that is that western countries generally now have a sub-replacement birth rate which means that not enough children are being born to replace the population that lives there . if we start disincentivizing poorer people from having children then the birth rates would drop even further and the aging of the population would increase even more . in essence , all you 'd accomplish is that you 'd heavily shrink the population within the next 100 years , something that is insanely detrimental for the overall economy . it would be against the spirit of the right to family life if society then turned around and expected poor people to refrain from enjoying their right to family life . instead , society should take this as a reason to offer better support and facilities to prevent that those children wo n't fare well in life . and with punishment you make the situation of poor people that much shittier , which manifest 's with increased problems . so if your motivation is to actually decrease the rate at which poor people have children . it 's not like one can just offload the child to compensate . what should be done ( if anything ) with the high income large family units that are using corporations to take money away from low income families with small and large family units ? ( it seems that high income large family units use corporations from low income families and low income families use the government to take money away from the high income families . ) having children can be argued to be the purpose of life overall . we have the ressources to feed all of them a proper diet , allow them proper education and set them on a good path for life . yes , you can have too many people , but that would be a different reason to limit having children than poverty . cost can never determine this because it varies wildly by culture what 's even considered a basic living as well as how expensive it is to achieve whatever that standard this is . external assistance is also extremely vague and most people get unrecognized assistance , instead people take more issue with government assistance specifically . being born to wealthy , even middle class , parents mean you had external assistance of some sort for most of your life to some degree . the only reason you seem to give is some kind of unacceptable generalisation ( "" poor people are unable to raise their children well "" ; "" poor children will go on to lead unhappy lives "" ) that arguably does n't even stand a general reality check , certainly not one that takes individual cases into account . how do you suppose we help the children that are born to low-income families and at the same time punish their parents ? the people living in poverty are people who deserve all the individual rights , freedoms , comforts , and experiences of humanity . you are reducing people to an abstraction and treating them as statistics , which is downright inhuman . besides that , i live in a country ( america ) with poor outcomes for poor children as you say , yet we know that we have the resources to ensure no child ( and even no person ) lives in poverty . why is n't the solution applying our resources correctly to fight and end abject poverty rather than reduce the poor to an abstraction and set rules or goals for what they do based on statistics ? there was recently a report on the actual costs various things , including ending childhood poverty and poverty in general , and childhood poverty was a drop in the bucket while poverty in general was barely more expensive than the recent richie rich tax cut . we should n't blame or change the poor for poverty . blaming or pressuring the poor has not ever helped us reduce or end poverty but the war on poverty was working before we cut services and it could work again . we can eliminate poverty but not while thinking poor people are the problem as your assertion requires ."
9s1eb1,"monogamy is not the most realistic outcome in many long-term relationships to preface all of this ; no , i am not a cheater . nor do i endorse cheating . however , anecdotally in my experience , far more long-term relationships and marriages are plagued by cheating than not . i 'm also not endorsing the "" men are trash "" or "" women are naturally sluts "" viewpoints . i simply believe that if ( conservatively ) 40 % of marriages experience infidelity , we probably should n't be nearly as shocked or enraged as we tend to be societally when someone is unfaithful . i do n't think we should ever believe that rape victims should be held accountable for a rapist 's actions , not that they can elicit that behavior from a rapost . realistically , i think it 's stupid to walk around drunk alone at night and wo n't ever do so on my own . no , it would n't be my fault , but i 'd rather be pragmatic about risk assessment . similarly , i would never say cheating is expected . but should it be held as so "" unexpected "" when it 's nearly endemic to almost half of long term relationships ? eric anderson indicated that 78 % of the men he interviewed had cheated on their partners . why do we hold onto the idea that this makes you : a. ) a bad person in other arenas concerning morality and b. ) something that just could n't happen to yourself ? does n't that seem deluded , when considering those statistics ? disclaimer : have been around a lot of military marriages , this may influence my viewpoint more than i 'd like to think .","i would suggest that just because perhaps there are a lot of relationships in which there is cheating does n't mean that such an event is desirable . because with cheating , part of it is the decision that the relationship is n't sustainable . you 're saying that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with , and who you will raise kids with and will spend the rest of your life supporting and being supported by can not offer you enough for it to be worth not cheating . i 've found an article suggesting that something between 15-20 % of everyone admits to cheating . so , assuming i 'm right , the statistics do n't support what you 're saying , especially since about 40 % say that their relationship collapsed as a result of it , and a further number say that they 're not on good terms with their partner . monogamy may not always be the outcome , but it 's the only outcome which a couple should aspire to , because failing to live up to it is how the relationship falls apart . something occurring frequently does not make it any less bad , and so one should be as mad as they please at a cheater ."
9rze83,"hate speech can be considered a form of defamation so it 's not unreasonable to have laws on it i 'm not like 110 % on this one but i 'm interested in seeing discussion of the idea at least . to summarize : we 'll define hate speech as “ dehumanizing or prejudiced speech directed at a group of people which is likely to increase harm against that group of people "" we 'll assume that courts are generally reasonable as the jury can serve as a representative group of people for that location , so the common ideology of that area will be reflected decently in a court . so the question of "" where do we draw the line on what counts as hate speech ?

"" is resolved defamation laws protect a person from being potentially harmed by a mob , e.g. you ca n't accuse a random person of pedophilia online because it could lead to someone trying to take vigilante action , hurt their employment , etc . hate speech directed at a ~ ~ minority ~ ~ group will likely have the same effect as defamation except on a group instead of an individual , therefore it 's not unreasonable to create laws against it","that means : defamation is okay for some people , but not for other people . you changed that , but there are many proponents of rules against "" hate speech "" who honestly believe that , and that 's one reason why people are suspicious of hate speech laws . defamation laws occasionally protect people from being hurt by a mob , but that does n't mean that anything that could lead to someone being hurt by a mob is defamation . it 's not even like protecting from a mob is the historical purpose or anything like the main use of defamation laws : a lot of it is about having a ' good name ' not just ' not being pursued with pitchforks ' this reads to me a bit like an argument that one of the purposes of burglar alarms is to make people feel safe at home , so it must be justified to allow everyone to keep an assault rifle at home because that also might make people feel safe . more broadly , i can see the point that some hate speech might be group-defamatory in some sense . if someone said ' i hate john smith , i wish he 'd just go away ' that would not be defamation . if someone said that but replaced john smith with certain group identities , many would treat it as a hate crime . finally , on juries drawing the line , juries are meant interpret within reasonably well -- defined controls . judging by the ' net this would n't work for hate crimes . some do n't believe in them , some believe only some groups can be victims , radically different views about where we can have ' implicit ' hate etc . it gets both arbitrary/unpredictable and dangerously close to policing political views - plenty of people 's view of what ' all reasonable people would think ' exclude the median voter for the other presidential candidate last time round for instance ( or here in the uk lots of people live in a social group where everyone voted remain despite the fact more in the country voted leave ) is it that you are arguing that making hate speech deformation , you can then ban certain kinds of speech in all forms ? when words are policed , those who do the policing have the control of which words are wrong and which are right ? you would deem hate speech , but what i 'd a black person said "" i hate white people "" should the government treat that the same way ? "" i believe that gender dysphoria is a legitimate mental illness , and using alternative pronouns are a way of normalizing a legitimate condition that should be researched for a cure . i therefore , refuse to use your preferred pronoun , not as an act of hate but a difference in opinion "" . regardless of the legitimacy of the above statement , this person is using a non-hateful rhetoric in what is now considered a hate crime to not use preferred pronouns . hate crimes that are backed with obvious intent and context are easy to spot : these are n't . to a transgender person , this may seem like a dehumanization on their own existence and feel as though their real and raw emotions are reduced down to a mental illness . thus , here is the question : how can ideas , which are fluid in nature be divided into "" hate speech "" , when the interpretation is everything ? defamation is speech that knowingly spreads False information about someone and causes measurable financial damage . furthermore , defamation is a civil matter , not a criminal one and only results in a financial settlement . inciting violence is another matter altogether and has nothing to do with defamation . hate speech generally does not target a single person and so can not cause measurable financial damage . additionally , hate speech is derived from stereotypes , which may or may not be True for a given individual , and may be based on True experiences . so , hate speech based on this negative saiyan stereotype does n't qualify as defamation under either category . i do n't support the laws against hate speech aimed at groups , but motivation should increase the punishments if a crime is comitted , including harassments . a lot of the discussion here hinges on the definition of hate speech , and i think your definition is too broad . consider how the supreme court of canada has defined it , in the context of canada 's laws against hate speech : "" likely to increase harm against a group of people "" is a very very low bar for hate speech , and i 'm not surprised there is lots of resistance . but note that even most people who argue against hate speech laws make exceptions for things like "" calls to violence "" . hate speech , like arguing for the idea "" white people are animals , they do n't deserve to exist and we should eliminate them "" , and building a group in support of this notion - that 's what should be illegal . "" hate crimes "" are not generally considered primary offences , they are considered secondary offences . the distinction is that a primary offence is what you are arrested upon , and secondary offences are really qualifications and additions that clarify the specifics of what you did in committing that crime . as a basic example - for a traffic violation a primary offence is something that can get you pulled over like going over the speed limit or ignoring a red light , a secondary offence is something you can be given a citation for but only after being pulled over such as failing to wear a seatbelt . in the case of violent crimes , "" hate crime "" is considered a secondary offence because it qualifies the intent of the crime and reflects the impact that the offence can have on protected and at risk groups - such as sexual and racial minorities . the primary offence would be the violent act - murder , assault , etc. . the secondary offence would be "" hate crime "" if the prosecution can prove that the assailant had a history of bigotry which demonstrated premeditation to inflict harm on a whole community . hanging a black man was n't just about murdering one person , it was about putting down the whole community to "" keep them in line "" , and so the qualification of a "" hate crime "" which adds to the punishment the prosecution can seek is there as a further deterrent to let society know that we will not tolerate violent oppression . hate speech is a tricky thing - i think you may be able to find a way to qualify it as a secondary offence , and there are limits even in the united states to how far our freedom of speech goes before speech is not protected - however i think your definitions could be overly broad and would not stand up to the tests we have gotten through case law via the scotus in regards to protected and unprotected speech . further - you 're claiming here that "" defamation "" would be the basis of creating laws to ban certain kinds of speech , and that 's not really how this works . libel and slander suits are civil suits , not criminal suits . this means a plaintiff is not pushing charges which could land someone in prison for their actions , but they are seeking restitution for damages against themselves . the bar , therefore , is much lower for a civil suit as all you have to prove is that you have been harmed by the actions taken in a tangible way . that includes black lives matter protesters saying "" cops kill black people "" , and political activists saying their opponent 's supporters are "" deplorables "" , and anybody being called a racist . the problem with using the same framework for hate speech is that dehumanizing statements are not necessarily False and can be statements of opinion not fact , and proving tangible damages is pretty much impossible . with hate speech there is no singular defendant , the defamed would be an entire religion/ethnicity/etc , and you would have to prove the hate speech cause damage to that class of people , which is going to be very hard to argue in my opinion . most people ignore individuals who espouse hate speech , and they do n't take their words with much weight . people accused of defamation or hate speech are routinely targeted by mobs . hate speech as a concept is completly subjective which is one of the main reasons why there should be no laws against it . let public opinion be the sole defence against "" hate speech "" . laws against hate speech would limit the flow if free ideas that everyone should have the right to . the key of what makes defamation defamation is that youre Falsely attacking their reputation . if you just say i hate joe even if that makes people more likely to hurt him , whatever , youre allowed to use your own mouth to express an opinion about him . broadening the definition of "" defamation "" to include negative statements made about groups would become , thought selective enforcement , a totalitarian 's dream . imagine how , for example , the church of scientology would use such a law to drag all its critics into court . that 's why most countries that have "" hate crime "" laws define them very narrowly . it 's temping to say "" just let the juries sort it out "" , but even if you are in the right , going to court is an expensive and time-consuming process . what that means in practice is that the side with the most money would be able to use the law to silence their critics ."
9rx7h9,"victim blaming can be legitimate to a partial degree i was talking to someone earlier this week about the solution ( s ) to bullying in school , particularly verbal bullying . as someone who went through a great deal of verbal bullying when i was younger ( but eventually overcame it ) , i expressed my view that the real , most effective solution to verbal bullying is simply for the person being bullied to stop caring about what the bully is saying and to take it less seriously . of course this is easier said than done , but ultimately it works . i was met with a very stern "" do n't blame the victim now ! "" . this got me thinking that simply saying this every time someone proposes a precaution a victim could take to lessen their chances of being attacked is very counterproductive and illogical . for example , in the case of home burglaries : nobody is saying that burglars should not be jailed and punished , but if someone 's house were to get robbed and they had left their door open and have taken no precautions , it would be mere common sense to advise them to install a lock and a security system on their home to keep their belongings safe . nobody cries "" victim blaming "" in this situation ( probably because burglary is nowhere near as touchy of a subject as something like bullying , or in the extreme case , rape ) . i believe there are two separate sorts of responsibility that people conflate to a great degree : a moral responsibility and a practical responsibility . the moral responsibility is about who is in the right or the wrong , more of a "" good vs. evil "" type of comparison , in which the victim is almost always in the right , and the perpetrator is almost always in the wrong . however , when people advise homeowners to install locks , they are not saying the homeowner is in the moral wrong . nobody is saying that the thief should n't go to jail since no lock was installed . what they are saying is that the victim has a practical responsibility to install the lock , not necessarily because they should morally have to do so in a perfect world , but simply because it is in their best interests and is the most effective solution to their problem . for example : if i had a 15 year old son , and he decided to venture in the dead of night outside of the house and nearly got captured by a kidnapper but barely made it out , upon returning home , i would do two things . first of all , i would take care of the moral end of things . i would call the authorities and inform them that a kidnapper was spotted nearby and attempted to kidnap my son . of course , i would be a stupid parent if i did not take care of the practical end of things and calmly inform my son that it is not smart for him to exit the house alone at that time of the night . in my mind , there is nothing wrong with that and it would be beyond foolish for someone to cry out that it is victim blaming . i understand that placing a high amount of stress on victims of traumatizing events by blaming them — even in a well-intentioned way — can be harmful to them mentally and may discourage other victims from coming forward for fear of such response . i also understand that it is a more constructive attitude to be supportive to victims after such events , however it is ultimately counterproductive and simply wrong to assume that any sort of advice given to the victim or questioning of their lack of precautions ( practical responsibility ) is a heinous act of victim blaming that ought to be eradicated . practical responsibility is not a matter of should or should n't , right or wrong ( which moral responsibility is ) — rather , it is a matter of could or could n't ; careful or foolish .","one problem is that while theoretically there 's a difference between practical and moral responsibility , practically there is a historical precedent for the two being dangerously conflated . the prototypical example of victim blaming comes from rape cases where there used to be cases where a man would rape a woman , be brought before the court , give the defense "" look at what she was wearing , she was asking for it "" and be found not guilty . there are still cases like this btw but far fewer than their were and "" do n't blame the victim "" is one of the rallying cries the brought those numbers now . additionally , many people engage in victim blaming for the purpose of reassuring themselves , often without realizing it . there 's a pattern of thinking humans engage in on subconscious level when presented with evidence that terrible things could happen to you at random called the just world fallacy . that means something terrible could happen to me and that is terrifying and an affront to the concept of self determination and free will ... but if i can figure a reason why that thing happened to them i can avoid doing that thing and be safe "" . the problem is that we do it regardless of whether or not there 's a practical reason or regardless of if that practical reason is really very good , and if there is n't a practical reason we 'll pull out a moral one . and we overemphasize the degree to which that factor was the cause of the tragedy . this is especially problematic in incidents with two people because it makes us subconsciously downplay the degree to which the bully/rapist/mugger / jerk was responsible for what happened whether we mean to or not . the point is that even when just world fallacy comes up with good advice , it 's still a bad system because it 's fundamentally a coping device that we use to distort our perception of reality to make ourselves comfortable and distance ourselves from the victim . the problem is that we have put too much blame on victims . court cases have brought out the victim 's clothing and sexual history as evidence she was so slutty every man has a standing invitation . similarly , there have been court cases trotting out whether black hoodies are a sign of being a thug . you 're right , people do n't hear "" lock your door "" "" hide your valuables "" as blaming the victim the same way they hear "" women should hold their keys "" "" do n't wear short skirts "" , or even "" do n't look white people in the eye "" that 's because of the history and the fact the first two pieces of advice apply to everyone , but the second group , only to some . how would you react , when i punch you in the stomach , to the advice that you need to just do sit-ups to have more muscle in your abs and that will make it hurt less ? would you say “ that ’s some great advice , i really should change myself to lessen the harm of your harmful acts ” ? because that situation changes the extent to which the burglary can occur , not the extent of harm the burglary causes . what you ’re describing ( change yourself so that the harm is lessened ) would be like telling a homeowner “ well if you did n’t have a television they could n’t have stolen it , and would n’t have wanted to break in . ” even excluding that you ’re blaming the victim for being too appealing a target , it ’s useless advice . again , you ’re comparing advice about how to make it less possible for the aggressor to do something to you to advice to make yourself a less appealing target . the good advice to your son is not to put himself in a position where it would be easier to attack him . the bad advice would be to tell your son to be less cute because someone would more want to kidnap him . i think victim blaming has a problem in that it detracts from the problems and focuses on the victim . in literally every situation , you can always find the solution through the victim . it is just as counterproductive in most cases to seek answers in the victim rather than the original causes itself . i do think that the term "" victim blaming "" gets over-extended in some situations . if you were in a theoretical discussion about bullying and talking about ways that you learned to manage it , i do n't believe that 's victim-blaming . we also need to consider the consequence of focusing on a person 's practical responsibility in the aftermath of an attack . there 's a concept called an ideal victim which we see a lot in national stories . anyone who gets killed or makes an accusation often has their character put under a microscope . further , practical responsibility will only take us as a society so far . if i follow all the advice that was ever given to me , and i never get drunk at a party and i never walk home alone at night and yadda yadda , i may manage to avoid being victimized . but in reality that just means that some other person will be in my place . victim blaming only works when you 're killed and eaten by an apex predator in its environment , such as grizzlies or sharks . a victim of crime has a reasonable expectation of safety around other people . i think there 's a difference between victim blaming and empowering a victim to change . when you victim blame , you make the victim seem like they had more responsibility than the perp and invalidate their pain by effectively saying "" well , what else did you expect ? "" what you describe up front actually sounds much more like the latter . but victim blaming , as i describe above , is what i think most people object to ; not too a realistic and empathetic examination of how to change going forward ."
9rx5wc,"killing an innocent life is wrong i just got into a small debate on another subreddit about whether or not taking an innocent life is wrong . it stemmed from a pro-life statement i made . this cmv post is not about abortion . it is purely about whether or not is is wrong to kill an innocent person . i have always believed that it is just plain wrong . that is an innocent life and you do n't have the right to kill that person . i do n't really understand how people could disagree with this . obviously there is the greater good and all that , but i mean just honestly walking up to a person and killing them . i do n't understand how it could ever be rationalized to be okay . self defense , saving other lives , etc okay fair . but just killing for no reason ? how ? please try to cmv . thanks .","say a 12 year old that is terminal ( with death being in the foreseeable future ) and suffering from inhumane levels of pain and begging to be euthanised . if killing an innocent life positively affects more people than it negatively affects then i do n't see it as wrong . if i had to the power to go back in time and kill hitler as an innocent baby , is that morally wrong in your opinion . technically speaking that life is innocent and i would be killing the life . a madman has his finger on the trigger of a nuclear device that will blow up a city if you do n't shoot an innocent child in the face ( and the child would n't be blown up if the device is triggered ) . of course , everyone would agree that killing someone for no good reason is wrong , almost by definition . you seem to qualify the morality of an action by it 's nature : depending on what you do , it 's either good or bad . but a lot of people , and it seems most of them liberals , are consequentialists . they judge the morality of an action not based on the nature of the action , but on its consequences . whatever you do , if the net result is more good than bad , then that action was good , whatever that action is . that 's why a consequentialist will not usually issue a blanket statement that action x is good or bad on its face , because it will depend on the situation , and specifically its consequences . you 're saying , "" it is wrong to kill an innocent life , "" and you are defining an innocent life as , "" a life which it is wrong to kill . "" why do you presuppose that there is in fact a greater good and a universal moral set that says it is wrong ? yes , it is wrong to arbitrarily kill someone ( guilty or innocent ) . i 'm aware that the following is a rather extreme point of view which probably conflicts with many religious views , but i think it 's worth considering nonetheless . furthermore , it should be said that in the following , killing refers to killing with a "" good reason "" exclusively . ( i could n't come up with a better term , what i basically mean is that i do n't support killing for entertainment etc. ) i think it is irrational to simply claim that a human may not be killed contrary to virtually every other form of life without giving a reason what differentiates humans from other beings . so think about what makes a human life worth protecting compared to other life forms . for me , the only thing that makes a human life special and worth protecting is the human 's ability to have goals and to plan ahead to achieve these goals - as there really is n't much else that differentiates us from other life forms . another reason that i think makes a life worth protecting is if killing it causes another being harm . if a mother decides to have an abortion ( no matter what reasons she has for it ) , it 's her decision and i do n't see a reason why she should be denied one . furthermore , if a mother wants an abortion , odds are she has good reasons for it and if she 's denied an abortion the child perhaps wo n't have a good childhood due to those reasons . the same argument can be used to defend euthanasia . however , this argument has some implications that are quite extreme as it can be used to defend killing mentally disabled people or a young child even after it has been born as long as they do n't have family members / friends who would suffer from their death . so if the influential concensus is that it is right to kill the innocent , then so it is . one time you are speaking of an innocent life , but then again you 're talking about an innocent person , those are two different things . you can define "" life "" as literally everything living in some way , even the weed in your garden or the mosquito annoying you in your bedroom . i guess it 's easy to find examples where killing such life would be considered at least amoral from the majority of the population ."
9rwrwj,"ideology limits one 's thinking and enforces biases and discourages healthy debate from my observations , i feel that ideology ( mainly in the political sense ) serves as a limit placed on one 's thinking ; a lens which tends to lock one 's thinking into a particular groove , which often leads to group-think tendencies and being dismissive of anything said to be counter to the ideas set forth or instilled . ideology discourages free and unfiltered critical thinking , where concepts are evaluated for what they are , on their own merits , and free of bias . ideology is the number one source for divisiveness when differing ideologies inevitably clash . one can not be free thinking if one heavily subscribes to one main ideology .","if you are aware of your prejudices and your biases , then you 're able to think more clearly about them . if you have stated aims , then you 're able to suggest that there are ways of reaching them . you can lie about it , though , and you will be unable to admit that you 're actually considering everything with the bias you claim not to have . i think the issue with your statement is that it is impossible to come to conclusions without ideology . so , in order to debate your view , could you please provide a concrete definition of ideology and an example of how one would go about determining the merits of an idea without an ideology ? a ideology is defined as "" a system of ideas and ideals , especially one that forms the basis of economic or political theory and policy "" , so in that sense anything you think of or any structure you follow is an ideology . people without too much political knowledge love to think that they are "" free "" from ideology and that every opinion they hold was reached through common sense and every other side either ignores either human nature or is cruel . partisan ideology dominates political discourse to the point that people ignore and twist facts to conform to their existing worldviews . but your ideology does n't have to be rigid -- it can ( and should ) mold and change over time as we grow and learn more about the world . the fact that you value unity over division in your post is itself an aspect of your personal political ideology . thoughts ca n't occur in a vacuum , they can always be traced back and referenced to those who hold similar values and beliefs . in fact , it can be far more detrimental to the free exchange of ideas when someone claims to be taking a "" neutral "" or "" non-ideological "" position , because they end up framing their own personal ideology and unconscious biases/influences as objective fact , while at the same time painting anyone who disagrees as misguided , blind , unthinking etc . ideology is not a rigid worldview , ideology is a lens which you view the world with . for example lets look at germany in the 1930s , during that time , all over europe , there were many jewish people in the profession of finance due to discrimination against jews in other fields . this however is only an observation of fact and does not say anything about what these facts mean and what we should or should n't do about it . nazism and fascism would say the only aryan people should be tolerated and jewish people are in finance to manipulate us . liberalism would say that who you are is not relevant at all and that this fact is a non issue that can be ignored . socialism would say that the finance industry as a whole is not a legitimate one , does not produce any valuable work , and we should scrap the entire industry . none of these ideologies were blind to facts , none of them tried to claim that jewish people were not common in the finance industry . plato 's form ( idea ) theory , unlike the english word "" idea "" , the idea here is closer to ideal . there is a divine ideal for beauty , and the closer you reach that ideal , the more beautiful you actually are . same goes for government , people hold an ideal society and strive to accomplish it . so when you study this ideal , you learn how to solve your problems and get one step closer . now to actually try and change your view about ideologies ... note that all those people , doesnt mean left or right , have some idea of a perfect world they strive for . so if you look at a problem you are facing , you can study how an ideal government would have fixed it . there is merit in striving for ideals , but the problem is , there are many dumb people ... they are sold the idea of an ideal , and then they are manipulated by smart people in power ( and i think both left and right leaders are just as guilty ) without an ideology , you ca n't determine if something is good or bad . people simply have different values , which is why they have different ideologies . still yet others value freedom highly over security , to the point that they would prefer it if there were no government . preferences like these generally lead people towards certain political ideologies . it 's not that i do n't recognize the merits of big government , it 's just that i prefer the set of pros and cons that comes with not having one . believing all political ideology is inherently flawed , creates and enforced biases , and discourages debate ... creates and enforces a bias in the mind of those who choose to follow that belief , and discourages debate . i think ideology is the idea for your entire way of thinking , distilled into an easy to understand concept ."
9rvuvb,"firearms should be required by law to be locked when being stored or not in use . i believe that states should require gun owners to lock their firearms when they are not being used ( often referred to as safe storage laws ) . locking can include trigger locks , barrel guards , lock boxes/safes , etc . to me , keeping guns locked seems like the responsible action to take as a gun owner . for example , evidence provided in 2016 showed that in pittsburgh alone 79 % of crimes involving firearms were committed by someone who did not own the weapon . there is plenty of global evidence that supports safe storage laws including suicide by firearm rate reduction . this is for a psychology assignment so i am open to all opinions . i only ask that the conversations remain civil .","it 's pretty hard to open a combination lock or fiddle with keys in the dark with a potential murderer mere feet away . if i was away from home , the first thing a criminal would steal would be a small safe . in order to get a truly effective safe , you need to pay about $ 3,000 and they weigh about half a ton . that 's not feasible for many people , a basic handgun like a glock costs around $ 500 or less . the storage issue is n't quibbling , most small gun safes or trigger locks are n't intended to keep guns from being stolen . anything smaller than a large expensive safe can usually be stolen as easily as one would steal a tv , or broken into with a crowbar on the spot . if someone is going to break into my home , they will have to use tools or techniques that translate into safe cracking skills , or just steal smaller safes and break into them later . parents who have guns should store them safely and educate their kids in the safe handling of firearms . but if someone breaks one set of locks to get into my home , another set of locks is very unlikely to stop them from stealing my guns . but i should not be required by law to engage in a security arms race with criminals . so this legal requirement would make me a criminal without improving anyone 's safety in any meaningful way . police are not allowed to invade your home to check if you have a lock on your gun , nor should they be . of those 79 % of gun crimes committed by people who did not own the firearm , can you answer what percentage of those firearms were actually stolen due to insufficient storage ? if you ca n’t , then i would say you are overlooking the possibility that many firearm owners are not taking proper steps to have the firearm re-registered to a new owner during a private sale . implementing unenforceable storage laws is not going to change that , and is the wrong battle . yea , but many people carry a gun to protect their homes incase of a break in . most people do n't own guns to keep them stored for days . if you own a firearm , you will probably claim your "" in-use "" time is the entire day because you need to be ready for anything . so here is a question , who is responsible for providing the gun lock . theoretically this could impose a financial burden and therefore infringe on ones right to bear arms . in a case like washington states i1639 , a safe storage law negatively affects the poor . ( there are many other problems with 1639 , such as safe storage is not defined yet failure to comply can be met with a felony ) the important statistic is the general suicide rate , which actually continues to increase regardless of firearm storage laws . in other words , you are taking people guns away , so they kill themselves with noose and poison instead ( source : -- url -- ) "" that the people have a right to bear arms in defense which explicitly says that requiring safe storage of firearms directly contradicts the right of people to defend themselves , which is the entire point of the 2nd . - other rights have restrictions , but only when they are demonstrated to be dangerous , not merely by potentially being dangerous . because your rights do not get stripped from you due merely to the existence of possible moral failure . adam lanza ( sandy hook mass shooter ) was rejected by the background check so he went for his parent 's guns in their safe . since criminals ( including gun smugglers from other countries ) do n't follow the law , do n't expect them to ever disarm . if gun bans worked , places like chicago and dc would be paradises . if you want to really know where criminals get their guns from , look no further then your local police station and feds . the numbers of shootings and gun-related crimes and number of stolen guns do n't add up . not everything that is a good idea should be required by law . yelling at a person who had gun stolen from their residence is some fantastic victim blaming . prescription drugs ? those can be sold to make money to commit crimes . we already have locks on the doors and in some places windows . it 's not the gun owners responsibility to stop crime . gun locks are to defeat small kids who do not have access to things to open the lock ."
9rudo3,"legalization is the wrong solution to our drug/alcohol abuse problem . history has valuable lessons to teach policy makers but it reveals its lessons only grudgingly . close analyses of the facts and their relevance is required lest policy makers fall victim to the persuasive power of False analogies and are misled into imprudent judgments . just such a danger is posed by those who casually invoke the '' lessons of prohibition '' to argue for the legalization of drugs . what everyone '' knows '' about prohibition is that it was a failure . it did not eliminate drinking ; it did create a black market . that in turn spawned criminal syndicates and random violence . corruption and widespread disrespect for law were incubated and , most tellingly , prohibition was repealed only 14 years after it was enshrined in the constitution . the lesson drawn by commentators is that it is fruitless to allow moralists to use criminal law to control intoxicating substances . many now say it is equally unwise to rely on the law to solve the nation 's drug problem . but the conventional view of prohibition is not supported by the facts . first , the regime created in 1919 by the 18th amendment and the volstead act , which charged the treasury department with enforcement of the new restrictions , was far from all-embracing . the amendment prohibited the commercial manufacture and distribution of alcoholic beverages ; it did not prohibit use , nor production for one 's own consumption . moreover , the provisions did not take effect until a year after passage - plenty of time for people to stockpile supplies . second , alcohol consumption declined dramatically during prohibition . cirrhosis death rates for men were 29.5 per 100,000 in 1911 and 10.7 in 1929 . admissions to state mental hospitals for alcoholic psychosis declined from 10.1 per 100,000 in 1919 to 4.7 in 1928 . arrests for public drunkennness and disorderly conduct declined 50 percent between 1916 and 1922 . for the population as a whole , the best estimates are that consumption of alcohol declined by 30 percent to 50 percent . third , violent crime did not increase dramatically during prohibition . homicide rates rose dramatically from 1900 to 1910 but remained roughly constant during prohibition 's 14 year rule . organized crime may have become more visible and lurid during prohibition , but it existed before and after . fourth , following the repeal of prohibition , alcohol consumption increased . today , alcohol is estimated to be the cause of more than 23,000 motor vehicle deaths and is implicated in more than half of the nation 's 20,000 homicides . in contrast , drugs have not yet been persuasively linked to highway fatalities and are believed to account for 10 percent to 20 percent of homicides . prohibition did not end alcohol use . what is remarkable , however , is that a relatively narrow political movement , relying on a relatively weak set of statutes , succeeded in reducing , by one-third , the consumption of a drug that had wide historical and popular sanction . this is not to say that society was wrong to repeal prohibition . a democratic society may decide that recreational drinking is worth the price in traffic fatalities and other consequences . but the common claim that laws backed by morally motivated political movements can not reduce drug use is wrong . not only are the facts of prohibition misunderstood , but the lessons are misapplied to the current situation . the u.s. is in the middle stages of a potentially widespread heroin epidemic . if the line is held now , we can prevent new users and increasing casualties . so this is exactly not the time to be considering a liberalization of our laws on heroin . we need a firm stand by society against heroin use to extend and reinforce the messages that are being learned through painful personal experience and testimony . the real lesson of prohibition is that the society can , indeed , make a dent in the consumption of drugs through laws . there is a price to be paid for such restrictions , of course . but for drugs such as heroin and other opioids , which are dangerous but currently largely unpopular , that price is small relative to the benefits .","there legalization of production and sales , and then there 's legalization of use . based on your comments , you seem to be against legalization of production and sales , fearing that it would lead to large scale production by a handful of big coproations . on the other hand , i do n't think use should be criminalized . if the users are functional productive members of society , there 's no reason to disrupt their lives . if the users have mental health issues that lead to excessive use , then they need help , not prison time . sending people to prison is expensive , and is only beneficial to society if they would cause more harm not removed . sending users that are otherwise productive members of society to prison is costly because 1 ) you 've reduced number of tax payers by one 2 ) you 've increase number of people dependent on the government for livelihood by one , and 3 ) you are potentially exposing someone to a life of more serious crimes . according to this graph sourced from the above page , it appears that the homicide rate ( the only consistent data available ) increased during prohibition and also shot up during the hight of the drug war . this chart from the nih indicates that we are currently below the rate of cirrhosis from the prohibition erra with our legal alcohol . the issue seems to have been worst during the hight of the drug war . it also does n't track evenly with the reported consumption rate since that data comes only from legal sales making it hard to get a clear picture of what was actually going on . the results seem to indicate that drug harms went down in their population rather than up . there is also less use of synthetic drugs which are even more dangerous . they have since seen lower drug use rates , lower continued drug use , and much lower drug induced death and new cases of aids among drug users generally speaking while you are right that prohibition did lower the number of users , it significantly changed the population that drank , for example women particular young women drank more . generally speaking when you criminalize an activity that involves drugs ( with alcohol being a drug ) you switch the demographic that uses it , with young people more likely to be associated with the product . since criminal records persist over the user 's life time , it lowering what the these classes of people can contribute to society . more over since a person can not receive treatment for drug addiction and sstill maintain gainful employment , it prevent people seeking treatment , or requires the state to pay for incarcerating them . therefore while prohibition does lowers the number of users , what it really does increase the damage to a select group of individuals , usually those that society deems less important . and since we live in a western society and ca n't just kill them for using drugs , it requires society to perform services for them , then them performing them for society . therefore the benefits are large , as long as you go in with the full understanding of cost of labeling drug users criminals , if you come in with the idea that a drug users should immediately receive no benefits from the state , and be immediately removed for it , then yes it is more effective . also , i am not sure whee you are getting that violent crime did not increase . there was an increase in homicide and drop off after repeal . you focus on how prohibition was misunderstood but theres no need when we have piles of direct evidence of legalization of drugs and the effect on crime , usage rates , overdose , everything . first off , you made a large number of claims , but have n’t sourced any of them . it 's hard to believe there was an objective source for saying alcohol prohibition cut drinking in half nationwide . that we 'd see 200 % of the usage rate if we legalized it , and that that would have effects at all comparable to doubling the drinking rate ?"
9rtr4h,"there is no difference between a man hitting a woman and vice-versa . > there are obvious gender differences ; men are stronger than women , and there are also social and behavioral differences . use of force is hard to judge . i agree with these arguments . i understand that size being correlated with gender means there are innate differences between men and women , and also the function of this rule in gender-based violence . but i retain my original view that men hitting women is no worse than vice-versa .","the way my dad taught me was , "" do n't start fights , and never hit anyone you are n't willing to kill . "" you had better feel genuinely threatened if you want to take the risk of killing a person . when it comes to hitting women , i think the main point is that most men can subdue or escape from most women , so men hitting women is generally wrong for the same reasons hitting a child , elderly person , or person in a wheelchair is wrong . the social disapproval for men who hit women is based on the same idea . most of the arguments you 're making are encoded in law and socials norms . i 'd push back on you trying to make this a simple black and white issue . in some ways it 's True that there is no difference between those situations ( but only in the most abstract terms , wherein we all have an equal interest in not being assaulted ) . in other ways it 's True that there are differences , based on statistical differences between men and women that are meaningful when talking about physical confrontation . men are , on average , a bit stronger and more aggressive than women . so the "" never hit a woman "" rule is a useful heuristic to minimize damage during emotional conflicts . this is not ( generally ) encoded in law , because it would violate a principle of legal equality , and because statistical differences are hard to take account of using categorical rules . therefore a social norm is the proper place for this rule , rather than criminal code . women are , on average , slightly more likely to hit their domestic partner than men are . we have laws that say hitting your partner is not permissable , regardless of who is doing the hitting . those laws do not make sex or gender distinctions , which are categorical and can therefore apply to everyone . i find it alarming that when many men here about gender equality , their first hope is "" so i can hit women now ? "" studies show women are equally likely to hit a man . the only way to end the charades where women abuse the system to punish the man , is to threaten child protective services if either act up . you 'll see couples start to communicate and work things out again like the good old days instead of taking the path of least resistance which is human nature . women by nature are rebellious and will do so even at the expense of the childrens ' well being and safety . also , the unconstitutional lautenberg amendment disarms families and leaves them vulnerable to armed criminals . not only this but criminal charges restricts employment and does not better the situation at home . both the man and the woman need to be charged with domestic violence along with child service intervention if either act up . women need to learn not to fight nature and just listen and submit to their men . men need to protect their ladies and honor them with loyalty . how about i convince you that there is no cultural norm that says men are obligated to "" take assault from a woman . "" it is n't ok for a woman to hit a man and i do n't think anyone says otherwise . but along the lines of your question , there is definitely a diference between a man hitting a woman and a woman hitting a man , just as there is a difference between hitting someone with a bat versus hitting them with your first . men hit harder than women , and thus cause more damage . if you had any interest in entertaining it , there are also obvious social and behavioral differences between men and women that change the context of the situation entirely . in order for what you say to be True , there would have to be no difference between men and women . there obviously are , so it is is obviously different when a woman hits a man vs when a man hits a woman . i agree that gender should not be the deciding factor in judging the morality of someone hitting someone else . but you are wrong to say there is no difference whatsoever . i would say that there is a major difference between someone weaker attacking a stronger person and someone stronger attacking a weaker person . the average man is a lot stronger than the average woman , so there is a difference . men and women do not have equal strength , so treating them equally in this regard is morally wrong . men are vastly , vastly stronger than women , and tend to injure them worse . \ > gender should not be taken into account in violence , save for exceptions . gender is also not the only factor that plays a role in assault by default , "" save for exceptions "" . one other factor that is threated the same as gender is experience in martial arts . i used to do karate as a teen and our teacher was very clear that even though we were no black belts at the time , in a similar safe defence case , where we were to be attacked , we would be partially be liable if we were to hit back . reason is that law enforcement can safely assume that we could have defended us or deescalated the situation otherwise by immobilizing them etc . basically hitting them back in the same manner as they did would be handled as if we attacked with a weapon instead . now of course there are exceptions here , as having some friendly martial arts lessons does n't automatically make everyone invincible and even black belts sometimes get beaten up by thugs . just as not every woman is automatically weaker than any man . but this is a guidance rule in the law enforcement in my country to safely assume that in most of the cases a martial arts practitioner had the possibility to defend themselves or deescalate the situation otherwise and just as they can also assume that in most of the cases a man had the power to defend themselves or immobilize a woman without using brute force . it is because this alternative possibilities than hitting back are assumed , why hitting back is considered as excessive force by default , again safe for exceptions . both legally as well as socially . i hope this other example helps showing why we certain factors like gender are taken into account for responses to violence . just think of age ( both young and very old ) , big size differences , able-bodiedness etc. where we have a similar stance that one party had by default the option to ensure their safety in a different way "" save for exceptions "" . i disagree with the notion of "" knocking someone out who hitted you is wrong "" . if someone literally jumps me , i 'm using all my strength to get out of the situation , not "" just enough so he/she is n't knocked out "" . men do not have anything like the history of oppression , domination , abuse , and sexual assault that women have with men . when a woman is violent with a man it is rarely that the man does n't know where this will end , that it is used to dominate and subjugate her , that he may beat her to death , or rape her . the reality is that women are much more vulnerable to men , in general , not in all cases . this context needs to be taken into account when men are violent with women , that the psychological impact and fear thus can cause are much more intense ."

9rrgxr,"there is nothing inherently racist or wrong with blackface and by that i do n't mean blackface ca n't be racist or wrong , they definitely can , but what you 're really doing is just putting black make up , and whether that action is right or wrong is entirely dependent on the context of why you 're doing it . i do n't think it 's fair to call something racist when there is zero intent of racism , to simply label every occurrence of blackface as racism is just toxic identity politics . megyn kelly was right to say that she does n't understand why it 's wrong for kids to wear blackface . she 's also right to defend luann de lesseps for her diana ross costume by tanning her skin to appear darker . all of these actions have zero elements of racism in it ; none of these actions were done with the idea of racism in mind , none of these actions result discrimination and oppression of other races , etc . to call someone a racist for an action that literally has zero to do with racism is already unjustified , to fire someone from their jobs for it is even worse .","when people show that they do n't understand why something is racist ... because they view it from a different ( less informed about history , perhaps ) perspective , we should explain to them how and why people feel differently , but we should n't call them racist if they do not intend to disparage another race - in fact , we should just be glad that such people exist . possible insensitivity to one person of a particular race may not be wrong if the person presenting the act does not know why it may be insensitive . if the person knows the history of the act and it 's insensitive nature , then it would be wrong if the person knows it 's highly likely that a large portion of people from a certain race may receive the act offensively . megyn kelly admitted she was wrong and that it was racist though . the context is that blackface was something that was used for centuries as a way for whites to make fun of blacks . for example , a group of non-black dancers decided to make a school performance with the theme of black panther . they performed and showcased black panther ( african culture ) beautifully through their dance and part of their costume is the black paint on their skin . there ’s a history behind black face that is very long and i ’m sure you know the history of it . there is nothing inherently racist about a set of two lines of equal length , bisecting at each of their mid-points , one perpendicular to the other , and then attaching four substantially smaller lines to each of the ends of each of the previous lines , attached at right angles , arranged in such a way so that the entire affair has rotational symmetry ."
9rqcrt,"voting should be compulsory in a democracy i do n't see any downside to forcing people to vote if you allow them to cast a blank vote . on the other hand , optional voting means that a candidate or a party , instead of trying to appeal to and represent a larger population , can instead simply prevent its opposition from voting . the idea that your vote does n't matter comes to mind , as people can simply not bother to go and vote . choosing inconvenient places to hold the ballots , quietly removing certain groups of people from the pool of eligible voters , choosing bad days that people can not afford to take off , and others are only some of the things i can see that could be exploited . all of that would be useless if every single person was expected by law to vote .","the downside of compulsory voting is that ironically it rescues the need to appeal to people who may not vote due to lack of enthusiasm for any party . at the moment someone unimpressed by political consensus has to be enthused and encouraged to vote . if everyone voted i suspect it would be easier for parties to ignore their ' base ' who do n't feel represented but are the other parties as even worse . voluntary voting means the desire to triangulate and appeal to floating ( centrist ) voters is balanced by needing to activate your base who may think you 're compromising too much . although some responsible people in this group would just cast a blank vote , the rest would n’t care about the morals of ignorantly voting . nobody should be forced to participate in the democracy , even if they just fill out a blank ballot . the idea of "" if they do n't want to vote then they can cast a blank ballot "" is pointless , because it is a waste of time and resources to force millions of people to go in , just to say "" hey i do n't want to vote "" . while it may be difficult for you to understand why someone would n't want to vote , you should understand that millions of people are like this and we need to respect their freedom of choice . problem is that compulsory voting deteriorates the quality of your intelectual discourse , and the politics . so as a result , they are preyed by countless biases and simple ( but very effective sounding to a layman ) rhetoric . they wo n't cast blank votes , they want truly best for the country , rather than to just trash the vote . it ’d be much more worthwhile to protest by not submitting a ballot at all , or worse yet using the ballot as a tool to undermine democracy by voting for someone whom you do n’t know anything about . if 90 % of people did n't vote that tells the leaders that change is required . if it is compulsory then it means that i will face punitive action from the state if i refuse ( such as being robbed by a fine or being thrown in cage against my will . ) therefore you are advocating for a system where people are forced to work against their will without pay and face punitive action if they refuse . you 're more likely to win the lottery than have your 1 vote change an outcome of an election . however , i think that australia has a decent system of charging people a small fine if they do n't vote ."

9rlnbi,"1984 by george orwell is not “ more relevant now than ever ” 1984 was written about two authoritarian governments of the time ( nazis and the ussr ) and how similar they are to each other . the society is obviously a mix of those two cultures and the spying on the populace is what orwell believed they would have done if they had the technology . in the modern world , we do have governments spying on their people , but without the looming threat of force that the ingsoc party uses . we can not say that the nsa looking at people through their webcams without anyone knowing is the same as people being afraid to do anything out of the ordinary or risk death or worse . organizations such as the spies are based off of the hitler youth and probably some organizations in the ussr , but there ’s nothing like that in modern society ( at least in western societies ) . there is major political discourse . we are super polarized between the left and right wing , in 1984 everyone was loyal to the party . except for thought criminals . people throw around phrases like thoughtcrime nowadays to defend themselves against others calling them homophobes , racists , sexists , and fascists . this is not the same concept as thoughtcrime as there is no threat of persecution from just speech so long as it does not directly incite violence , and even then , it ’s rare that people are actually held accountable for violence that they encouraged .","orwell actually said that though there were obvious similarities to those authoritarian governments that it is actually western democracies that use these kinds of tactics predominantly , because they are n't able to control their populations through direct force . orwell did n’t write 1984 with the intention that it would be read by people living in a society like ingsoc — if you can go through the book and say “ yeah , that ’s exactly how things are now ” then it ’s too late — you would n’t even be able to read 1984 in that sort of society , so the book would n’t be relevant . the book is relevant so long as it can help us from becoming a society like ingsoc , ao it definitely is still relevant . control of the population through control of the message is nothing new , but social media , hyperpartisan news outlets , targeted algorithms which mean we only ever get one perspective , and leaders like trump who are in power due to their ability to directly communicate with the voters without having to pass through filters which might apply fact checking and some ability to redress balance means that it is now much easier for one particular political discourse to dominate to the exclusion of all others . in the interrogation scene in 1984 this is the most appalling moment : before now we read it as a ludicrous indictment of the rejection of reality ( surely , we conclude , the party itself must know that 2 +2 = 4 ; science , machines all depend on it ) . orwell knew that authoritarian regimes want the heart and soul of people . instead of the elite of nineteen eighty-four , who keep big brother ’s identity a mystery while they keep total control , this big brother , with his direct twitter relationship with his followers , is fully on show . relevance is how applicable the concepts in the book are to life in a given country today . if we are currently dealing with the highest level of domestic espionage and an unchanged level of "" spies "" or authoritarianism in the government , then the book would be most relevant today . but a theory i have is that the vocabulary and themes of 1984 is too widespread in popular culture and even our colloquial language , and well-known even to people who have n't read it ( or read it a long time ago ) that it 's impossible for our society to ever become like ingsoc ; anytime anything happens that appears to push us in that direction , people are quick to call it out because of the "" trope "" of authoritarianism , so to speak , that orwell created that is so well known . books like brave new world or fahrenheit 451 , which are n't as part of pop culture as orwell 's is , is a different story . i feel like our society could take up elements of those societies without people really noticing because the hallmarks are n't as well known . doublethink is the idea that you can simultaneously hold multiple contradicting views at the same time , especially as a result of political indoctrination . it 's not that people are worried about it existing now , it 's that there are forces operating in our society seeking power within all institutions that holds power ( governments local , state , and federal , and corporations ) and want to develop a society that is eerily similar to say the least . progressives have been trying to implement hate crime laws , some even propagate "" misogyny "" as a hate crime - whatever that 's supposed to mean . a woman in the uk was arrested and charged for hate crime repeating "" ngger "" on instagram in a song dedicated to her friend who died in a tragic car accident . the orwellian bit is that speech is now considered a form of violence . so-called "" hate speech "" is seen and treated as a form of violence ."
9rk89i,"all classified govt material should be unclassified after 100 years i believe that transparency is a hugely important thing for the govt of a civil society . one of the things that protects bad actors is the ability to hide their misdeeds from the public . different justifications are used - most along the lines of "" national security "" . but i believe the knowledge that 50 or 75 years after their death , the legacy of officials might be marred by corrupt or illegal acts being revealed would cause more bad behavior to be avoided than "" good "" ( but necessary ? ) behavior might be discouraged . so i believe that all classified , confidential , top-secret , etc ( regardless of whatever of level of secrecy ) material should be declassified once it becomes 100 years old . most people i 've said this to tend to agree with me . there are only three arguments i 've heard that even try to argue against it : 1 . that the grandchildren of an award winning hero may be traumatized to learn that it was actually a cover and their ancestor actually died due to friendly fire , a procedural error , or some other less-than-honorable manner . 2 . that knowing that history would eventually see all their deeds would cause officials to make "" safe "" or "" nice "" or "" passive "" decisions when sometimes "" dangerous "" or "" mean "" or "" aggressive "" actions are absolutely necessary . 3 . that learning of some horrific act done 100 years ago by completely different people and a completely different govt would still inspire acts of violent retaliation by individuals or even state actors today . what will not change my mind : - 1 is entirely unconvincing to me . while i would feel sympathy for someone learning that a powerful motivating family narrative was a fabrication to cover something ... dirty ... i still think declassifying everything after 100 years is of much greater benefit to society than that cost . - examples of public officials choosing , due to contemporary public pressure , a "" passive "" decision rather than a "" aggressive "" decision resulting in negative consequences ways to change my mind : - demonstrate with historical examples how # 2 or # 3 has happened with significant negative consequence - provide me with a different , convincing argument - demonstrating negative consequences from exposure of 100 year old classified material - apart from those i 've listed above","while morally , witholding information is wrong , some secrets are better kept due to the negative impact they might have on society . to demonstrate this i 'm gon na use an example , keep in mind that this is not an opinion of mine but just a what-if scenario . imagine if someone found objective proof of black people being inferior . after an extensive study on genetics , researchers come to the conclusion that black people are more agressive , less intelligent and all this is actually proven . i apologise for using such a weird and offensive example , but it just seemed like a very obvious way to show how information can cause serious problems . when you find out about the shady stuff the government has done in the past it will make you wonder what kind of shady stuff they 're doing right now . and the more shady stuff you hear about the more you start wondering . well , not so much , but i am a software contractor to a western government with some clearance to view some classified information . many countries including the one i currently work for have similar rules to what you describe , and every country in aware of also had discretion to ignore it if x important person says so and y important lesson agrees . the majority of classified information , i 'd say , is basically useless to anyone after ten years , and nearly all is useless after 25 , but that 's not to say that some is n't still sensitive after 100 . if you take the example of a particular operation , then sure , that 's basically declassifiable a few years after the operation , so your argument holds . some things though , are still in operation after 100 years or more , and so still sensitive . the best example i know of is plans to buildings , which in many cases are still very similar years later , and remain sensitive until the building is completely changed , or abandoned . a made up example for instance could be the sewers under something like the pentagon , which should remain classified while the building remains operational . sues like that are often over 100 years old , especially in countries less recently built than america . buckingham palace in london for example is hundreds of years old , and a prime target , with plenty of old structures that should be secret . ~ ~ largely ~ ~ partly because i feel like certain things would just end up in the shredder before the hundred year mark . giving people an immovable , without exception , point where things become public could definitely lead to certain clandestine agencies being outed . especially , for example , if they were to declassify the requests for beginning certain programs . i think we should n't keep anything but the most important stuff that pertains to national security , as well as the security of our actively deployed military brigades and executive officials . many of us have always suspected that the us 's involvement in iraq and afghanistan was more for the purpose of spreading terror instead of inhibiting it ( given the rate of civilian casualties ) but it was never really public knowledge , or part of the debate on the mass scale , until bradley manning ( presently known as chelsea manning ) leaked videos of our military firing upon a school . reagan made gps available to the public shortly after a korean airlines flight was shot down when it unknowingly entered soviet airspace on the condition that the signal be scrambled in such a way that it was only accurate to within 300 meters iirc , which rendered it 's usefulness more or less to airlines . thickness of the armor on the tanks we 're using , as well as the security technology used within the vc-25s ( often called "" air force one "" but this is just the callsign used by any air force craft the president is on board ) that potus can use at a moment 's notice . and the designs of our primitive nuclear weapons , however simplistic of a construction they are . many weapons systems also pertain to national security , including weapon guidance and long-range technologies . i have a secret clearance and have been over these trainings 100000s of times . you still need to get a justification and to have some kind of historian diploma but basically if you are determined enough you can get access to the entirety of the military archives let 's say for example the war in irak , it 's still ongoing and might for a few more decades , so revealing those classified document might/will incriminate people still alive and/or part of the current government . the modern us classification system labels information as secret or top secret based on these definitions : exceptionally grave damage to the national security that the original classification authority is able to identify or describe . as others have stated , these secrets already have expiration dates that automatically declassify secrets unless waivers/requests to extend them are placed . if you read the definitions closely , these secrets do not take a stance on whether actions are corrupt or illegal , but instead are focused on the implications to the country . let 's take an example : ever since we 've had nuclear weapons , we 've identified targets in the soviet union/russia we would nuke in the event of a nuclear exchange . yes , absolutely : because to reveal it would allow the russians to beef up defenses in those areas , move their targets into hiding , find routes to intercept our bombers , etc . something mundane like "" the russian foreign minister likes three cubes of sugar with his tea "" would be classified top secret . but it is top secret because the knowledge of that would lead russian counterintelligence to know that someone close to him is giving information to the americans . 100 years from now , that might not be relevant as the source might be dead . however , said source 's family may still be working for us . said source 's family may be targeted/attacked if that information was leaked or declassified . and , the russians would now know that perhaps years or even decades of more material was leaked . focus on classified cures to cancer and aids , over 3000 free energy inventions confiscated by intelligence agencies , longevity and immortality findings and even age-reversing technology . following your proposal we 'd now have open access to anything prior to 1918 . now , i 'm not an expert to what extent those things are already publicly available but this would mean that people had - without restriction - ability to look at production methods and - arguably more importantly - 1st hand studies ( by the involved militaries ) on the effectiveness of chemical weapons in world war 1 and presumably guides how to use them most effectively . in 21 years the complete declassification of materials from the manhattan project would start . so in ~ 25 years we 'd get the full declassification of things like the design of high-explosive lenses for nukes and the trigger mechanisms used . in around 30 years we get full designs of thermonuclear weapons and miniaturization processes for them , regular nukes as well as more efficient enrichment methods . thats still a bit further away but eventually as materials in regards to how countries like south africa or israel were able to acquire nuclear in secret and with limited economic means would become de-classified . yes , these things are edge cases of what governments have data on but if you make an absolute case they become relevant in that such data could inadvertently provide bad actors ( primarily autocratic regimes i 'd say ) with instructions how to maximize their destructive abilities . i think if the sources , means , methods or ramifications of a specific action or analysis are still in use or would still have a detrimental impact , then why would we do that ? a bit of an extreme case is nuclear weapons design . i 'm not the most well-versed person when it comes to cyber security , but you have to think about the nsa and everything they 've got classified . information about you and i from our google searches to our most private conversations . sure , 100 years later we 'll be dead , but the ethics are very fuzzy to me . a long term strategy is important , and sometimes a grand design wo n't become obvious until a century or two down the road . i think the biggest problem with your argument is the time span , i think 75 years , or when all involved are deceased , whichever happens first . ideally 100 % clarity constantly , but we are n’t in a world where that works . with regards to old classified operations/intelligence/ect , that 's more or less the main reason anything stays classified that long in real life . consider that we now have most of the records from stuff like the manhattan project , the d-day landings , and we even know a fair bit about most classified cold war military hardware except for the stuff still in use . the reason that "" human intelligence "" tends to stay classified for absurdly long periods of time is literally because it can cause violent retaliation . you say "" different people , different government "" but imprisoning or "" disappearing "" the grandkids of someone who did something is a pretty scary thing and could serve as an effective deterrent for someone thinking of turning now . consider that the us has had continuity of government for over 200 years , britain has for arguably anywhere between ~ 200 and 500 , and most of the major players both in europe and in the world generally have had the same system of government for at least 70 years or more . there are a lot of reasons for those harsh actions , but a lot of it comes down to discouraging future actions by similar people . on top of that , even if you assume that there 's no retaliation and no risk to anyone still living a current government often wo n't want the embarrassment or distraction of having to apologize for something 100 years old . okay , but none of that is anywhere near 100 years old . right ? well , consider these examples , which are the closest i can find to 100 year old secrets ( remember , most of this stuff either comes out well before then or never gets revealed ) : kim philby 's legacy is still causing fallout for his granddaughter in the uk even 25 years after he 's dead and over 80 years after he started spying for the ussr . the nanking massacre is still a hot button issue for china and japan 81 years later and still having a significant impact on their relations . lastly i 'd like to point out that the history of modern espionage actually only goes back to ww1 , so if you 're hoping for some actual 100 year old examples in that vein your desire is unrealistic . there is very little classified material that old that is unknown to the public and still exists as any kind of record , thanks to age , loss , wars , ect and almost no spying efforts since spying in ww1 was quite limited and again we 're fairly sure we know everything there is to know there . the world now is fundamentally different from what it was 100 years ago , and it would be , at least in my opinion , extremely foolish to make any kind of hard rule about the declassification of information in a time period we know nothing about and , realistically speaking , about information we know nothing about . all government material should be unclassified and open to the public . the vast majority of everything is given a declassification date 25 or 50 years from the date of classification . occasionally there are dates appended with an x , which means they may be reviewed to extend beyond that date . all agencies with classification authority can use both of these , with the exception of the department of justice ( excluding the fbi ) , the bureau of engraving and printing , the missile defense agency , and nasa which are only authorized to use 25x . in order to be granted an exception to declassification , a reason has to be provided , and there are only a handful of justifications that can be used . for 25x , the numbers are 1-9 , and the reasons can be found here . you have n't talked to them in 25 years , but they 're still alive and living in the country that they stole from . then their information is declassified . with 25x , this extension can only be made once , and only for 25 years . so therefore , the vast majority of information will not be classified beyond 50 years . these are \ not \ automatically declassified until 75 years . but they can be reviewed for declassification at 50 years , and an agency can apply for an extension beyond that 75 years . just a note on some of the views you shared in your comments : over-classification is just as illegal as under-classification and can be met with the same fines and prison time , and only a handful of people have classification authority anyway ; most people use derivative classification authority and have to specifically note what classification authority the information falls under . classifying anything simply to cover up corruption , mistakes , or other wrongdoing is strictly illegal . sure it does happen , but when it 's ultimately found , that 's just more charges piling up . classification can only be used to prevent the release of information that would cause "" damage "" ( confidential ) , "" serious damage "" ( secret ) , or "" grave damage "" ( top secret ) to the united states . tl ; dr very few things remain classified that long , and if they do they have a specific reason that has been reviewed and approved . sure , technically the information on ho nukes work is already published , but the specific instructions and designs are n't . with it , any country or individual could simply and easily construct a nuclear bomb as soon as they had all the materials , which are n't excessively hard to come by on a black market . also , thresholds like this are n't enormously effective because of the sheer volume of classified material . ways of making weapons , highly specialized technology that provides tactical advantage , information we 've uncovered that , if it fell into the wrong hands , would mean our extinction . surely the details about alien contact should remain classified by the government . technical documents on how to make nuclear/other wmd should never be declassified you 're saying that 25 years later there should be no exceptions whatsoever , even regarding foreign intelligence that could potentially unmask , or make it easier to unmask current agents abroad ? in 20 years i can have an instruction manual on how to build an atom bomb . what if the tensions still exist after 100 years , like in a war lasting more than a century . england and france did have a war that actually lasted a century . in this case , revealing information to the public would also be revealing it to the people who are in a war against you , leaving that country to possibly lose the war . surely if anything needed to not get out there , it would just be written in even the slightest ambiguity or code so that it is perfectly understood at the time but 100 years later there is obvious deniability and nobody would be alive to confirm or deny it . do you expect the government to efficiently digitize and catalog all of this stuff online in a searchable format for you ? or would it be a warehouse with bankers boxes full of old papers that were never intended to be preserved 100 years and are already faded or illegible for various reasons ? would every audio take and film reel the government produced be provided for people to handle , or would a government worker handle setting up the film reel when some person shuffled through everything and picked a vaguely named film ? what happens if a government employee wrote in a notebook an theory of how jfk died but his notebook was archived and eventually released and people started assuming the document was factual . if something has be top secret for so long it ’s not just to save face . we should n’t be releasing information that threatens the public or stability of a country . i will provide you with evidence that 100 year old classified information will soon be extremely destructive . the paper is a fascinating read about how they developed their program , both for nuclear , biological and chemical weapons ( they also tried crazy scifi stuff like beam or plasma weapons , whatever those are ; they failed at nuclear weapons completely for many unrelated reasons ) . in particular , it highlights what they failed at . they failed because they did n't have engineering knowledge , they only had vague but competent theoretical knowledge . for example , they knew the formula for sarin , but they did n't know the practical chemical engineering that goes into making sarin . yes , you can make a few grams of sarin in a lab , but learning the practical tricks of the trade about how to make tons of the stuff without killing yourself , that takes a huge amounts of time and it 's very dangerous . by about 1940 these techniques were well worked out and by 1950 they were a completely industrialized process . these details are very exacting : what is the composition of the vessels at different stages of the reaction , what temperature should things be hated to , what concentrations are ok , what can you measure to verify purity , etc . they 're very tiny details that add up to not being able to manufacture this stuff at scale easily . the report clearly makes the case that they had the funding and the ability to kill many tends of thousands . they just did n't have the howto guide about how to do the practical engineering . same story for biological weapons , they had a russian paper describing what should happen , but they did n't have all of the classified details about how these things should happen . engineering details come into play in all sorts of aspects of the operation . that 's why they showed up on trains with shopping bags . they did n't have access to all of the aerosol research the us and russia ( and others ) have done on sarin and how to get it into people at concentration to kill . they built a lot of clumsy distribution mechanisms ( one that almost burned the team alive in a van ) . had this been 30 years later , and had they had access to all of the 100 year old declassified engineering details , they would have killed an unfathomable number of people . i 'm of the opinion that classified information should be released much sooner than 100 years , and should be severely limited in scope to begin with . the government , and its agents are supposed to be acting on behalf of the citizens of their respective jurisdictions . we , as citizens , have a right to transparency , so that we can ensure that our elected and appointed officials are acting in good faith . classifying information is , in my opinion , almost always detrimental to the interest of the greater good . it is a way for government officials to cover for bad behavior . it also makes for situations in which there is a snowballing of classified information . one bit of classified info allows for classifying any new info that is related to the original info . more often than not , classified information is classified for the sake of the government and its officials . say 200 years ago the british government made a secret intelligence-sharing deal with the vatican , and that deal is still active and useful . you imply that state secrets must be declassified after 100 years to make sure the public knows about its governments unseemly behavior . us law already prohibits the use of classification to hide activity that is embarrassing , unethical , or illegal . i argue that the existing statue which directly addresses the abuse of classification to hide things from the public is a better standard than the 100 year tripwire . as u/grunt08 mentioned classified material is given a declassification date 25 to 50 years after its creation , a shorter window than you suggest . it also provides flexibility for the proper purpose of classification : the protection of information that if disclosed will cause demonstrable harm to the nation ’s interests . something becoming declassified does not mean it will be distributed or that its distribution will be public release . there is also for official use only stuff that could be dangerous to individuals to release . here 's a better idea , material is classified with a time limit set at time of creation . process is necessary to extend that , otherwise it gets declassified on expiration no i would argue that they shouldnt even classify anything just as long as cnn or fox can take care of making the most outrageous things irrelevant by day 's end . the people who believe the government should keep information from the people i belong to there should be some secrecy , but only if there is an active plan to resolve the problem ( as in a nation security situation ) , but it should be limited in order to encourage a speedy solution to the situation . at what point in the next 100 years do you want this information to be made public , for every single one of 144 + organizations or gov ' ts with enough resources to do with as they please ? however , if the atrocities were bad enough a nations involvement could still be damaging to their current foreign policy . the nanking massacre was almost 100 years ago , if i were in charge of a nation and found out we had a major role in that there is no way i would want it released , as it would hurt out current foreign policy . even japan releasing the documents , would harm thier relationship with the person who helped . ireland , the balkans , and pretty much the entire middle east for example have seething hatreds that go back well over 100 years . imperial japan has a lot of dirt that is approaching 100 years old that korea , china , and others are still very bitter about . details of some atrocities from a century ago can very easily be used as a rallying cry for escalating these issues into renewed conflict . on top of that you have no way to ensure the other side releases accurate records , so the declassification can paint you in a very different light than an actual objective look at the historical context . i think the problem you ’d run into with declassification is you ’d have to sync up with other nations and discuss whether the declassification of a particular study or historical information could cause panic for global security . there are some programs and studies out there that you do n’t want in the public ’s view . do n’t think there should be a set 100 year declassification date but instead a reasonable philosophically moral team of members from every country came together to vote on information that should be declassified , it ’d be more secure for global security . well , it ’d be the geneva convention of global security and information declassification . there would be a representative of each government voted by their people to come together with the other members of nations across the world who were also voted by their people who are well studied in the philosophy of law , ethics , computer , science , religion , politics , and logic . these leaders have clearances and access to top secret / classified databases of their government and throughout the year , their job is to read the top secret/classified information and with their philosophic judgement , ask if this is something the world is ready to hear and know about and understand . then , the individuals bring the information they ’ve gathered over the year and have a vote on the information with the members of other states in a secure location where there are no phones or other electronic devices allowed . if it is voted that the information be declassified , so be it . possibly a suitcase of some sort that , once closed , ca n’t be opened without a key from the secure location where the documents are presented . there are a number of logical assumptions i 'm seeing here in your viewpoint that i 'll try to break down and then give a counter-point to your core thesis of hard line declassification dates . firstly , that classification is a veil through which bad actors conceal their actions . are you referring to actions that are morally dubious ( black ops ) but in the interest of their country ? if so those actions would nominally be protected to protect the interests of the country . in that case openly revealing such behavior serves to discredit the institution , the country , and most importantly for clandestine services potentially reveal ways and means . secondly , you make the leap from declassifying the service records of clandestine actors to declassifying all records into the public domain . the benchmark of 100-years is a bit convoluted as the majority of the us clandestine agencies formally were founded in the late 1940s . they have n't even existed for 100 years though certainly technologies at their foundation are still being used whether directly , see the dprk , or iterative of that technology are still in use . to declassify that information without review would compromise ways and means and as a result put a country 's intelligence efforts at a loss . lastly , you allude to the mass declassification as being some net positive to society . even as it pertains to the service records of clandestine actors , that person 's family would certainly have to confront the reality of their service record however bloody or dubious it may be . but of concern for me , the consequence that would follow someone 's service record being put into the open-source would invite retaliation by adversaries whether foreign or domestic . it is a strong sentiment that we as a collective would rectify our dirty deeds but is that worth putting the family members of those people at threat ? the core thesis of your viewpoint , at least from my perspective , is that declassification is a disinfectant towards bad actors and while this has some truth to it , i do n't know if you 've plumbed the follow on effects it would have both for individuals and the state : in the event some action was taken , nominally someone of consequence being killed , there would certainly be "" blow back "" by vindictive actors . even if it were 100 years later , states would have a direct incentive to strike back on declassified families as a chilling effort towards recruitment and continued operations . why would anyone send actors into a theatre if in 100 years their kids could be killed as a result ? why would any foreign actor collaborate with a state ( serve as informant ) if those records would be released and their families would be at risk ? the state would be compromised for their abilities to continue intelligence operations . rubber stamp declassification would see the ways intelligence is gathered and the means by which it is gathered at huge risk . there are decryption techniques from wwii that remain classified not for novelty sake , there is an associated cost with that storage and archival , but because the source encryption is still in use 80 years later . declassification is a thing , at least in the us , a record is up for review periodically and is seen by a board which hears a defense as to why it should remain classified . i 'm curious however what / u/yuccu has to provide as insight as well . i used to work on freedom of information act requests , the process for classified materials to be made declassified based on requests made to the us federal government , for the us military . i solely worked on secret classified materials and , for the most part , we declassified most of the requests that came across our desk . we made redactions only where necessary following foia guidelines — mostly for things that still had implications for current policy or national security secrets that can have implications on our foreign policy . once we made recommendations , we would need to solicit interagency feedback from more than 5-10 separate federal agencies for their feedback too depending on the issue at hand . the foia guidelines for redactions ( i forgot what the actual name of this is ) is publicly available and these documents are being released upon request , depending on what you want to know and who is making the request . you will not believe how many federal government officials or military generals in the past have argued the case for disastrous foreign policy or even war/nuking a country . god only knows what some of the top secret / / sci classified materials would say . but this is just one example — what i mean is that sometimes releasing this very sensitive information affects the foreign policy of other countries towards the united states and can have dangerous implications when we are in sensitive scenarios with moving parts . i do n’t know what the answer is , but i knew for certain that some redacted classified information from even 50 years ago ( when i would review these foia requests ) would definitely turn out to become foreign policy disasters for us even if released today . i think that ’s why it ’s difficult to just say with a blanket statement that all classified materials past 100 years should automatically be declassified . the number is just subjective , the material and information is the piece we should be discussing . instead , i think perhaps the definition for what should remain classified under national security auspices should be rather more clearly defined because that is the challenge with so many people reviewing the same documents without the same expectations or standards . so many things fall into the “ national security ” bucket and just remain classified . when i worked for the military , we believed we were declassifying information to civil society and government transparency groups for the sole purpose of increasing transparency . there isnt a conspiracy to hide the us ’ secrets at the bureaucratic level . the presidency and partisan considerations depending on who is in the white house , however , can change that ... a principle to declassify things after 100 years could be good , free societies do need to balance security with transparency . and very few people live 100 years , so almost everyone involved should be dead by that point . people die but not everything that 's classified is about people . because no matter what year it is , releasing the notes of the manhattan project would be a terrible idea that will likely get millions of people killed . it does n't matter if it 's 2045 or 2845 , making that information public will never ever be a good idea . if you want a blanket rule that applies to all things without regard for content , you 'd need to declassify the manhattan project 's notes . if you do n't want to reveal those notes , than we both agree it should n't be a blanket rule we just might disagree about how exceptions are made . we need people making decisions about what can or ca n't be kept secret forever , and our check has to be electing people we trust to make those decisions in the best interest of the country ."
9rhsov,"your birth was n't an accident and it was n't random the famous philosopher , phil donahue , came up with an idea about immigration . that he was blessed by the random accident that he was born a few miles north of the border rather than south . a lot of people buy into this idea , while a lot of other people disregard it for the wrong reasons , and some people will come up with convoluted arguments against the idea , but it 's actually pretty simple to debunk . it 's impossible for phil donahue to have been born south of the border . it 's impossible for him to have any other parents than his own . perhaps his parents did n't plan it out , but it would be physically - or i should say , genetically impossible for him to have been born to any other parents than his own . his birth parents and location was not an accident or random . it 's genetics . which leads to the second portion of the argument - that phil donahue personally has no more claim to being an american than a mexican . what has donahue done to earn his place as an america ? no more than a mexican , correct ? correct , but it ignores the freedom of choice . his citizenship has been bestowed upon him and not the mexican or foreigner due to his forefathers . it 's been inherited . it 's like saying the house your parents wanted to leave to you when they died is n't actually yours . or better yet , the house you own you ca n't decide who gets that house when you die . citizenship , in a certain sense , is bestowed upon you much like familial inheritance - it 's bestowed upon you by the laws of the united states .","i think the idea of the comment was that a person born say in denmark has been born into an extremely privileged circumstances , by luck not merit . are you saying that hypotheticals about a person 's identity are inherently nonsensical because the person with different features or circumstances in this hypothetical would by definition no longer be you ? if so , i think you 're taking a thought experiment too literally . often the point of a thought experiment is to isolate a principle or the logical of an argument from the worldly circumstances surrounding it so we can examine it in a vacuum . a thought experiment does n't have to be physically possible ; it only has to keep the relevant principle intact . and in this case , the idea the thought experiment is asking you to explore is this . you could argue that this is mechanically impossible , but that would be irrelevant to the thought experiment , like rejecting the trolley problem on the basis of some mechanical feature of trolleys . i do n't think the argument is meant to convey ' if things had been different , i would have been born somewhere else ' so much as ' i had no control over my parents ' lineage or the country i was born into ' . obviously , if birth circumstances had been different , it would n't have been ' you ' that was born in the first place . my ancestors immigrated to the united states because of troubles in their home countries . that 's True , but does n't actually resolve the conflict raised in the philosophical concept ( pioneered by rawls as the veil of ignorance ) , wherein all of those things which are "" inherited "" are still by no virtue of the person inheriting them . but that 's not quite the argument of the veil of ignorance or that inheritance ( including of nationality ) is unearned . in some places you argue something roughly equivalent to "" they deserve the citizenship because that 's the law of the land they were born in "" . and unless you believe in a strong version of the philosophical view called legal positivism ( where there is no basis for the law other than the law ) , one can not defend the justness of a law because the law exists . ignoring that "" personal accountability "" is a bit of a vague phrase ( since many would argue that inheritance is the opposite of personal accountability ) , you are here arguing that the laws should exist as they do because the laws themselves are moral . either the law is self-justifying ( we deserve whatever happens under the law of the land , good or bad ) , or can be judged as a moral question ( inheritance is a moral good and should exist ) . are you arguing that , because a particular person could n't possibly exist if the timing and circumstances of their birth were in any way changed , that person deserves citizenship in the country of their birth ? what if the border was at a different place , what if any of his forefathers did not move when they did , what if they had not been exiled or made to flee or ... there are countless possibilities of how he could have been born few or many miles away . i do n't think that has much to do with the idea that one is lucky to have been born an individual in a rich nation though . you 're taking the "" accident of birth "" idea too literal . it 's a thought experiment , to show that many things we take for granted , should not be seen as inevitable . for example , when people unquestioningly assume that the culture , religion , traditional worldview etc. they were brought up in must be the best one , it can be helpful to bring up this thought experiment . if everything about you is the exact same , except for where your mother gave birth to you ( an event which you have absolutely no control over ) , why should this so drastically change your future ?"
9rhdh5,"taxes and open borders are inherently capitalist a government is just a business without ( hopefully ) a profit motive . it provides services , i.e. infrastructure , law enforcement , etc. in exchange for a fee , taxes . obviously it ’s normal to want a cheaper product , but wanting no taxes is just wanting services for free . but wait , you ’ll say , i did n’t choose to receive these services , i should n’t be forced to pay for something i did n’t choose to receive . this is why open borders are also capitalist . if a government is a business , restricting entry and therefore exit is enforcing a monopoly . open borders create competition between countries , allowing the people to select a better product and forcing governments to improve such that some consumers will choose them .","every system in the world that has existed for as long as it 's been able to write it down has taxed people . i do n't see the capitalist side of it though . as for open borders ... there 's a reason nobody does that outside of a select few special cases which are themselves insulated as a whole . it 's no different than a business only in the sense that if you only need 5 employees but you hire 100 , it wo n't be long before you fold . opening borders certainly would n't be a model of competition in action . no company has ever been capable of operating this way . they do n't need to . they either have people leaving or people clamoring to get in . the countries that do n't compete would love open borders . after all , they could encourage all their most unproductive citizens to head off to greener pastures ( thereby turning those places into the shitholes that the people who just came in left ) the countries that compete the best already attract the best and brightest . i guess you could call it competition of a sort but it 's certainly not capitalist . if you 're talking about the capitalism in terms of the us and eu economies , then you could make the argument for taxes as an investment for business , but any taxation that does n't allow easier economic function would be hard to argue as anything but socialist in nature . additionally , open borders is fundamentally a bad idea for this business like government as its employees would find themselves underpaid and unable to provide as much in revenue due to the flooding of the labor market . after all , this business of yours makes its money off of internal transactions between its employees and if those employees are underpaid , they make fewer transactions . therefore , taxation is not a capitalist ideal as you do not agree to be taxed , you are only told to pay it . in the case of borders , there are none in this system because there is no government . so in a way , open borders are n't really capitalist either as the idealized form of capitalism has no borders to begin with . taxes are basically the opposite though ; you ’re taking money from individuals and using it to provide national services , that ’s inherently socialist ( not saying the us is socialist , but it has some socialist entitlement programs ) . regarding open borders i do agree , it provides cheap labor and such . the people coming into the country will often utilize them , which puts a noticeable drain on the economy ( government spending goes up , taxes go up if no cuts are made ) . also , from the view of a capitalist businessperson , it really depends on how you are viewing it . if you are using the newly found population for cheap labor or for increased consumer base , then sure . if these people are creating businesses that contend with yours then you might be opposed to it . in general however i ’d say open borders in the absence of entitlement programs would be favored by capitalists first issue i have with this is : all businesses are profit driven , that 's how businesses determine their success/failure . secondly , a capitalistic economy is a private exchange of goods and services , ie : i pay you for something . with taxes , it 's regulated and mandatory , regardless if you want , use , or need the service . also , businesses charge people based on the goods or services provided , but with taxes , you are required to pay for a certain amount because of how much money you make per year . thirdly , government dont just use taxes for goods and services , they use the taxes for welfare as well . also , with open borders , it would allow people to live or claim residency in one country while working in another ( assuming this would be the main advantage for open borders ) . so the question would be , which country would that person pay taxes to since that person would be getting services from both countries . if you suggest that person pay taxes to both countries , then everyone would live and work in the same country . tldr : taxes by default are not capitalistic because it 's not an exchange of goods and services . both taxes and open borders predate capitalism by millennia , they were both common practice going back thousands of years , we know that they existed in ancient sumeria at the same time that the written word first appeared . for public goods , it 's not really like that because people could walk across the open border to use the free services without paying tax . it would be alright if you had to prove you were a taxpayer before you could cross the street though , or before the police would arrest the guy who 's beating you up . for services that can require proof of identity , that seems theoretically possible , but i have a feeling people in a country will feel guilty seeing all those starving immigrants who get no social welfare or healthcare dying in the streets . they would have some sense of moral duty to give them free services when they 're in their own backyard . they 'd rather leave them to suffer in some other country so they do n't feel responsible for it . one way governments could make their country more attractive is to be picky about who they let in , just like capitalist private schools , restaurants , clubs , etc. do . an exclusive country only for high achievers would attract high achievers who would pay more tax . so every country would try to become exclusive and attract only the best and not allow the worst . open borders would be too but would collapse under a free market for people to choose their country ."
9rgqfh,"the pipe bombs were fake and a ruse to get people to vote blue . before you downvote me to the pits of hell , hear me out . my reasoning behind this opinion is that : 1 . the democratic party has recently made many fake allegations against republican idols such as christine blasey ford 's rape accusation where she could n't remember anything or get a single witness to back her up or when they said that russia hacked the 2016 election 2 . if they were real bombs , they would n't have taken pictures , they would 've called a bomb squad . 3 . the "" bombs "" had no explosive material in them and no energy source or circuit to provide an instantaneous energy source for any known detonator 4 . because of how the "" bombs "" were constructed the worst they would 've done is puff fire out of the ends . all this has lead me to believe that the democrats are trying to lead people away from the republican party in any way possible .","suppose , for a moment , that you were sending out fake bombs to try to get people to vote blue . the bombs i know about have been sent to people trump complains about , and not to people who are likely to swing the election . would you send out all the fake bombs at once for one big news story , or would trickle them out to keep them in people 's minds ? now , of course , you can always say "" crazy people are crazy "" or "" it 's a double bluff , "" but this narrative of "" fake bombs for blue wave "" does n't really match up with what we 've seen so far . you should consider why you assumed the bombs were a False flag before assuming the much more likely fact they were sent in earnest by a pro-trump , anti-left individual . at no point did an investigation determine that dr. blasey ford leveled intentionally False allegations . clearly , you have insider information that only one person could have , the bomb maker . therefore , you are the bomb maker and you 're clearly not a democrat supporter . consequently , the bombing was not intended to get people to vote blue . abc news claims the bomb sent to george soros on monday was detonated by the fbi and is now being analyzed . using your exact same logic , i conclude that the republicans have purposefully sent fake pipe bombs to make it appear as though the democrats have sent fake pipe bombs to lead people away from the democratic party in any way possible ."
9rfzdc,"the recent decision by the ecthr to rule insulting prophet muhammad not ' free speech , ' - is a bad call . -- url -- have n't been able to find anyone advocating support for this motion . the general arguments against it seem to consists of : - holding islam to a lower standard than other religions which are expected to be able to tolerate criticism - reverting back to antiquated blasphemy laws . opening up a precedent e.g. should insulting jesus , buddha or odin be a violation of free speech ? - an example of islamaphobia ; having such a bigoted opinion of muslims that it is assumed they will become violent in response to insults - further fueling right-extremism amongst the european public who already feel that issues around immigration have not been handled well i do n't actually have strong opinion on this , but have not seen much in the way of contrary views .","i 'm sure someone , somewhere , is going to point out that she might have been pubescent and therefore it 's not an instance of pedophilia but hebephilia instead ... let 's just agree to ignore that guy . the austrian courts clearly looked at the context of the insult and determined that it was not made in good faith ; it was intended explicitly to provoke outrage in muslims and non-muslims alike . i 'm not an expert on austrian or eu law , but it seems to me that the ruling here is very context-dependent . i would be willing to go to austria right now and say , "" no one disputes that the prophet had a sexual relationship with a ~ ~ 12 ~ ~ 9 year old , which today we would consider pedophilia , "" right in front of a judge and i would n't fear arrest , because i would n't be saying it to incite anyone to anger ."
9rfkfk,"expanding the earned income tax credit is better than implementing a universal basic income so over the past few years , there has been discussion over the merits of a universal basic income or ubi . i would like to share my thoughts on the matter which is that i am not in favor of a universal basic income . i would much rather see an expansion for the earned income tax credit , a tax credit that benefits milllions of low-income single parents in america , than to have the government give sums of money on a monthly basis with no work requirements . so onto my proposal ... many low - and moderate-income americans often struggle due to the combination of the rising cost of living and stagnant wages over the past few decades . ( davidson , 2018 ) with the advent of an evolving economy , it is important that hard-working americans have the resources needed to succeed . outsourcing and advancements in technology are displacing millions of labor jobs and these changes can put these individuals at a disadvantage when it comes to their financial stability . the current earned income tax credit mainly targets low-income single parents , which serves as a great starting point for enhancing economic progress . that said , if it were expanded , more americans could be lifted out of poverty and have more resources to accomplish their financial goals and contribute to the connected economy . ultimately , the solution going forward would be to expand the working americans credit , my proposed new name for the earned income tax credit , to provide financial support for more underrepresented groups of people . the wac would be paid for by a modest value-added tax on businesses . another important point to include would be poverty ’s impact on mental health . research from the urban institute reveals that living in high-poverty , disenfranchised areas can result in severe strain to the mental and emotional health of residents . ( jordan , 2013 ) the research goes on to show that poverty can instill a psychological burden so heavy that economically disadvantaged people would be left with little attention to accomplish everyday tasks . in addition to the frequent anxiety and grief that comes from living in a disenfranchised neighborhood , and dealing with food insecurity , facing financial difficulties can use up a person ’s mental capacity , which could have otherwise been used for more productive activities . while financial insecurity is only one issue , if addressed by changes in public policy such as my proposal , then poor americans would have more resources to contribute to the economy , which in turn can benefit society as a whole . in the realm of helping the disenfranchised , there are those who have different ideas on how to solve the issue . there are proponents for a universal basic income , or a guaranteed monthly income from the government that usually does not involve a work requirement . one problem with a universal basic income is that it fails to account for human nature ; in the sense that if someone receives money without working for it , then they may have less of an incentive to work . in addition , an entitlement mentality behind ubi may form which can put political pressure to increase it , thus adding to the costs of a ubi . my proposal would be more of a subsidy for low - and some moderate-income individuals than a basic income . for instance , only individuals who meet certain income eligibility requirements would be eligible for this tax credit . to summarize , my proposal is that the working americans credit should be expanded to cover more low - and moderate-income americans , in order alleviate the financial stress and improve the mental health outcomes of low - and moderate - income americans . an expanded working americans credit would help combat poverty , incentivize work , and improve the mental health for millions of americans . at a time when the economy moving towards automation , it is important that the most disadvantaged americans have the resources needed to be financially secure . ## proposed eligibility guidelines for 2018 ( hypothetical ) | if filing ... | zero children | one child | two children | three children or more | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | single , head of household or widowed | $ 24,200 | $ 44,200 | $ 48,600 | $ 52,800 | | married filing jointly | $ 29,200 | $ 49,200 | $ 53,600 | $ 57,800 | ## investment income limit investment income must be $ 4,650 or less for the year . ## maximum credit amounts the maximum amount of credit for tax year 2018 is : $ 8,038 with three or more qualifying children $ 6,516 with two qualifying children $ 5,300 with one qualifying child $ 2,810 with no qualifying children","your expansion of the earned income credit will not help anyone that ubi is intended to help for 2 reasons . these people already qualify for the existing tax credits because of how low their incomes are . these people would be moving from low paying jobs to having no jobs at all as automation spreads so they will be paying no taxes . the whole point of ubi is to incentivize having less kids and working less . in the future , computers will be able to do a lot of the work that humans do today . instead of having 10 capitalists and 90 laborers , we 'll just have 10 capitalists and a bunch of robots and computers to do the work . to accomplish this , we want to incentivize people to have fewer kids . the next point is that if robots and computers do all the work , we do n't want humans to do any manual work if can avoid it . instead humans should ask questions about the universe and do scientific research to answer them . we should write poems and paint murals because those are things that humans can do , but robots and computers ca n't . your eitc proposal incentivizes having more kids because you get more money if you have more kids . ubi incentivizes having less kids because you get to keep more of the money if you share it with less people . the ideal state for humanity would look like a slave plantation , except instead of humans owning other humans , humans would own objects that do the work for us . we would lower our population level until we can sustainably live forever on earth 's resources . it 's like how if you have 10 million dollars in the bank , you can withdraw $ 100,000 ( 1 % of the total amount ) essentially forever because it is less than the interest rate you get from a highly safe investment . eitc is great and your idea is certainly better from a political perspective -- meaning an expanded eitc would be easier to pass into law and most people agree on it . does n't work if you 're unemployed , taking care of a sick family member , homeless/jobless , etc . and it does n't increase bargaining power for low-wage workers in general the way an unrestricted wage floor would . plus welfare , unemployment , food stamps , and the like create weird welfare cliffs and ubi/nit does not . ( afaik the eitc does n't create cliffs , but if it has to exist in tandem with programs that do , you 're kind of arguing for the cliffs by preferring an expanded eitc . )"
9rfgd1,"being pro-gun and pro-gun control is actually the smartest and most realistic view . to start i live in california , and i tend to think i am ideologically liberal and fiscally conservative . i love gun 's and think you should be able to own a semi or fully automatic rifle of what every caliber you like , there should not be any restriction on magazine size , suppressors or optics and you should not need a bullet button or anything like that . but to be able to have that freedom to own those types of firearms you must complete xhrs ( maybe 100 or something ) of firearms training . you need to register all firearms no matter how you purchase them . and background checks should include mental health evaluations that also need to be done again every 2 or 3 years . i 'm not saying this is the perfect solution , but it seems the vast majority of liberals tend to be of the mindset that guns are bad and no one has a need for any firearm except for a hunting style rifle/shotgun or maybe a hand gun but no ar style firearms . conservatives tend to think that the should have any type of firearm they want and that there should be hardly any regulations at all about how they purchase firearms , and should not have to register their firearms at all . "" a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed "" ( i took out all the comma 's ) conservatives tend to only read the last part from ' right to bear arms ' onward . the whole notion of well regulated is completely ignored . i cant seem to grasp why the vast majority of people on the left and the right cant see that neither of the all or nothing types views will never work and honestly do n't make that much sense practically either . i also do n't think the gun/car comparison is n't that far off . treat firearms like a more regulated drivers license ( the dmv is a joke and it should be much more like germany but that a different topic all together ) as long as you get all the requirements license , insurance etc you can buy any car you want . no one needs a 800hp car and they are usually far worse for the environment but you can buy them no problem . p.s. sorry for all grammar and spelling errors , and i look forward to you all helping me understand your views and possibly changing my mind .","understand this , in the long run , gun laws do very little to prevent crime . because anyone can fake sanity and can do evil things with said gun . gun laws shouldnt be prevenitive , they should be incentivised to train and stop evil people . people who make gun laws , pro or anti should be versed in firearms enough to understand a how a firearm works and actually shoot one . the government has no business knowing what or how many firearms i own . giving the feds the power to grant you firearm ownership means that it is no longer a right . furthermore , the idea behind 2a is that we are able to defend ourselves from a tyrannical government . that makes the lower class prone to being stepped on as they would be rendered defenseless . no illegal drugs , no gangs to fight over territory to sell them . quick question , why do n't you go to your senate and ask for better law enforcement in the streets , combating violent crimes ( because , all in all , this is why you want a gun in the first place , right ? ) crime rates in america are bigger than anywhere else and you can mention one or two with higher numbers of violent crimes , but at the end of the day , the most pacific countries have all banned gun use . i can think of a dozen more that allow registered gun possession ( for hunting or sports ) . if you think those requirements would be over the top for voting , then how in the world would you apply that standard to an activity that the constitution clearly says "" shall not be infringed "" ? im an avid gun advocate , yet i see no reason to have automatic rifles in the hands of civilians . in fact , in oregon , the authorities are not enforcing background checks or ffl requirements for private gun sales . you can go to a yard sell or swap meet and buy a handgun or rifle no questions asked . it seems that you believe that all conservatives believe there should be no regulation ( or "" hardly any "" ) on firearms , and that liberals believe there should be no guns at all . i recommend taking a look at this article which shows some statistics on gun control opinions . both those who do and those who do not own guns seem to be in agreement that people with a mental illness or people on the no-fly lists should be banned from owning a gun . if you can get a gun so can criminals , all it does is make conflict deadlier . i know criminals will still get guns even if they ’re banned or heavily restricted but common criminals wo n’t be able to afford guns and neither will school shooters . i believe gun rights are important because self defense is a human right , and guns are an important tool in that regard . i also recognize that guns are dangerous and there are some gun laws that might help make us safer with little or no negative effect on our rights . you seem to be of a similar mind and cited some good examples of gun laws that are pretty reasonable . the democrat / anti-gun lobby claims they want the same thing -- i.e. compromise and "" common sense "" gun control . no democrat ever offers to amend or repeal gun laws , even ridiculously outdated ones that were passed in the 1930s as a way to arrest prohibition gangsters . a poll was done earlier this year and among persons identifying as democrat : 82 % said they would "" somewhat "" or "" strongly "" favor a ban on semi-automatic weapons . 65 % said they would "" somewhat "" or "" strongly "" favor a ban on concealed carry . 44 % said they would "" somewhat "" or "" strongly "" favor a ban on all handguns . 39 % said they would "" somewhat "" or "" strongly "" favor repealing the second amendment altogether ( with 20 % "" not sure "" ) . but when it comes to guns , i think the democrats really are the bad guys they have been made out to be . i wish we could have reasonable discussions on gun laws , but you ca n't really negotiate with someone who is singularly focused on stripping away your rights . two , regulated meant the militia should be capable , in good working order . the people having their own guns and knowing how to use them contributes to the well-regulated militia . in times of crisis , when a militia needs to be called , it would be nice if everyone could do that . you mean i can buy whatever gun i want , even a machine gun , with absolutely no regulation , restriction , or government oversight whatsoever , as long as i do n't use the gun on public property . only if i plan to , say , carry concealed or hunt on public property , do i need a license and to register that one gun ."
9rf09y,"it is incorrect to assume that mental illness causes gun violence . although after mass shootings/other gun violence events occur , the assumption is often made that 1 ) mental illness directly causes gun violence ; 2 ) psychiatric diagnosis could have predicted these crimes ; 3 ) mass shootings in the u.s. give us reason to fear mental illness ; 4 ) gun control will not stop the complex psychiatric problems that motivate firearm violence . although these assumptions may be True or negotiable on a case-by-case basis , these are blanket statements that create mental illness stigma , and force the issue of gun violence onto mental instability rather than a lack of strict gun control . as stated by macleish et al. , there is a staggeringly low amount of evidence suggesting that individuals diagnosed with mental illness pose more of a threat than any other civilian . approximately less than 3-5 % of gun crimes monitored in the u.s. are the result of an individual diagnosed , or later found to have , a mental illness . seeing as the statement "" mentally unstable "" is extremely subjective , the ability to classify an individual as "" ill "" or not is also very ambiguous . additionally , scholars of violence prevention mention that because mass shootings are infrequently occurring , sporadic events , using them as evidence for causation between mental illness and gun violence creates a great distortion . & #x200b ; source : [ -- url -- )","i believe that stopping this type of mass shooting will really hinge on tackling mental illness , but if we ’re talking the grand majority of gun violence it ’s not going to be the solution . many mental illnesses , particularly clinical depression , vastly increase the risk of suicide . i do n't think anyone has ever claimed "" mental illness causes gun violence "" . the narrative is more along the lines of "" people with certain mental illnesses prevent a greater threat when they have access to firearms . even the author says , "" less than 3-5 % of gun crimes ( not gun violence for some reason ) are the result of an individual diagnosed or later found to have a mental illness "" he then does n't really describe what he means when he says mental illness . this study actually showed that : "" a man with schizophrenia was four to five times as likely to commit a violent act as a man in the general population "" . once treated , patients are no more likely to be violent than the general population . i disagree with the unsupported conclusions some people will draw from this , and the blanket statements . while there is a somewhat higher risk from untreated schizophrenics , this does n't mean that shootings are generally a mental illness issue . firstly nobody thinks gun crime is generally caused by mental illness . they think the public mass shootings are caused by mental illness . because the vast majority of those people are on psychotropic drugs for their diagnosed mental illness . second nobody thinks mental illness directly causes even mass shootings either . your first 4 logical throughlines are wrong because you start talking in 1 about gun violence , then you switch that to mass shootings in 3 , then you go back to gun violence in 4 , which means that your entire logical structure is flawed because nothing goes from a to b to c."
9reh37,"the mainstream movement for trans rights is rife with misogyny . i 'd like to start out by saying that when i say "" trans rights activism "" , i do not mean all trans people . there are both trans and cis people perpetuating what i see as misogyny within trans rights activism . there are also trans people who march to the beat of their own drum , and do n't seem to be perpetuating these misogynistic attitudes . this cmv is solely about my view of the mainstream movement for trans rights . with that said , i 'll dive right into the reasons why i hold this view . using a throwaway because i do n't want to be harassed , threatened , doxxed , etc. on my main account for expressing these views . - female anatomy is taboo ... again . these days , anytime i see a depiction or reference to female anatomy -- especially if it is connected to feminism -- i see hundreds of comments disparaging such a thing as "" terf-y "" . the best example of this is the backlash against the "" pussy hats "" at the women 's march . it should be obvious to anyone that the hats were a reference to trump 's "" grab 'em by the pussy "" quote , but tone-deaf activists ignored that fact and chose to be offended by the mere suggestion that vaginas and women are related things . interestingly , even though there are both trans women who do n't have vaginas and trans men who do n't have penises , vaginas/ovaries/uteri / etc. are the only sex-specific parts deemed "" trans exclusionary "" . i find this fishy , to say the least . in feminist discourse , we enjoyed maybe ... five minutes of thinking that female anatomy was something we should teach people about and not be ashamed of . i guess it was nice while it lasted . - erasure of sex-based oppression women worldwide are oppressed based on both gender roles/stereotypes and their biological sex . the trans rights movement would seek to erase the latter from the category of "" women 's issues "" , presumably because acknowledging this is "" invalidating "" to trans women . but this is ridiculous . there are plenty of women 's issues that do n't affect all women . for example , fgm is a women 's issue . women in first-world countries usually do n't experience it , but that does n't mean they are n't women . this mentality is especially damaging at this point in us politics , when reproductive rights for women are hanging in the balance . pushing this issue to the margins to spare some people 's feelings is not worth the damage that will be caused if those rights are stripped away . - it reinforces harmful stereotypes about women . this is a big one . one of the more ridiculous claims i 've seen come out of trans activism as of late is the idea that trans women get periods . not bleeding , obviously , but the claim is that they get a "" time of the month "" where they become bitchy and moody , "" just like cis women "" . it may surprise them to learn that only 20-30 percent of cis women report emotional symptoms consistent with pms . perpetuating the belief that all women get pms is helping no one . this belief is one of many harmful stereotypes about women that leads to women being discredited , mocked , and not taken seriously . some people even believe women are not suited to hold positions of great power or responsibility due to pms making us "" overly emotional "" . there is also the belief that male and female brains have significant , fundamental differences , and that trans people 's brains "" match "" the brain of the sex they identify with . this idea that there is such a thing as "" lady brain "" has been used against women dating back to the time of darwin and beyond -- but there is a growing body of evidence that human brains are not as gendered as we thought they were . "" inferior "" by angela saini is a great resource if anyone wants to learn more about specific studies . finally , many of the testimonies i 've seen , especially those of the "" non-binary "" subset of trans people , rely largely on gender roles and stereotypes to explain why the individual does not identify with their birth sex . things like "" i like makeup "" , "" i play video games "" , "" i like math and science "" , are used as reasons why an individual identifies a certain way . my ( least ) favorite is when a female person gives the reason that it feels wrong to be treated as a woman , therefore they must not be a woman at all . news flash : being treated as a woman sucks . the implication that anyone who identifies as a woman is comfortable being treated as an inferior is insulting and harmful . there are several other reasons i hold this view , such as the "" cotton ceiling "" , allowing unfettered access for everyone into female-only spaces , etc. but i do n't want to make this post any longer than it already is . i look forward to having my view challenged ! thanks in advance for your thoughtful arguments .","i 've seen a terf march into a place where people are talking about trans issues and go "" well since you 're all ' feminists ' why are n't we talking about female genital mutilation ? "" and the people go , "" uh well we 're talking about trans stuff right now , "" and the terf replies "" aha ! that 's bad-faith , but there 's a less nasty version of this , where people just assume trans feminists are going to want to erase biological sex somehow . but there 's plenty of trans activists out there doing things like figuring out public health campaigns for getting trans men in for pap smears , and stuff like that . i have a personal friend who does that , and who is also active in trans activism , and she has never once been attacked for invalidating trans people by her peers . i mean people say this ( semi-facetiously ) about cis men all the time . descriptively , if you like wearing dresses , you like doing something associated with being a woman . there 's nothing counterproductive about acknowledging that the gestalt of "" woman "" includes certain traits , even as we simultaneously argue that these traits should not be part of gender . you ca n't possibly believe that "" i do n't identify as a woman "" and "" i dislike sexist discrimination "" are the same thing . it seems like a big jump from pointing to a few controversial issues that involve a seemingly small number of people , to your claim that the mainstream movement for trans rights is "" rife with misogyny "" . the most common definition of misogyny is hatred of women . trans people , who have gender dysphoria , have brain patterns similar to their idnetity than their assigned gender at birth ( -- url -- ) . as for the stereotypes - many trans people will overexagerate stereotypes of their identity ( both men and women btw , its not mysogyny ) . finally , as i said above , trans people are not exclusively women . because all of you arguments seem to relate exclusively to trans women ."
9ref0a,"using the same words to describe sex and gender is the reason for a lot of the modern debate about gender issues . i think the use of the word male and female for both sex and gender has led to a conflation of the two meanings in a sense . a lot of people where i am from think that sex = gender . while i know that gender is different than sex , i think we should use certain words to describe sex , and different words for gender . and gender should n’t really be a thing that is matters except on a social level . i ’m definitely up for hearing others opinions on this topic . just something that has been in my mind a lot recently","it is happening in countries that do not have a word for “ gender ” or at least did n’t have one before the debate started . people who want to debate that there ’s only two genders and two sexes are n’t interested in the vocabulary , and using different wording wo n’t appease them . saying that “ using the same word to describe sex and gender ” implies ignorance towards people who believe there ’s only two genders ; it implies that they do n’t understand that you ’re using a separate meaning between the words , which is n’t the case . just to say — better distinguishing between the words wo n’t help shift their views or make debating the two sides any less convoluted . words are defined by common use , and up until recently , sex and gender were used interchangeably . so i think you 're mistaken when you say that sex and gender have become conflated because that implies that gender and sex used to be distinct and only recently came to refer to the same thing . the fact that "" gender "" only recently came to mean something different than sex is evident in a few things . first , it 's evident in the fact that the majority of forms you fill out in hospitals and dentist offices still ask for your "" gender . "" well , these people are n't interested in your self-identification ; they 're interested in your biological sex . but they are using the word , "" gender , "" to refer to it . second , if you look at dictionaries from the 1980 's , you wo n't find gender being defined as having anything to do with how a person sees themselves or with how society thinks of traits associated with members of a given sex . what i 'm saying is that it did n't become common to use "" gender "" in this new way until recently . since words get their meaning from common use , it follows that the order of the change of meaning of "" gender "" is from being a synonym for sex to designating a person 's identity or behavior , and not the other way around . the modern debates have less to do with describing sex and gender . they do n't want change . and they 're also often driven by other ideological reasons , such as religious objections against non-traditional sex and gender views . the issue , for me at least , is the push for changing the body to represent their gender and pushing it on kids . i mean i roll my eyes cause it sounds like hipster nonsense , but my issue is this idea that body mutilation and hormone treatment is the answer is the big issue . we do have words that just describe gender — masculine , macho , feminine , effeminate , girly , butch , faggy , tomboy ... i think it ’d be more helpful to have less pejorative terms for people who are gender non-conforming definitely , but we do have plenty of words to talk about gender ."
9re2w2,"accusations of contemporary widespread police brutality and unjustified killings of black americans are False . the notion that there is widespread police brutality and unjustified killings of black americans in today 's america is contrary to data released by barack obama and eric holder 's own justice department and contrary to peer-reviewed research conducted at our most esteemed academic institutions . therefore , despite the numerous anecdotal examples carried in our media , despite the popular view amongst many black americans themselves , i must conclude that the allegations are False until i am made aware of any convincing data that says otherwise . i find this meme to be especially troubling because it is reinforced by many of our most prominent journalists as a given , as a confirmed fact , even though the empirical evidence is so lacking . some journalists , who are supposed to be filling the societal role of arbiters of truth , will often start a sentence with something like , "" given widespread police brutality against blacks ... "" or "" considering how often police officers murder black americans without cause ... "" , and i am always taken aback , because if they have any statistical evidence , they have n't shared it . the most common statistic that is communicated around this issue is that the police kill black americans at roughly double the rate per capita that they kill white americans . i have researched that statistic and found it to be accurate , although it should be communicated that it does not discriminate based on the circumstance of the killing . all police killings , no matter how strong the evidence for justification , are counted in that number . that the police kill black americans at 2x the rate of white americans says nothing about whether that rate is unjustified . to briefly employ argumentum ad absurdum , if no white americans ever interacted with any police officer ever , and if every black american was a serial killer , then the 2x rate would seem extremely low , considering the police would never even have the opportunity to kill any white people since they never interacted with them , but instead would constantly be engaged in dangerous and violent confrontations with known murderous fugitives who happened to be black . having made my point with the above hypothetical , i can now substitute in the real statistics straight from eric holder 's bureau of justice statistics . in reality , black americans commit murders at roughly 8x the rate of white americans . they commit robberies at roughly 9x the rate of white americans . they commit other violent crimes like assault and rape at similar multiples relative to white americans . and while these statistics are based on conviction rates , contrary to popular belief the evidence actually states that white criminals are more likely to be convicted for their crimes than black criminals ( because the rate of crime solving is dramatically lower in black communities than white communities ) . if black americans are committing murder and other serious violent crime at 8x the rate of white americans , but are only being killed by police at 2x the rate of white americans , how does that reflect as anti-black racism on the police ? if anything it demands and explanation why the police are killing so many white people . my theory is that the suburban and rural police that do n't have as much day-to-day experience with violent criminals as the urban police departments , are more trigger happy , and it is the predominately white communities in the suburbs and rural areas that suffer . peer reviewed statistical analyses of the data agree with my amateur analysis . for example , the ( black ) harvard university economist roland fryer found that although black new yorkers were marginally more likely to have been more roughly handled by the police , things like the use of hands , handcuffs , or having weapons drawn at them , 16 % to 25 % more likely depending on the specific action , that the use of deadly force is actually the same or less common for black new yorkers as compared to white new yorkers . considering the data as i see it , i can not subscribe to the narrative that there is widespread police brutality or unjustified killings of black americans . but please cmv . sources : -- url -- -- url --","True , but we also have figures that narrow down the circumstances of police killings to see if the person killed by the police was a threat . in a measurement of people killed during arrest in 2012 , 31 % were black . excluding people who were reportedly attacking the officer , the proportion of black victims rises to 39 % . there is also a huge racial discrepancy between the killings of armed and unarmed victims . with a little over half of armed victims of police killings are white and nearly half are black , but unarmed black people make up nearly 2/3 of unarmed people killed by police . all of this paints the picture that police are more likely to use unnecessary lethal force against black people . black people are 3.5 x more likely to be Falsely convicted of sexual assault , 7x more likely to be Falsely convicted of murder , and 12x more likely to be convicted of drug related offenses . in addition , black people and white people use drugs at equal rates , yet are convicted of drug offenses at much higher rates . the only data that matters for this case is killing of unarmed and/or innocent individuals , you arr basing your argument on something else entirely . you ’re right that the rate at which specific crimes which were reported are investigated and closed at a lower rate in black communities . but that ’s not the same as the rate at which people are convicted of the crimes they commit . to wit : most drug possession cases ( which are not reported crimes which were then investigated , but rather are based on undirected police action ) are n’t counted as part of the rate of “ crime solving . ” so it ’s correct to note that the rate at which “ my car was broken into ” is solved is lower among black communities , that does not form a valid basis for your conclusion that “ white criminals are more likely to be convicted for their crimes than black criminals . ” so let ’s see where they got their data from : “ these homicide data are based solely on police investigation , as opposed to the determination of a court , medical examiner , coroner , jury , or other judicial body . ” first , this disputes your claim about the data being based on convictions . the bjs does n’t use convictions , but rather relies on police conclusions . which means you are using data from police ( who are accused of being biased against minorities ) as evidence that the police are n’t biased because they arrested more black people for crimes . if you ’re asking in earnest this would mean you are compelled to consider an alternative explanation ( no less supported by the data ) : police allocate a much greater presence dedicated to arresting people in black communities . to use some simple figures , let ’s take a black community of 100 people , and a white community of 100 people . if ( in both communities ) 20 people will commit a violent crime , that would mean the only difference would be enforcement . in the black community let ’s assume the police have enough force to have cops who see nine of those fights , and they ’re notified of two more but only solve one . in the white community let ’s assume they do n’t put many cops on the street itself and do n’t see any of the crimes , but they ’re notified of four fights ( whites report crimes at higher rates ) and solve three of them . but if we take arrest records we have three white people who committed assault , but ten black people . “ black people commit assault at three times the rate of white people ! ” why do you presume that if the police are arresting more black people it ’s because they ’re committing more crimes ? there were nearly 6 times as many white people as there were black people . which means per capita deaths of unarmed black people was 7 times ( ! ) you said widespread brutality and killings are False but your nyt link indicates brutality is wide spread but killings are not . assuming you would agree that our past ( 50-100 + years ago ) , us law enforcement have treated minorities very unfairly . let 's just say for the sake of this discussion that we have a scale of how poorly and unfairly law enforcement treats minorities . we 'll call some random point ~ 70 years ago as a 10 for this scale and we 'll call zero racial bias a 0 on the scale . i would argue that as soon as social media became a thing and everyone started carrying around video cameras in their pocket we became exposed to information that would suggest we are n't at a 3 , we 're at a 6 and we just did n't know about it . the one thing we learn about big news stories involving police shootings , regardless of the race of killed suspect , is that police back each other up , and there are lots of documented cases of cover ups and falsifying police reports . if the police are willing to lie and falsify documents on cases that will be looked at under a microscope , consider how likely they are to lie and cover each other on everyday offenses . i might agree with you that focus on specific killings leads to misconceptions about the details . however , the existence of extensive racial bias within law enforcement and our justice system is apparent in study after study covering metric after metric . . those studies are just relying on things we know based on what police reported about themselves ."

9rdncc,"my vote never matters i just discovered this sub and i immediately thought of a questionable opinion i have had since i was old enough to vote . i 'm certain my vote in any kind of election with many voters , such as a presidential election , does n't matter . not one bit . let me explain my reasoning . imagine a vote between candidate a and candidate b , with one thousand people voting for either a or b . the only case where my vote has an impact on the outcome is if candidate a receives 500 votes and candidate b receives 500 votes . my vote would decide which candidate wins the election . in any other case my vote would not affect the outcome . already with only 1000 people voting it 's extremely unlikely the candidates will receive the exact same amount of votes for my vote to matter . now , when i imagine elections with millions of people participating , the chances of my vote having an impact on the outcome are astronomically low ! this reasoning prevents me from ever voting anywhere . the only way i could have an impact on the election is if i got many people voting for the candidate i support . if i had "" brainwashed "" 50 people to vote for my candidate , my "" vote "" would matter if the candidates have a difference of < 50 votes , which is far more likely than them having a difference of zero votes ( tie ) . & #x200b ;","lets continue to work through your example where a vote is tied 500 to 500 , and you get your chance . first off , in no real election would you know that , you would just vote and then find out the results . now , you might go down the path of saying "" no major election is decided by 1 vote , so if i stay home it wo n't change anything "" - but look at what would happen if everyone did that , no-one would get a say in anything ! i agree that your vote has essentially a zero chance of swaying the election . if you vote for the winner it increases their "" popular mandate "" ; if you vote for an opponent it reduces that of the winner . opposition parties , the media , and other branches of government tend to be more deferential to politicians that have broad popular support . you 're rewarding the politician for their policy positions and encouraging others to adopt them as well . let 's say you vote for a candidate that supports marijuana legalization . next election both the candidate and his/her opponent are going to be slightly more pro-legalization , relative to you not having voted . but your vote will have a real impact on policies that affect you . i argue that your vote means more than just who wins in the election . because the vote lives beyond that in data that politicians and political parties mine for information ( not to the point of finding out who pob voted for specifically ) . i 'm going to assume you 're a conservative white male , because reasons , and it does n't matter if i 'm right or wrong for my example . you being a college educated conservative white male have a high tech job making upper middle class income and personally benfited from the trump tax cut , but the republican candidate would sell you down the river in exchange for pleasing the watermen ( not fish people ) lobby who donates to his campaign . so you conclude that a vote against the republican doesnt matter . i say that exit polls , and demographic information of voters is increasingly important to politicians when developing , and evolving their platforms . if 100,000 educated white males with tech jobs vote for the democrat but the republican still wins by 1.1 m votes , you did n't change the outcome of the election , but the collection moved the white male demographic by 10s of percentage points . now the newly elected congressman from maryland has to consider what happened for him to lose so much support from a historical conservative block of voters . perhaps he now supports increased tech job migration to the 1st district through working for tax incentives or military contracts through congressional plus-ups . your vote mattered more than the result of the election . your vote matters in more ways than just whether you were the single deciding vote . if someone gets 50 % +1 votes , that sends a very different message to the legislature than if someone gets 95 % of the vote . it also signals that you 're a voter , which means your votes matter to the representatives . but if you 're a voter , they know that they 'll have to take your opinions into account when deciding their policy . if they know it 's going to be a close race , they 're going to work harder to get your vote by supporting policies that appeal to you . in your 501 / 500 example where you feel like you truly did matter , then all 501 people would have the same right as you to feel like it was their vote that made the winning difference . so , one could argue that all 501 peoples ' votes mattered . now , if we extend that logic a bit more using a different example - 502 / 500 votes . in that case , one of the two extra votes for the winning side is what ' decided ' that election , so taking the average your vote 50 % ' mattered ' . you assume that value only derives from the effect of your vote on the outcome , but voting itself has other effects . for example , by voting your are more likely to entice other to vote , which in turn can entice others . in a sense you contribute to the ethos of voting which draws more people to vote . having a strong ethos for voting benefits a democracy , avoiding misrepresentation by encouraging turnout . turnout is the deciding factor in most elections , and assuming those around you tend to have your political views , then the value of your vote helps increase turnout , which can easily decide the election you are in . even if you believe that individual votes do not matter , you must know that collective action does matter . by contributing to collective action , you can know you are not part of the problem of low turnout and misrepresentation , which probably will give you some satisfaction . its like cutting out meat from your diet for moral or environmental reasons : you do not want to contribute to the issue , and know that if your recognize an issue but do not do anything , then all you are doing is paying lip service . but let ’s say many many people adopt a rationale for not voting , the most common probably being “ my vote does n’t make any difference ” - take that to the extreme and you have very few people choosing all the representatives for everyone . if only 1000 people voted for president , your vote then would make a much more visible difference . but most likely , you 're right , in that your one vote will likely have no impact on the overall outcome . there was a difference of almost two million votes that won hillary the general vote , and your one hypothetical personal vote would n't have changed that a bit . trump won the presidency by about 80,000 votes in the right places , and again just one vote would n't have changed that either . that means that about 110 million people across the country could have voted , but did n't for whatever reason . if even a tiny percentage ( less than a tenth of a percent ) of those non-voters were people in the right place who think the way you do , and they changed their mind , they definitely could have resulted in a different outcome for the election . then obviously because there 's nothing special about your vote vs anyone else 's , if your vote does n't matter then no one 's vote matters . we know that whoever gets the most votes wins so clearly voting matters . your vote doesnt matter if you vote for a republican or democrat , especially in non swing state . becuase headcount keeps them on the ballot . and keeps them from having to spend massive resources to get back on the ballot in the next election . whether you consider the paltry amount of support 3rd parties significant is a seperate topic . but definitively they have numerical milestones they fight tooth and nail to hit . in many states you cant even start the 3rd party appeal process for ballot access until the middle of the race . while republicans and democrats are actively buying ads with 10x the budget , you are trying to collect signatures to allow people to vote for you other than by fill in in a democracy however if the prior candidate in the party achieved a certain percentage of vote , you can skip that step and actively focus on campaigning too . i voted for clinton , knowing it probably was n't going to matter . pennsylvania , michigan , wisconsin have a population of around 27 million and trump won those states by a combined 77,000 or so votes . one of the main reasons i always vote in local up to federal electronics is because i really do n't feel like i have a right to complain about anything that 's happening . even if my choice loses by tens of thousands of votes or more , i still feel like i did my part . so the fact of seeing how voting is not relevant can roughly be associated with a certain way of thinking , an ability to have a rational analysis of things , being someone more reasonable than average , and so on , or rather , basically the set of intellectual qualities you claim for yourself . now , let 's see you have two candidates , one of them is a very rational person that appeals to you and other people that think alike , because of their very relevant ideals an policies . the other one is ... a ridiculously self absorbed man who denies the most widely accepted scientific consensuses , reaches out to the vilest instincts of a certain kind of people , and proposing completely absurd thing such as building a wall at the frontier of ... err ... canada . now , most of the wise , reasonable and rational thinkers that are obviously more inclined to want the first person to win , and happen to be in greater numbers , just make the rational choice and stay at home . so , any person from the first group can say that his own vote would not have made a change . the error is to consider you are somehow special and the reasoning you have when you chose not to vote is relevant while it actually just is being part of the problem . when a candidate loses despite being more widely accepted than the other , every single person that did n't vote is at fault . when you did n't vote and your candidate loses , the only difference that your individual reasoning can make is make you think you can say "" we screwed up "" instead of "" i screwed up "" . it tells elected officials that beyond are watching and voting beyond members of high voting interest groups - pols behave different in places where 95 % of the pop votes vs 30 % regardless of whether or not your vote is decisive in terms of the outcome of an election , it is still important . in an ideal world everyone is well informed and either votes or consciously decides to abstain for political reasons ( not because they think their vote is meaningless ) . it ’s important that all citizens have their say , because even if you vote for the side with 80 % or the side with 20 % , these figures give a vital insight into public opinion . in my opinion it ’s best to look at votes like you would look at a census . your opinion , even if it is just a single piece of data in a vast sea of votes , is important because all of our votes combined provide society with an accurate representation of public opinion . a close election result will affect policy in a different way than if the election was won by a huge majority . every single year , there are houmdread of elections tbat only have a hand full of people voting ."
9rdk8f,"i 'm not opting in to be an organ donor it 's a waste of my time . i do n't care what happens after i 'm dead . i 'm too lazy to spend time dealing with the administration required to opt in only have no benefit for it . furthermore , i 'm a little bit paranoid that if i get into an accident , doctors will see i 'm a donor and spend less effort into providing care for me . btw i live in canada . to change my view , you present facts that indicate that i will receive tangible benefits while still alive for opting in . these facts must be True today or in the foreseeable future . arguments that are technically right but i wo n't consider : "" you may move to a country that has laws that incentives organ donor registry "" - moving into another country is n't really foreseeable . "" you may move to a country that has an opt out system where everyone is automatically an organ donor "" - actually i would support this system , again i do n't care what happens to my body after my death but would appreciate the increased availability of organs within the medical system . furthermore , this system is more like the government opting me into the system rather than me opting in myself .","as far as doctors go the doctors taking care of you and transplant dreams are separate . a separate organization checks your registration after you are declared brain dead . if i do n't care whether or not i eat a lollipop , i 'll take two seconds out of my day to give it to a kid that really wants it . if you do n't care either way , why not check a box when you renew your id to make the world a little better for somebody else ? what non selfish people need to do is identify people with your and deny you all aid . if we can do that successfully then we create an incentive for you be behave better . ok , you do n't care what happens after you die , so that means you also do not care about other people ? checking the box gives you nothing , but it could save the life of someone else . now , i do n't know how you could live your life currently knowing that you are refusing to check a box on a form that allows you to save someone 's life after you are dead . if you do n't feel an obligation or duty to act morally and treat people well , then of course nothing can motivate you . but if you care about being a moral person now , you certainly would live more satisfied knowing you are doing what you can . instead of being a donor ( thus alleviating your fears that doctors would n't save you ) , perhaps you would consider donating your body to a cadaver lab . gross anatomy is the lab where doctors train to become doctors . your body will be used to train a group of doctors who will then spend their lives saving others . your simple act of giving actually will save far more lives than just your few organs will . there 's an important difference there ; i 'm going to argue that by signing up to donate you produce a small increase in the chance of receiving a large benefit , rather than guaranteeing yourself a small benefit . high rates of organ donation can make signing up to donate a social norm , increasing the number of additional signups and/or increasing the likelihood of moving to an opt-out system . thus , your signing up is likely to increase the expected number of donated organs available by more than just your own organs . if so , every additional donated organ in the system will increase the chance of you getting one/decrease the time until you do get one , and hence have a very large benefit for you . the chance of needing an organ is minimal but the benefit is huge ; it 's certainly within the realm of possibility that the expected value of the benefit ( i.e. , chancevalue ) is greater than the cost of checking a box . i went to a bar one time that gave you a free beer every night when you handed them your drivers license and were an organ donor . by your logic , the possibility of saving money while you 're alive is enough to get you to opt in . i do n't know how they do it in canada , but here it 's just a box you check when you apply for or renew your license , so there 's no actual process that you are n't already doing . you 're obviously not too lazy to check a box , because you spent more effort writing a cmv about the topic . if you were so lazy that you totally did n't want to be an organ donor , you would n't be an organ donor and you would n't waste effort talking about it . the only "" tangible benefit "" you could possibly receive is the knowledge that in the event of your death , other people may get a second lease at life thanks to you expending the effort to check a box that one time . if the doctors let you die because you 're an organ donor , you 'd never know , but that would be illegal and unethical , and presumably , your family would demand the standard of care you think you should receive . the whole point of the organ donation system is that we need people to "" pay it forward "" . becoming an organ donor will allow you to brag honestly about being an organ donor . a little bit late to the party here but popping in to add : even if becoming an organ donor does n’t benefit you directly , other people becoming organ donors does . like you said , i have no incentive to become an organ donor for your sake , but i do have an incentive to get you to become one for mine . so a trade would benefit both of us - for the slight inconvenience of checking a box , i gain access to your organs if i need them and vice versa . of course you can still receive the benefits if you opt out , but on net a world where everyone is an organ donor is much better than a world where no one is . you are making a decision that has a minute benefit to you , but a very large detriment to other people . it is undeniable that the world as a whole would be better off if everyone made the non-selfish decision in this case . you want to make the selfish decision , and figure that it wo n't have any impact on whether other people make the selfish decision , so you 'll end up better off overall . because your decision to not be an organ donor is n't 100 % secret , it will have an effect on other people . the more other people see people making a selfish decision , the more they will feel okay making a selfish decision themselves . and the more you refrain from making selfish decisions , the more convincingly you will be able to argue for people to make non-selfish decisions . the more people who are registered as organ donors , the more other people will feel like they should be registered as organ donors . so you do get a tangible benefit from being an organ donor . the benefit you get is that you have a ( small ) causal effect towards other people being more likely to be organ donors as well , which makes it more likely that you will be able to receive a compatible organ should you ever need one . beyond that specific case , if you decide to be the kind of person who makes the decision that has a small detriment to themselves in exchange for a large benefit to others , you will encourage others to make those kinds of decisions as well . how do you expect to get a tangible benefit while you are are alive for donating organs when you die ? if your mother needed a kidney , and everyone behaved to your standard , your mother would die . the point is that it wo n't detract from you in any way ( idk how stuff works in canada , but here it takes minimal effort to register as a donor ) , whilst possibly providing an invaluable positive to the life of someone else . as for doctors not giving you care because you are a donor - doctors play no part in deciding whether organs of a patient are used for donation . that is an independent agency which uses various criteria to determine whether a dead individuals tissues can be used , and they have no sway in the day to day clinical decisions of doctors . a completely unfounded assertion , and one which would make absolutely no sense anyway - why would a doctor let die the patient infront of him on the table , who he has a direct legal and ethical duty of care to , just so that there may be a chance that someone else he does n't have a legal and ethical duty of care to will live ? all in all - organ donation has basically the highest "" good done : effort required "" ratio you can think of , so there is no logical reason not to do it ."
9rctrj,"parent 's should be allowed to act as gatekeepers for all information a kid is allowed to have access to . so this is speaking from two places , as literally everyone is , i am someone 's child , i am however also a parent . frankly i appreciate the sheltering my parents did for me . while i did n't agree with it at the time i believe it allowed me to grow into the productive member of society i am today . i believe all parents should be allowed to act as gatekeepers to all information their child receives including in school . note , a parent may give over some of that control by enrolling a student in a public or private school instead of homeschooling them . the moment a child turns 18 ( and is no longer a child ) they should be allowed and be able to evaluate things in a way that they are able to discern what is beneficial and detrimental to their own being . i understand this will likely be unpopular , and if you can give me a good reason why ( in the usa ) a parent should not be allowed to filter and be selective in information that reaches their children please let me know .","first , it takes an incredible amount of hubris to think that what you know/believe/feel is end-all be-all correct . considering you mentioned school specifically , that strongly suggests that you want to filter what your kids learn in school , what 's taught in high school and below are generally academically rigorous and are n't controversial among scientists/researchers/academics . if they are controversial , then different schools of thought are generally addressed within the curriculum ( psychology comes to mind . ) denying your kids exposure to these types of debates and topics does a disservice to them academically and cognitively . it 's really important to learn critical thinking , balancing viewpoints , and considering different perspectives in order to be a successful , functioning adult . denying your kids access to contradictory viewpoints is a terrible idea . we need kids to be exposed to a wide range of ideas , to learn to distill facts from opinions , to detect slant and bullshit , and to balance the evidence internally in a fair an objective way . schools exist to grant a child a basic education to help them be an educated member of society later on . a parent should not have the ability to override these basic educational requirements because that harms society and the child . so we 've limited the rights of the parent to prevent their kids from learning math , or the history of the us , or how government works . or is it simply to grant the overall most rights . and the cult lived in an underground bunker because they believed that the entire world was destroyed . would it be okay for their child to grow up completely in this underground bunker with no access to the outside world ? if there are 30 kids in a classroom , assuming they each have two parents that 's 60 people who can all decide they do n't want information to be dissipated . not to mention the fact that , as has been stated , children should not be the property of their parents . why is someone who is 17 years , 364 days old unable to discern what is beneficial and detrimental , while magically two days later , after turning 18 , they are ? what if this parent believes they are helping their child , or at least not harming their child , but has views that the rest of society would consider abhorrent ? what if they believe physical abuse as punishment is okay ? what if they raise their child to believe they should n't discuss these matters with other people because it is impolite , or even because those people 's parents may not have approved the topic ? if the influence of the rest of the world is filtered , how would a child know if their parent is lying to them or mistreating them ? democracy only works when a critical mass of the population is equipped with the intellectual tools and the moral values to make informed and ethical decisions regarding their representation in government . for example , democracy is useless in a society with no moral norms against political violence . as such , it is every parent 's civic responsibility to inculcate their children with these intellectual tools and moral norms . i do n't care what any parent 's stupid personal beliefs are , if they attempt to prevent their child from being indoctrinated in critical thinking concepts and liberal democratic concepts , they should have their children taken away . also , children have a right to a confidential patient relationship with a doctor , that parents have no rights to know about . children need to be exposed to the world so they can learn to make their own decisions . for example , both my parents are atheists , and i was raised in a house without religion . however , my parents always made it clear that we were free to explore religion in any context we 'd like , and that they would support it . when i had thoughts or questions , my parents shared their own views with me and asked questions about my own . i think your view also fails to take into account that while good people can have honest disagreements about the best way to raise a child , that does n't mean that there are n't any ways that are just objectively bad . there are certain things children and teenagers need to know , and withholding that information can have serious negative affects on their mental and physical health . for example , consider a homeschooling parent who believes homosexuality is a sin , and who chooses to prevent their child from learning that gay people even exist . how can that child grow into a healthy adult if they not only believe their feelings are sinful , but have no access to anyone else who shares those feelings ? sheltering a child is one thing , but completely controlling their access to information is another . it 's totally okay for parents to have control over whether or not their kid is ready for violent movies or the sex talk or complicated family history . but if a child is going to grow up to be a healthy and functional adult , they need to be allowed to explore the world for themself with increasing freedom as they mature . not bad enough to get their kids taken away , but bad enough that they raise their kids to be bigoted , or spoiled , or codependent , or vulnerable to exploration . why exactly does being a parent entitle you ( and possibly your spouse ) to be the sole arbiter ( s ) of your child 's development ? the ultimate goal of a parent is to protect their offspring and prepare them , as best as possible , for the world they love in ."
9rckpx,"one should feel more compelled to criticize their own political party rather than the opposing party i classify as a democrat . however , i criticize democrats more than i do republicans . at times , i actually feel inclined to defend republicans from the criticisms of democrats . i feel this way because i feel that raising awareness for the problems involving the democratic party will over time encourage the individuals who make up the party to improve . i believe that outwardly making these criticisms is a way to keep my political party in check . the democrat 's relentless criticisms of the republican party in the form of condescension , exaggeration , and misrepresentation is something that i criticize extensively . i believe that the parties differ due to distinct values arising from differing backgrounds ; they do n't differ because of any differences in moral character ( speaking in terms of the parties as a whole ) . i ca n't relate to republicans , but i also do n't feel inclined to challenge their beliefs because that reflects an entire lifetime of specific and distinct life experience . i believe that hubris on the part of the democrats is why we lost the 2016 election . this is something about the democratic party i believe needs to improve , and vocalizing this concerns are steps in the direction of progress . criticizing the opposing party does little in terms of progress . say someone begins a political debate with you . will you be more inclined to listen to them if they shared your political affiliation or had the complete opposite affiliation ? keeping your own party in check through constructive criticisms is more impactful than trying to challenge the fundamental beliefs of people who are politically different from you . & #x200b ; & #x200b ;","why identify with a party at all if you want to persuade people you are right it 's best to come off as an outsider who is above partisan politics and appeal to the general public disdain for career politicians . i do n't think you are wrong in saying that we should criticize the parties/ideologies/candidates we tend to agree with , but there 's a few points i think you should revise . you should always , unless the context makes this redundant , clarify that even though you have critiques , that they are still better than the other realistic alternative , and that you and everyone who thinks like you should still make sure vote for them or else a worse option will gain power . it 's very important to critique your opponents , so that anyone who 's wavering/ignorant can learn of their flaws . if one side spends its time critiquing itself publicly , and the other side spends its time critiquing its opponents publicly , then only one side gets critiqued , and however useful that critique is , it 's both pointless because they have no power as a result of bystanders only hearing the negatives of one side , and usually too disparate and contradictory to be of much use . you should spend your time critiquing the very concept of two parties , and the plurality / "" choose one "" voting system that creates the conditions that nearly require two parties . if there were more than two parties , and a system like star voting for voters to use to give an opinion of all parties , then each party would be getting criticism from several distinct alternate positions , but also defense/praise from several distinct alternate positions , and voters would n't just be choosing which "" side "" to pick , but rather what score each position deserves . this would do a much better job of improving the discourse than just hoping both parties in a two sided conflict will choose to act for the greater good at the risk of their own ideologies potential detriment and their opposing ideologies benefit ( if they critique their own side while the other side chooses to close ranks and just focus on their opponent ) . you have to choose between criticizing a republican policy that goes against everything you believe in , or criticizing a democrat policy that you broadly agree with , but have minor nitpicks . if all you hear about in the news are democrats criticizing other democrats and giving you reasons to dislike their plans or candidates , what does that do to your likelihood of voting for them ? while i agree with you on most of these points , this sub is called change my view so i do think i can improve upon your view in a substantial way : the american people should be critical of all political representatives when they feel that those people do not represent their constituentcy . the reason i feel this way is that there is already too much tribalism in our politics . to suggest that you need to "" improve upon "" your own political party is also to suggest that you are on a certain team and would be unlikely to change teams , even if another side made a more compelling argument . i am aware of the two party system that dominates our politics and the challenges it poses to this line of thinking . however , i think the only way you ever have moderate candidates again is if people stop apologizing for the people in their party that they do n't like and , instead , only vote for people who truly reflect your own values and beliefs . first , some data from the wikipedia article on political party strength in the u.s. : it tells us that fewer of the people that lean democrat are voting than those who lean republican , and by a large amount . there are a lot of reasons for this , including the fact that old people tend to be more conservative , and also have more free time to vote ( as well as fewer arbitrary political obstacles to voting ) . but all else being equal , given any kind of plausible split among the non-leaning independent voters , if equal percentages of democrats and republicans ( and leaners ) voted , it would have been a landslide for hillary . that hubris was a combination of thinking that the election was "" in the bag "" and therefore not voting , and the hubris of thinking "" i did n't get to vote for bernie , therefore i 'm not going to vote at all "" . i.e. it was the hubris of democrats thinking that they have the luxury of being able to argue among themselves and stay away from the polls when they do n't like the results . very little of it has to do with offending or criticizing republicans . no , the problems with the democratic party are not the right issue to be debating in a situation like this . creating and advancing democratic unity in the face of unity by people that want to elect someone as manifestly unsuited and unqualified to the job as donald trump is the right approach . right-wingers point out the fact that democrats are always cannibalizing themselves , then point to the fact that no republican would dare criticize another as proof that they are virtuous . the centrists , who are too lazy to do the legwork , then look at the options and say "" well , the democratic candidate is always embroiled in some huge controversy and the only people who criticize trump are the left wingers . republicans have dominated the last 10 years of national politics off the back of criticizing democrats . the narrative that democrats are uniquely unbearably condescending is in itself a dismissive criticism originating from the republican side . republicans are intentionally exploiting our ( democrats ) impulse to criticize ourselves and actually hold our own accountable . as someone who is supposed to be republican ( and , honestly , is probably a centrist ) , i think i can say with confidence that , due to the thought you say you 've put into your own position and why you believe what you believe , you 're the type of person that , in the very least i personally would like to change my mind on what i believe and my values in a polite discussion about right-and-wrong and so , so many other things . as for the cmv , i 'm open to have a discussion with people with differing opinions and they do n't belittle my beliefs . i also agree with the "" i may disagree with you , but i 'll defend to my death your right to say it "" mindset . this view is one of the reasons the democrats lose to the republicans so much . republicans fall in line and vote as a block , where as democrats do n't fall in line and vote together as much as the republicans do . instead democrats fight among ourselves and publicly criticize our own candidates . if you 're playing defense , then you ca n't perfect your form . you 're just too busy trying to stay alive and fight for your life . the democrats are constantly playing defense just trying to stay alive and so they have no time to perfect their form and debate the nuances between the various democratic positions . we do that by voting together in a block for democrats - and not getting into public fights and critiquing democrats running for office because they are n't 100 % perfect with our ideals . in my experience , most motivated , voting democrats already do this of their democratic leaders . this most recent election , far-left movements have been even more radical in eating their own young , also a lot of berniecrats very derisive of hillary . the folks who do either die ( e.g. mccain ) or leave the party because they are disgusted by the direction of the party or current leadership ( e.g. jeff flake among other never-trumpers ) . when democrats criticize republicans in the current administration , it made no difference ( kavanaugh ) . when gop criticize other gop members , they either get pushed out ( most of the never-trumpers ) or fall in line ( ted cruz - trump literally called his wife ugly for god sake ) . so , while you could argue both parties should be critical of their own party , there 's an existential assymetry here . i remember how hard liberal folks were on obama at the lapse of public option , and signing ndaa , for example , so it 's not just during times when gop is in power . while you are correct that things would be better if both parties focused more on criticizing their own political party , what we have here is ultimately a form of the classic prisoner 's dilemma . if both sides criticize their own party then we get 2 parties that are better and more qualified to lead the people which is clearly a better option . if both sides just criticize the other party then we get two parties blind to their own faults and prone to corruption which is clearly a worse option . however there is a third option in the prisoner 's dilemma : one side criticizes their opponent and one side criticized themselves . in this case , one party becomes more corrupt and bad while also getting all the power because the other party takes all the flak and all the criticism . to get the optimal outcome in a prisoner dilemma you need to have faith that your fellow prisoner is going to do the right thing . the current republican party has doubled down hard on criticizing their opponents so the democrats know that the other prisoner is definitely going to throw them under the bus . when you know the other prisoner is going to do that , your optimal strategy is no longer "" get the outcome where neither party acts poorly "" because that 's impossible . your optimal strategy is to throw the other prisoner under the bus as well so that you get 10 years in jail instead of them going free and you getting 20 . ie , if politician x says or does something atrocious , i should criticize that . i should n’t have to say “ hmmm , but that atrocious act is by the opposite political party , ” and instead search for something less than atrocious to criticize just because of party lines . if your goal is to create and participate in a political system that serves its citizens as well as possible , then you should criticize both your own party and the opposing one whenever either party does something that you believe does not further the goal of good governance . it stands to reason that you will more often agree with the actions of your own party than with those of the opposing party -- that 's how you ended up in your party to begin with . if i agreed with republicans more often than with democrats , i 'd be a republican . i think what you 're touching on here is that a two-party system that 's as combative as ours is ( and perhaps as all two-party systems eventually become ) is ineffective , because we 're all incentivized to focus more on party loyalty than on good governance . however , if you believe your party 's candidate will serve the country better than their opponent , then criticizing the opponent 's weaknesses or flaws is one of the ways you convince others to vote the way you do , which you want them to do if you believe your candidate is the best one . i very much feel that many of the republican party 's platforms amount to bigotry and discrimination . i am absolutely inclined to challenge the belief that transgender people are unwelcome in public spaces , or that pregnant people surrender their right to bodily autonomy , or that religious beliefs are a valid reason to discriminate against same-sex couples . i do think the democratic party has a lot of issues , and the 2016 election is only the beginning of proof of that . i also think we all need to be willing to hold our own party to a higher standard rather than just trying to tear the other one down . but if we truly believe our party 's position is the better one for the country , then why should n't we advocate for it ? we choose it because we think it 's the better way to govern , and that means there are flaws in the other party 's way . if we want to find the best way to govern , we have to point out flaws in all suggestions so we can fix them . but if i 'm criticizing one party more than the other , why would i be a member of the party i most disagree with ? then go with the party that you have the least to nitpick about . i believe we should distinguish between criticism attacking the subject-matter of politics ( proposals , platforms , positions ) and criticizing attacking the people . i believe it is ok to attack opposing viewpoints and believes , even the fundamental ones . the condescension , exaggeration and ridicule stem from the belief that the opponent is not just wrong , but wrongful and morally corrupt . the attacks we see today from the left upon the right stem from the belief that the right does suffer from a core moral deficiency . where i challenge your view : i believe you take too broad a stance against criticizing opponents / opposing viewpoints generally . i believe that criticizing opposing viewpoints and beliefs is in keeping with the purpose of politics . what matters is whether that criticism has a rational basis in fact , and is part of a good-faith effort answer a genuine political question . by "" genuine political question , "" i mean a question that can be fairly addressed through the political process ( as opposed to questions that can only be addressed through a moral , spiritual or personal process ) . once a party 's politics become moralized , they become personalized , fundamentalist and militant . the party turns its fight to one or more of these abstract forces . the party perceives their opponent to be "" possessed "" by this force , tainting everything flowing from that opponent . this causes the party to largely abandon the political process , which becomes useless in the face of such a threat . i believe the best internal criticism involves confronting these fundamentalist , moralistic approaches . defend against criticisms based on the premise that the opponent is morally corrupt . defend against criticisms that target a broad label or an abstract "" evil . "" by all means , do criticize the other party for bad ideas , or even corrupt ideas . political parties are nothing more than the whole of their parts . when a party comes to be dominated by one of its moral fundamentalist wings , the party adopts and applies that moral code . under a fundamentalist moral code , we do n't distinguish between a viewpoint , and the person holding that viewpoint . if that person is morally corrupt , so is the viewpoint . the party leads with its own moral code , extolling its own moral righteousness while condemning the moral depravity of its opponents . the "" activist "" left has been at that stage for some time , but only recently have they pushed the democratic party as a whole into that stage . the controlling wing of the democratic party has adopted a secular code of morality , centered around personal identity , power and oppression . under this moral code , the party can quickly dispense with opposing ideas by demonstrating that the source of those ideas fails to meet the code . you can see the religious moralism pervades the republican party platform in 1996 . adherence to this religious moral code allowed the christian right to quickly dispense with all manner of society 's ills , from poverty , drugs , crime , unemployment , international disputes and more . alternative solutions and opposing positions were attacked for either failing to address the moral question , or for perpetuating the depravity . we see a similar force pulsing through the democratic party and left-wing politics . by applying their secular moral code , the left has created a unified framework through which it diagnoses each problem as resulting from the moral corruption of their opposition ... from greed , bigotry and hatred . the left 's opponents are n't merely wrong , they are wrongful and morally corrupt , and so are their political products . and by labeling the other group losers , you get to win by default . thus you may not get any of the things you desire as the other group can take power . but if a prominemt party member was vocally against their own party , it can turn people away . i think most people do criticize their own party , especially on the right . the difference is , criticizing your side in front of the other side does n't happen as much . people see admitting the faults of your party as weakness and do n't want to tell people of the other party that they might be right , as politics is just the eternal struggle of pulling people to your side . the reason you see this done more by democrats is because you are one . you are more involved in liberal circles , liberal subs and watch liberal media , intended for liberals . you wo n't hear a conservative guest on cnn criticize the republicans in front of a liberal audience . you will though , hear a liberal podcast criticize democrats because their audience is already on their side . likewise , if you watch a conservative podcast that is n't alex jones , you will hear plenty of criticism of republicans . this system requires that both parties are criticizing and working to improve themselves . if one system is n’t criticizing itself , or is actively retrograding , it is the duty of the other to push that party to become better , would n’t you think ? directly post election i think your proposition makes sense and for people to focus inwardly vs outwardly . however , during a close election does n't it make sense for democrats ( for example ) to be critical of republican policy in a bid to win over swing people who are in the middle ?"
9rbitl,"people in favour of housing refugees , should be required to provide housing for refugees take the case of the central american refugee van headed to the us right now . but this is intended to work for any refugee crisis . -- url -- people who are in favor of taking in those refugees should be placed on a registry to provide housing , food , and social assistance for those aforementioned refugees . taking in migrants has many positive effects on a country , but it comes with just as many costs to society and the government . people who strongly believe that refugees should be admitted should have to put their money where their mouth is . at the end of the day , someone must pay for housing , feeding , educating , and socially acclimating refugees . and it makes sense that the people who most strongly support admitting refugees become a part of the solution . it would be a resource based system . you would n't be expected to house any refugees if you are living in a one-room apartment . you would n't be expected to feed any refugees if you are food insecure . and you would n't be expected to volunteer your time to teach them english if you are working all the hours you can just to stay financially solvent . however , if you are a "" have "" rather than a "" have not "" , and you voted to bring said refugees in . you shall be placed onto this "" refugee assistance registry "" . and if you are asked to do so by the government , you shall have to provide housing , food , financial assistance , or your time as a volunteer to help said refugees adapt to their new country . you shall face fines if you refuse . and the fines paid would be used to pay for the welfare and care of the refugees ( which you probably should not object to since bringing them here was something you adamantly supported ) . think of that fine as an opt-in refugee assistance tax , which is the alternative to providing material support to refugees . because i have had to respond to this many , many times . i would like to make a clarification . i am only proposing this specific method ( referendum - registry ) to assist with the impending refugee crisis as the caravan of 7,200 ( and growing ) refugees near the us border . -- url -- if the us decides to take in the caravan . do you think that there are homes ready and waiting for them ? that caravan is the size of a small american city . these people will need housing , food , healthcare , financial support , and volunteers to teach them english so they can access social services , go to school , and eventually find jobs and work . not all americans agree that these 7,200 should be allowed to bypass the system of legal immigration in place . hence , my proposal is that the americans who are in favor of admittance , who have the resources to do so , should step up and help with actions and not just words if the refugees are admitted as per their wishes .","is this view unique to the issue of refugees or are you broadly in favor of the general principle that people who support x should pay for or provide x ? how about : people who want to keep refugees out of the country should be required to stand at the border and try to keep them out ? or people who want children to be educated should be required to build and fund schools , while everyone else gets to not pay ? the government sets our collective goals , taxes the people to fund those goals , and then uses the tax money to execute on those goals . you pay taxes , and a portion of those taxes are used to pay for the services needed to support refugees . every person who supports a border wall should be on a border wall assistance registry . every person who supports corporate subsidies should be on a corporate subsidy assistance registry . every person who supports gun rights should be on a gun rights assistance registry . every person who supports automotive infrastructure should be on a motor-vehicle assistance registry . i support none of those things , yet my taxes are used ( if i were american ) to prop up each one of them against my will . that 's fine , because that 's how a democracy and taxation works best . for one , just because someone believes that refugees should be given a chance to escape their home circumstances does not mean they necessarily have the ability to contribute to a solution on their own . no matter how strong their conviction , they may not have the skills to teach them a language , or an actual bed for them to sleep on . although you say that those who legitimately can not help will be exempt from your program , in practice , the number of people who actually have this time and resources , and are willing to volunteer them , may not be enough to meet demand . as it exists now , however , the costs of these programs are spread very thing , over many people , so the personal cost of contributing to a refugee program is very low . now , apply the same level personal obligation implied in your refugee program to education policy . if the same person housing this hypothetical refugee also believed that the government should provide after school programs to underprivileged kids , should they also be required to drive a third grader home and teach reading in their time off ? the de-centralized approach is woefully less efficient than simply using a portion of tax revenue to pay a small number of dedicated , qualified professionals to run these program . this is the function of our government , to centralize our labor and resources , to allow us to pursue a diverse set of social priorities with minimal personal effort . by living in this country , you agree to support and contribute to our social priorities , with the understanding that you are better off on the whole for the benefits that this cooperation brings you . if this is your belief , then you everyone not on the registry that supports the immigrants should be placed on a separate registry that forever forbids them from any of the positive benefits that immigrants provide . i think it would be wonderful to have a registry of people who are willing to being refugees into their personal community and even homes . but i do think your view is odd , that if someone approves of some political action they should be compelled to personally engage in it . regarding the current refugee caravan that may or may not arrive in a couple of months , they will be treated the same as any other person coming to the border and individually screened . in that case maybe people could also opt out of paying tax to secure the border at all . maybe recall what the refugee convention is and why the us and the rest of the world entered into it . after sending boats of jews back to germany to be slaughtered , the world agreed that if anyone shows up at your country and can demonstrate she is being persecuted on the grounds of religion , sex , race ... they will be allowed to stay . yrs , i agree those in favour should provide the support . thousands and more donate to help settle refugees and do make their homes open to them . there are ways to sponsor refugees as well who are in camps awaiting countries to take them . do n't you think as the most powerful country and one with enormous wealth you can support people who are fleeing for their lives ?"
9rbdis,"the bomb packages sent to leaders of the democratic party and cnn are a False flag due . this is due to timing and the upcoming midterm elections in the coming weeks . backstory : 2016 i supported clinton all the way to the end . trump won and i decided to support the president . overtime i ended up from lib to conservative but now i stay pretty much down the middle . i ’m always open to the other side and realize that i actually agree/disagree with both parties so i ’m independent now . i ’ll vote for the party that i feel would take care of current issues the best now with midterms coming up it just seems so convenient to depict trump supporters as evil and violent individuals . just the timing is the main factor for me . seems like these leaders were never in any danger at all . the person who sent these knows the devices were n’t going to harm anyone and it was just to draw outrage whoever wins or lose does n’t really make a difference to me . i ’m not as emotionally invested as i was before . that being said , i would never put anything below a politician ( rep or dem ) to try to sway public opinion . it ’s the name of the game and that ’s what is happening here .","the purpose of a False flag attack is to justify consolidation of power to defend against the threat ; you need to have the control of the government in the first place so you can justify imposing greater security to "" protect against threats to the nation "" or whatever . by False flagging while not in power , you only give your opponent the excuse to consolidate power themselves , making it less likely for you to gain it back . it is extremely unlikely , therefore , for democrats to False flag themselves - they have nothing to gain , and a lot to lose . you both have the risk of the bomb actually killing someone and the rest of the conspiracy being discovered , which would basically end the dnc as an organization . and while this may motivate dems to get out and vote , this is a midterm they do n't need widespread support they need to motivate people in very specific districts . though , i do n't really know if it is worth discussing , since you do n't have any actual evidence that supports your view , only an existing bias . that ’s also a potentially politically important event , which clearly works into the narrative of the gop , and the timing of which is “ convenient . ” but it 's quite easy to come up with an explanation for something after the fact . if these packages had been sent two weeks ago you might say that they "" conveniently "" disrupted the kavanuagh hearing . had they been sent two months ago , you might say that they "" conveniently "" fed into facebook 's narrative about alex jones ' ideas and platform being dangerous and were therefore a False flag planned by silicon valley liberals . the packages sent to democrats and cnn did not have cancelled stamps . its very likely a lone wolf who is fed up with the way politics are going is trying to influence the way people vote in the midterms . the timing argument could just as easily work the other way : with the midterms approaching politicians are working hard to campaign for re-election for themselves or other members of their parties . throwing a major party into turmoil by assassinating key members and donors , or even just making them afraid they might be assassinated , would disrupt their efforts and make it harder for them to effectively campaign . the secret service and other security personnel screened the mail and found the bombs before they reached their targets ."
9rb54h,"the concept of gender does not serve a useful purpose and gender theory only serves to promote tribalism . i believe that biological sex is the only sex-based characteristic that should be acknowledged by our society . my understanding of gender theory is that it is , in broad terms , the idea that gender and the concept of manhood or womanhood stems from some kind of social inheritance and that the primary differences between the sexes are the result of an individuals upbringing rather than biological factors . it to me has always seemed like a ridiculous solution to the very real problem of inequality between the sexes . in my opinion , a man or woman should be able to act in whatever way they prefer because of their rights as an individual , not because they are part of some "" special class "" that has a certain set of psychological characteristics inherent to them . worse yet , the idea of gender being a social construct has led many people to Falsely believe that the only biological difference between the sexes is their genitals . the entire reason i 'm here today is because a friend of a friend tried to argue , in all seriousness , that the only reason men are stronger than women is because society pushes them to workout more and do strength training . she absolutely refused to yield on this position even after i pointed out that my single rep max on bench press was higher than the world record for women in my weight class , and that the power lifters competing in these competitions would all be training far more often than me . the more serious ramifications are situations where parents take their personal and highly politicized views on the subject and use it as justification to permanently and drastically alter their children 's development through hormone therapy because they exhibit behavior in line with a certain gender or worse yet , trying to influence the outcome of their gender by insisting on said therapy . at the ages some of these treatments are occurring i was not responsible enough to pick out what clothes i was going to wear , let alone whether or not i should be replacing my hormones . in my mind parents who do this are no different than those parents who send their kid off to gay conversion therapy . it is cruel , and wrong , and setting their children up for self-hatred and depression .","i 'm assuming you believe that sex differences lead to behavioural differences , like hormone levels and such . given that why should n't there be a separate category for behavioural differences , and a looser one at that considering just how much variation there is in the levels of these hormones and brain makeup differences between sex . like if a woman has a lot of testosterone compared to her peers , that could definitely show itself in her behaviour . if those hormonal differences are enough to make that woman feel like a different gender , or between genders to be biologically strict and say that there is nothing there but her genes is kind of the opposite of being biologically sound , your just ignoring the entire side of sexual dimorphism in favour of x and y chromosomes when i first interact with anyone i am respectful and do treat women nicer than men really , just the way i was raised . in any aspect of life i look at , i have n't seen an aspect that gender would really effect . let 's assume first that this is an entirely True phenomemon and additionally , that it is n't a rare scenario played up by media to get attention . even in this world , where parents are doing this , the problem is n't necessarily recognition of non-sexual gender . a parent who would encourage their child to undergo a limb lengthening procedure to increase their ability to perform at the hurdles ( pretend this would work for the sake of argument ) would be similarly frought with controversy . it doesnt mean we should only recognize people for being sedentary or active so as to keep parents from encouraging life changing things before those children reasonably could make that decision . puberty blockers allow identified transgender kids to take a time out to flesh out how they feel about their gender and as of right now the side-effects seem pretty minor . this means that the scenario you lay out is largely non-existant because that gender reassignment can happen at a later , more reasonable time . basically what i am getting at here is that the problems you are highlighting here are not problems that stem from gender theory . they are problems that might lessen or go away if we magically could make all of society only recognize bio-sex genders but that isnt the only way to make those problems disappear and is incredibly unrealistic . i personally had been taught that there was a fundamental difference between sex and gender . one of your main gripes seems to be caused by the confusion between the two , which is partially a result of similar or the same terms being used to describe both - > this is something i can agree with being negative & is something i believe could be possible to eventually change . abolishing the concept of gender altogether is too extreme though , in that i personally ca n’t fathom that outcome ever being accepted . i feel the assertion that gender does n’t serve a useful purpose can be challenged simply on the merit that it ’s currently being used . gender serves a useful purpose insofar as that those who find importance in it enjoy using it & find it to be useful . nothing about biological sex , with the exception of reproduction , has a lot to do with anything that happens in modern society . do people lined up with the category we 've collectively designated as men tend to have better upper body strength ? people lined up with the category we 've collectively designated as women tend to have better balance and flexibilty . a handful of blue collar jobs aside ( which - some evidence shows that when women are given the same opportunities , they produce equitable outcomes , but i 'm not nearly educated enough on it to argue on it ) , there 's not a whole lot of opportunities for the differences in biological sex to amount to anything . tbh it 's impossible to figure out what is nature and what is nurture when it comes to gender , because gender as a total binary ( as in two completely separate , non-overlapping categories ) straight up does not exist ( you can not strictly define womanhood or manhood . there are no universal and separate experiences dividing the two , there is always examples of overlap in every single individual ) and even biological sex as a total binary is often murky ( sexual dimorphism in humans is like so thin that we rely on a bunch of external signals to tell us ) . honestly i 'd argue that while the concept of gender is important on an individual level , our cultural obsession with the gender binary is so , so , so harmful . kids should be able to explore gender in their own time , in their own way . if you believe that gender does n't serve a useful purpose , i do n't think it lines up logically to simultaneously believe that kids should n't be allowed to explore it . on the contrary , the concept gender does serve a very useful descriptive purpose . obviously , not every woman embodies all womanlike behaviors and not every man embodies all manlike behaviors . the concepts of what men and women are like have become concepts of how men and women should be . a descriptivist view solves this problem without having to completely abandon the concept of gender . on a descriptivist view , a biological male can be seen as a woman ( and vice versa ) without any real conflict between sex and gender . i think there is still a question of intent , but it seems very clear that the reason trans people adopt a new gender is because they have a feeling of identity that better matches the description of a gender that is n't typically associated with their sex . which brings me to the association of sex and gender . according to my understanding , gender is not scientifically considered to be a sex characteristic at all , but it is often considered to be a sex characteristic by laypeople . that is , people seem to believe that sex causes gender . in fact , sex and gender actually have a high positive correlation . that is , if you are male , you are highly likely to have a masculine gender identity and if you are female , you are highly likely to have a feminine gender identity . so yeah , sex really is the primary/only sex based characteristic we need to acknowledge , but because gender is n't really a sex based characteristic in the first place . yeah , but that does n't mean gender is n't a social construct . and it does n't mean that gender needs to be abandoned , at least in descriptivist terms . but instead of discarding gender as a construct , we need to push for a more refined understanding of it and its relationship to sex . one would hope that parents have enough empathy and general common sense to wait until they can be sure their kids have a fully coalesced sense of gender identity before approaching the question of gender reassignment . there is at least some evidence that children have a sense of their gender identity as young as 3 to 5 years of age . i think that the best approach is probably to accept the child 's identified gender without rushing to make solid plans about medical procedures . in sum , i think we do n't need to abandon gender as a concept or social construct , but instead reformulate it in descriptivist terms . in support of that , we need better education on the nuances of sex , sex based characteristics , and gender . i do n’t really see how getting rid of gender identity will solve or improve anything . you ’d still be categorizing people , just based biological sex . but biological sex is complicated as well since intersex people exist . tribalism is going to exist whether we have gender identity or not . i guess i do n’t really accept that the idea that gender identity is the root cause of these issues . it ’s closed mindedness , lack of education , lack of empathy or compassion . i guess my main points are that gender identity is n’t inherently bad and even if it is , getting rid of is n’t necessarily the best solution . getting rid of gender identity is n’t going to get rid of stupidity . ookay so like , biological sex is n't actually a real thing . there 's no consensus om the definition of this concept and certainly no binary of sex . apparently about 1.7 percent of the world is intersex , and if you consider the vast number of trans people and the cultural differences between gender roles , you are likely to see that "" sex "" does n't really define behavior the way people tend to think . if you look at the ways men and women are similar to their own group but different from the other group , you can see how so many of those common group characteristics are defined by social ideas about gender rather than sexual dimorphism . gender is a huge part of our society , people face incredible pressure to conform to gender norms , perceived gender shapes the way children are treated from their earliest years . i do n't really know what tribalism is supposed to mean , but as far as i know gender theory is a field of study . the biological sex of a person does n't tell you as much about who they are as person as their innate gender identity does . their gender identity is based on their brain structure , because transgender people evidently have brains like the opposite sex . additionally transgender people are n't the only ones that experience gender dysphoria . if you take a newborn child , give it a sex change and raise it as the opposite sex it will also develop severe gender dysphoria . when it comes to society your brain is simply more important than your genitals , because people can perceive your figurative soul , but they rarely ever see see your genitals or chromosomes . there is a lot of confusion because people often hear "" gender is a social construct "" without understanding the context . gender is a social construct , but that 's simply the definition of gender in the sex and gender distinction . gender is a social construct , because it refers to societal ideas . your gender is your role in society ( man or woman ) and the associated expectations ( masculinity and femininity ) . if something is biological it 's a sex difference or a sex role , but if something is cultural it 's a gender difference or gender role . for example in my gender studies course we learned that toy preferences in children are a sex difference , but not a gender difference because they hold True across cultures and even for primates : females of most species additionally play with dolls that resemble babies because they have a more intense baby-nurturing instinct due to the fact that they will most likely give birth themselves . the treatment are puberty blockers , so that they can make this decision much later in life . they do not get the hormones of the other sex right away . kids that get send to gay therapy end up much worse . transgender kids that get forced to act cis have a really high suicide rate and lots of mental health issues , but those that can socially transition and also know that they can go trough the other puberty later in life experience drastic mental health improvements and dramatic reductions in suicidal intentions . it 's the exact opposite . those that force their transgender kids to live as their birth sex are exactly like those that send them to gay therapy . both think that their kid is unnatural and try to force it to be exactly like the bible says , even though reality is much more complex than the story of the garden of eden . the concept of gender does not serve a useful purpose at all . gender , however , is a societal construct that defines one 's role in society based upon the external representation of their genitalia . furthermore , i would like to point out that you have completely ignored the millions upon millions of intersex persons who have biological traits that "" cross boundaries "" between the classical/stereotypical definitions of male and female . let me put it this way : i would argue that , using your logic , if we are to ignore gender as a concept , then we should also ignore biological sex too . in other words , if you are to be consistent with your version of “ letting people be themselves ” , you should also advocate ignoring biological sex . the make up for a person ’s sex chromosomes does not always line up with the activity of their various genes that influence sex traits , with their sex organs , with the balances of their various hormones , with their secondary sex characteristics , and with many of the other myriad traits linked to biological sex . in fact , people can be composed of cells of varying sexes , whether that sex be defined chromosomally , genetically , or hormonally . do these facts about the messiness of biological sex lead us to abandon it in favor of just letting “ people be people ” ? however , we should remember that alongside our utter uniqueness stands our great similarities with others , similarities that are not only real and useful , but also so powerful they define who we are and how we see ourselves . so while biological sex is messy , we can not ignore that it exists and that it is a complex landscape centered around the strange attractors that are maleness and femaleness . the same goes for gender , except that gender exist at a higher layer of complexity - more psychological and social rather than merely biological . this is not to say that gender does not have a biological basis , but only that gender rests on a rung higher in the ladder of complexity that stretches from subatomic particles to social superstructures . but we can not deny that despite their uniqueness , people have a biological sex ( albeit it might be a complex one ) . your argument or position is a perfect example of how the political correctness has contributed to the acceptance of theories and views that are completely ignorant and contrary to science . there is a plethora of scientific evidence that gender has distinct biological basis that is separate from sex . the only reason i can see for your view here seems to be that you think it would be less confusing to people like your friend who badly misunderstands the biological differences between the sexes . i would argue that your friend would be confused regardless and failing to acknowledge gender as a distinct and separate force in some people ’s lives would n’t help that at all . "" a friend of a friend tried to argue , in all seriousness , that the only reason men are stronger than women is because society pushes them to workout more and do strength training "" "" the more serious ramifications are situations where parents take their personal and highly politicized views on the subject and use it as justification to permanently and drastically alter their children 's development through hormone therapy because they exhibit behavior in line with a certain gender or worse yet , trying to influence the outcome of their gender by insisting on said therapy . in my mind parents who do this are no different than those parents who send their kid off to gay conversion therapy . it is cruel , and wrong , and setting their children up for self-hatred and depression . "" \ - i 'm not arguing here , just pointing out : virtually most of the time , the parents want the best for their kiddo . the idea that there are only 2 genders simply does not line up with human experience ( including on biological levels such as hormone production ) . trans children very rarely , if ever , are given hormone replacement therapy . those that do are under close supervision of a medical professional that has made that decision in conjunction with the child and the parents . more likely , the child , at puberty , will be given puberty blockers , which , while it still has some side effects , can often be stopped and their natal puberty can resume like normal . this idea you 're presenting is a strawman that is used by anti-trans advocates to discredit hormone therapy and it 's incredibly harmful . if someone who identifies as a male , but was born biologically as a female ( breasts vagina etc ) was to go missing , and many months later their body was found from a heinous crime . the coroner is going to see the remains and find that the bones are likely from a female around age yada yada . assuming no teeth are found , it would be extremely difficult to link the remains to the missing person if the loved ones tell the authorities that their loved one was a male , but did n't clarify he was born a female . people should understand that you could identify however you please , but are biologically the correct sex . i do n't believe that gender is entirely a social construct , but i think a surprising amount of it is . there a different biological attributes that males and females have besides their reproductive system , i believe the proper definition of gender is the differing male/female biological traits aside from the reproductive system . from your op , you sound like you believe gender theory causes people to act one way or another . gender theory is the idea that society puts people in boxes . obviously , there is a biological link , yet society does influence . so this idea that the gender theory is causing the tribalism is like claiming the cancer diagnosis caused the cancer . however , i can see her point because women are often told not to lift heavy . and as a result , many women will never max out their potential like many men do . the idea behind modern gender theory is that gender is rooted in identity . unlike what most people think , gender identity does n't refer to simply stereotypes . actually , modern gender theory is not only not reinforcing gender stereotypes , it is abolishing them . most trans people who want hrt , they felt that , just stronger , going through puberty . really , parents do n't brainwash their kids to taking hrt because they "" wanted a [ insert gender here ] "" , or because of their political views ( there seems to be this myth , that the affirmative approach to therapy for transgender youth is basically just to convince/pressure the kid into medically transitioning , when it 's actually about giving the child a place to explore themselves , and not treating their transness as a flaw that must be fixed . the only times their highly political views accually force hormones on their children , is when they deny the child access to hrt . because most people who want hrt , they want it because they are experiencing physical gender dysphoria . physical gender dysphoria is defined as a dislike of certain sex characteristics , which can lead to distress , anxiety , depression , and more ( note that i 've said most because some people get hrt because it makes them feel better , even if not getting it does n't make them feel bad ) . now , most sex characteristics appear after puberty ( they 're called secondary sex characteristics ) . and to your fear that the little children getting hrt are too young to know and might regret it : they are n't and they wo n't . what pre-pubescent kids who get hrt receive is hormone blockers , whose purpose is to let the child make the decision of whether or not to replace hormones later . your situation was unfortunate that a friend of a friend believes that there is n’t a physical aspect tied to gender but i believe that as a society , we ’re still in the process of having a meaningful debate about gender theory and it ’s history . i ’m sure that she ’s not the only one who throws away the biological sex baby with the gender bathwater but you at least tried to give a reasonable explanation based on your workouts . in my opinion the gender theory does cause tribalism , but that 's not bad if you respect other "" tribes "" . do you think different cultures at different points in history have had different conceptions of what femininity and masculinity are ? only women can have kids , and therefore women are going to have to take time off work to physically give birth and are going to end up spending more time with a newborn child than a father will . the father can obviously choose to take paternity leave , and frequently will , however it is n't a choice for the mother , they have to take the leave . combining that with breastfeeding time ( which i guess is optional , but is fairly universally recommended ) , mothers are naturally going to form stronger bonds with young children than fathers will . therefore there 's already a distinguishable difference between mother and father . the second reason is that our biological differences go further than us just having a different set of reproductive organs . granted , i 'm a 21 year old cisgender male who does n't at all represent those who have gender identities that do n't conform to their biological sex . the social landscape assigns attributes , wants , expectations , etc. to these two kinds of people based on the name given to them , as determine by their biology . are we to assume we 've already uncovered the deepest aspects of what constitutes humanity and , therefore , this person is just wrong ? is n't the problem , fundamentally , that we are attempting to separate complex individuals into easily defined boxes in the first place ? sounds to me like you should be a big supporter of gender theory . there are distinct behavior and presentation differences between the genders . because those behavior and presentation differences are real and those are what you use to make judgements about someone 's sex when you ca n't see their crotch . the position from the right is that trans people should n't exist and therefore should be treated like crap . there are undeniable biological differences between everybody , a major factor being sex . i often find myself replying to my daughter that she can play with whatever toy she wants/dress however she wants and everybody else can do the same regardless of sex . she knows there are differences between sexes i think her and her friends are trying to work them out and the level they think at is toys/clothing which is sometimes reinforced by parents . this all sounds quite hippy until you remember my first statement about undeniable biological differences between sexes . the whole problem is people constantly confuse sex and gender you ’re not using the words “ sex , ” “ gender , ” or “ social construct ” in the same way that gender theory does . “ sex ” is used to refer exclusively to biology — what set of sex organs do you have , what secondary sex characteristics do you have , etc . the two terms are often used interchangeably in day to day life , but they ’re not interchangeable in gender theory at all . that ’s all learned behavior — your whole early life is learning , without even realizing it , how you ’re supposed to act based on whether you ’re labeled as a boy or a girl at birth . and the lessons are merciless — the boy who plays with barbie dolls in front of his friends is going to be teased relentlessly , and likewise for girls who prefer “ boy ” activities . in this way , we internalize these rules that really make no sense , and we ’re strongly discouraged from breaking them by a huge amount of social pressure . that ’s what “ social construct ” means here — they ’re rules that we as a society made up at some point in the past , and which we ’ve so internalized that we forget it ’s all arbitrary . the statement “ gender is a social construct ” does n’t mean “ there are absolutely no biological differences between people we call male and people we call female ” ; rather , it ’s more like “ the rules about behavior are made up by society and have nothing inherently to do with biological sex . ” this actually ends up supporting your position in favor of individual liberties : the logic of gender theory says that since gender roles are socially constructed , there ’s no reason individuals should be forced to follow them . if you do n’t feel comfortable with the label “ man ” or “ woman ” , no problem , they ’re social constructs anyway . are you suggesting that we live in a "" genderless "" society , where there is no "" he "" and no "" she "" ( in english ) , and everything is just "" they "" ( or "" ze "" or something similar ) , and people just act however they want ? meaning , there would be no reason to distinguish a man from a woman , or a more masculine female from a more feminine male , because it would n't come up in everyday conversation . gender and sex should be synonymous , and everyone should act however they want to act . you say it is the concept of gender theory that is encouraging tribalism . gender theory merely provides names for the marginalized to rally around . but it was not long ago that homosexuality , transgenderism , or merely failing to display certain signals of masculinity was pretty well universally considered grounds for anything from ostracism ( at best ) by one 's peers , to blacklisting from employment , to being beaten to death by a gang of young men in an alley . the popular embrace of gender theory is not the cause of the tribalism of which you speak , but the effect . if i understand it correctly , you 're asserting that gender labels should n't exist and/or only the concept of male and female should exist ? so , in regards to your last paragraph , do you really think the fact that some kid or parent has a specialized label to use has any noticeable effect on whether or not the kid undergoes hormone therapy ? we know that hormones affect behavioral and cognitive characteristics in a lot of ways , and we know that men and women have different hormonal profiles . so what 's the evidence for believing that "" biological factors "" are not responsible for "" the primary differences between the sexes "" ? it 's undeniably a real , medical phenomena that experts have been chronicling and treating for a very long time . before modern medicine , and in societies where the western conception of gender roles was not strictly enforced by violence or law the phenomena of people feeling incongruous with their assigned sex at birth was common , and is still to this day . to say that there is nothing to gender theory is to spit in the face of a century of medical science and thousands of years of human culture . parents can not unilaterally get their children on hormone therapy . there are very strict medical standards for diagnosis , and the hormone blockers ( not permanent , or drastic , ) are prescribed by a medical professional after evaluating a child and determining that they have a medical condition for which that prescription is the treatment . do you have an equally large problem with the significantly more common issue where parents take there personal and highly politicized views of gender roles and raise their daughters to be feminine and their sons to be masculine according to tradition and stereotype ? and at the age where you were n't responsible enough to pick up your clothes , no one is giving those children the choice to replace their hormones . they 're taken to a doctor who evaluates them for a medical condition , which if they have it is treated . would you say that a child should n't be able to take asthma medication because they 're not old enough to make the choice that they suffer from asthma and need to treat it ? it sounds as though you think 5 year olds are going to the hormone candy store . parents who take their child to a doctor and give their child medication prescribed by their doctor are no different than parents who send their children away to be tortured by psychopaths because they do n't like who their kid is holding hands with ? i mean , that 's a much more silly belief than your acquaintance has about strength in men and women . \ > the more serious ramifications are situations where parents take their personal and highly politicized views on the subject and use it as justification to permanently and drastically alter their children 's development through hormone therapy because they exhibit behavior in line with a certain gender or worse yet , trying to influence the outcome of their gender by insisting on said therapy ... . it is cruel , and wrong , and setting their children up for self-hatred and depression . no sane parent is going to make their child trans or gay , and no doctor would help them if they were insane . hormone treatments are very beneficial to delay puberty to allow the child with gender identity disorder to make a choice when they are older . the goal of most trans people is to pass as their chosen gender , and preventing puberty from making the ' wrong ' changes in their bodies will save them a not insignificant amount of suffering . case in point : it is "" common "" with lesbian transgender women . for those individuals , it would have been far easier to stay male ( both avoiding sex correction and better possibilities to find a partner ) if gender was a choice . these people obviously feel trapped in the wrong sex and those not offered sex correction and respect/understanding are at risk of becoming suicidal . the interesting medical ethical discussion that could be made is : if we gain the ability to change gender identity ( with brain surgery , drugs or something else ) - should we then aim for gender correction or sex correction ? nobody ( sane ) would undergo sex correction if being transgender was n't a real thing . but you also say that people should be able to live however they feel . so would i be right in saying that you believe people should happily live , say , transgender-type lifestyles , only without identifying as a specific gender ? so instead of a sexually male person identifying with a female gender - therefore being transgender - that person should instead accept and identify with their male sex while continuing to live with a feminine lifestyle and appearance like they would have if they were transgender ? there is your sex , thats it , its the only thing that should be defined in some way due the need for medical treatment . and this should be femal , male and a term for anything besides this , so everytime it gets important , a look on the personal pass makes sure , as long as you arent "" male "" or "" female "" in a biological way , they should pay more attention about whatever this is connected to it , but sure only for anything that belongs to a need to clarify whats up with your sex . at first , the human is an individual , not male , female , black , asian , white or whatever stereotype you are able to think . for myself : as long we as society still dance around male or female , or maybe in the future around gender like cisgender , transgender whatever , still we put people in stereotypes and do not look them as individual , i wouldnt call that progress . the purpose is examining the points where where biological sex ends and societal pressure begins for the purpose of dismantling and eliminating the cultural memes that comprise gender . if they stop taking them , they will simply go through puberty late . for those that are genuinely transgender , stopping puberty will make it easier for them to physically transition genders . note that no one , adult or child , gets puberty blockers or hormones right away , and they definitely wo n't get them because their parents said they need them or because they are a boy who is kinda girly . assigning gender purely as biological sex is nothing but transphobia . if we did n't , then we 'd live in a society without the concept of race , which is bad for some reason i will never explain . ' there are parents that force their children to get tans at tanning booths , i wo n't aknowledge the sheer majority of cases where the child wants it , but just make it sound like all minors who have their bodies altered are having it done against"

9r6dv5,"those who transistion their gender are directly supporting toxic patriarchal gender roles i 'm not transphobic by any means , but i 've been feeling lately that once one decides to transition , they 're doing so because they feel that they identify more with the gender that they were n't assigned with at birth . but my belief is that gender ( not biological sex ) differences are purely social . so therefore , transitioning is perpetuating the societal differences between men and woman , which are often very toxic . i.e. that men are physically strong and lack in emotion and that women are emotional and feeble .","it hurt me to my core having a male body , and it hurt me just as much when people referred to and thought of me as a man , or boy as it were . i was wearing a suit , looking at myself in the mirror as my mom commented along the lines of "" that 's my boy "" , at which point i broke down and cried like an idiot for minutes , just absolutely devastated over seemingly nothing . some kid breaks down over wearing a suit , later transitions , theory holds . the suit only mattered in the sense that i was being made to put it on because i was supposedly a boy , a male , a manly man in the making , and that perception was what was hurting . nothing about my transition is about relating to women 's gender roles . being trans adds an extra layer to it , because other people who know about it sometimes use a lack of adherence to gender roles to question and invalidate your transition , often pressuring trans people into adhering for the sake of acceptance or even just to receive medical help . thankfully my family and environment do n't do that and are generally quite fantastic , so i 'm free to break gender roles ( again , as a woman ) as much as i like . i 'm not transgender , but from what i 've heard of trans people explaining their experiences , what makes trans people want to transition is not really as much about gender expression or identity as the term ' transgender ' implies . of course it 's a part of it , as much as anything is connected in a physical and mental sense , but trans people do n't tend to transition because they want to start being emotional or physically strong . trans people transition because of a strong and visceral discomfort with their physical body . it 's not about gender in the sense of gender roles or stereotypes . for me as a cis woman , i am happy to embrace my masculine traits or try to change the perception that i am feeble because i also have very feminine traits . i can play around with my gender expression and try breaking stereotypes . but at the end of the day , i feel comfort or even some sense of love for being in a female body . the idea of waking up with no breasts and a penis one day makes me very uncomfortable even though i 'd be happy to play with my gender expression or call out people for stereotyping . because it 's not about gender , it 's a physical comfort with my body . you might have been assigned female at birth , but it 's not just a desire to embrace masculinity that would make them a trans man ( there are plenty of ' butch ' and androgynous women to prove that you can embrace masculine aspects without transitioning ) . it 's the discomfort i would feel if i suddenly had a penis one day . at the end of the day , i think people share your view because the term ' transgender ' as well as all the new conversations we are having about gender and identity make people think transitioning and being transgender is solely about gender expression or wanting to fulfill a certain gender role . but really , focusing on the word ' gender ' in transgender ignores that transition and the dysphoria that go into being trans is a very physical experience related to your body and how you perceive it . there is a separate process to gender the brain in foetal development , this and a few other factors we know about indicate that while the differences are n't as obvious or significant in the body , the brain is affected by what we call for the sake of ease , gender , not necessarily the bodies either . there are real gender norms that influence not just our bodies but also our brains . this is n't the belief of trans people , otherwise they would n't transition . trans people do n't transition to "" reinforce gender roles "" , they do it because they 're very uncomfortable with their bodies and ca n't deal with it anymore . the goal of their transition is to be able to live as the correct sex . while most of them do adhere to the gender role of the sex they transitioned to this is either to help them pass or because ... they 're adhering to the gender role of their sex same as everyone else . or aydian dowling . clearly their transitions have not been purely social and they are n't reinforcing any particular gender roles per se ."
9r6cz1,there should n't be a death penalty for any crime but there should be a death option . for any sentence that 's life or equivalent the person sentenced should be able to choose to be put to death instead . first the death penalty itself runs into several issues most notably of which the fact society has put many innocent people to death . but sentencing someone to life does n't really resolve that issue either . now we 're just making people languish in jail for their entire life unless theyre able to show they 're innocent which is hella difficult . by having a death option you allow people are innocent to make their own choice regarding their life . if they believe they still have a fighting chance to prove their innocence they can do it . if they feel otherwise ? well then there 's no point in making them suffer ( clearly i support euthanasia in other circumstances too ) if they 're guilty ? well what does putting them to death and/or jailing them solve ? it gets them out of society . which giving them the choice to choose does n't eliminate . so what arguement remains ? they deserve to suffer/be punished . first from a societal stand point that 's messed up . torturing people by keeping them locked in a cell does n't make anyone 's life better . we are clearly arent trying to retribute them if they 're in there for life or being killed ( i 'd argue here in america we are n't trying to retribute them regardless but that 's a flaw of the system ) . so then what remains is making the victim/victim 's family feel better . but a ) the judical system does n't care that much about them . and if we truly did ( which i 'm not saying we should n't ) then we should be providing therapy . not caring if they 'd prefer the perpetrator dead or alive . and b ) even though i led this section off with the presumption of guilt . we do n't know that . what if we put them down and then find out they 're innocent do you really think the family would feel good about that ? and finally c ) retributivist arguments about criminal punishment are complete bullshit outside of people abusing positions of power . we should either be removing them or rehabilitating them .,"you could argue that most people could just ensure their own deaths at the scene of the crime - e.g. the columbine shooters just killed themselves after they carried out their shooting . however , suicide attempts often go wrong , we can presume many would be criminals would be aware of this . e.g. if someone 's son or daughter is also waiting to be sentenced for something , the prosecutor can currently already use this against the defendant , e.g. "" if you plead guilty to the full crime you are charged with , we 'll let your son off with only two years ; otherwise he 's going to be locked up for ten . "" could the prosecutor now also suggest : "" if you opt for the death option , we 'll let your son off with only two years "" ? while we want rehabilitation there also has to be an aspect of punishment , this would remove that , we need to use the stick as well as the carrot , not either/or . i remember the case of canadian colonel russell williams who got sentenced to life after raping and murdering multiple women - he was caught attempting suicide and the staff immediately saved him . everyone literally has the option to end their life at any point in time . i do n't see a compelling reason to create a complicated system that 's plenty open to abuse that wo n't amount to much more than state sponsored killing ."
9r67hu,"there is no position against universal health care that is n't a result of miseducation or immorality . every argument i have heard against bringing universal health care to the us ( though this could apply to any other country that does n't have it or is arguing to get rid of it ) is either one of immoral , miseducated or poorly thought out or a combination of them . i address the three biggest reasons that come up i know there are more 1 . higher taxes . 1 ) you 're suggestting that you paying a higher tax is worth someone else 's life . 2 ) you 're going to pay less in your taxes then you do for your insurance as noted by the fact the us pays way more for medical care than anyone else . 2 . i do n't want to pay for someone else because of ... ( there 's a ton of reasons ) well you already are . that is called insurance . 3 . longer wait times . most countries have as short or shorter wait times for most procedures some have longer but regardless of all of that that 's a problem of supply and demand . if we as a society can not create enough doctors we need to address that . but wanting a shorter wait time at the cost of people dying ?","you have to qualify for it , show serious need and financial distress to get it . our current system does more research , creates new medical papers , creates new drugs , new techniques , new technology faster and cheaper than any other nation . do you think it would be a moral / informed position to direct aggregate healthcare spending toward spending the life of one individual ? if i have to spend money to take care of other people , i would rather pay for $ 1 for a vaccine so an ethiopian child can live for an extra 65 years than pay $ 10,000 for universal healthcare so a 75 year old american can live to be 80 . you make a bet your insurer that you will get cancer - you get sick , you win , you stay healthy , they win . you make the bet at disadvantageous odds , but if you win , you win big ( yay cancer ) . crucially , the cost of your insurance is based on your individual risk exposure . ^ 1 this is what differentiates it from a cost-sharing scheme : my health insurance does not increase because someone else smokes . insurance is no more a form of cost sharing than the lottery is , and you can no more support uhc by comparing it to insurance than you can ubi by comparing it to roulette . there are some distortions surrounding the health insurance market specifically , but objectors to universal health care probably also object to those distortions . do you know enough to refute the argument that a free market health care system would be more efficient at lowering costs ? now that being said , i believe there are other valid models which would achieve the same or better results , which do not include universal healthcare . say a government would start to run it 's own healthcare program ( not universal healthcare ) , which would set a minimum acceptable price for doctors , and drugs . the problem with us politics is that everything get distilled into few talking points . so you 're saying that there actually is a reason not to support health care , and that is because our system is not equipped for it without education reform . if the money people were putting into healthcare went straight to taxes and everyone had to pay you would be right that it would be less . however , the reality is that the richest people ’s taxes are probably going to increase more than their current healthcare costs in order to subsidize those who previously could n’t afford healthcare . this means that instead of the cost being fairly divided across everyone who wants healthcare , the rich carry the brunt of the cost for everyone else . whether this is worth it for the common good is still up for debate , but paying less in taxes definitely will not be True across the board . the price i pay for insurance is based on my risk level , which i can control by exercising and eating healthy . if you divorce the cost of insurance from the riskiness of the insuree , you open up moral hazard , where people do n't take care of themselves because somebody else will bear the cost . it 's not even about forced taxes or long lines . now , let 's agree that the current us healthcare system is n't even close to being real capitalism , with locked formulas , lack of competition , forced taxes , mandated insurances , and a slew of other authoritarian principles . that makes companies work towards creating products and services that are the most helpful to people . if the maker of a drug drives the prices through the roof , someone else can make it cheap and they 'll get the customers as long as it is comparable . government paid workers on fixed incomes are n't necessarily going to go out of the way to come up with new and better solutions . i am all for having emergency options offered by the government for dire circumstances , but the vast majority of the healthcare market needs to remain strongly in the free market , for our own sake . i 'm just going to assume that you do n't trust the current administration to properly manage the environment . you will find people are opposed to universal healthcare on philosophical grounds . the difference starts with the lens you look through and varies between individual responsibility and collective responsibility . one party/group ( rnc ) view this issue through the lens of individual responsibility and placing the burden on the individual , not government to manage the healthcare needs of the individual . the other group/party views this through the lens of communal obligations and does not understand why people do not see this need and want it fixed . judging by your post , i am guessing you see this issue through the lens of a communal obligation you believe the us government has . so long as you maintain that underlying assumption , you will never understand the rnc positions . you have to step out of that viewpoint and consider the case where the responsibility lies entirely on the individual and the government has no obligation to the individual . once you do this , you will understand the positions and reasons put forth and how they fit in the overall worldview . after all , not everyone agrees that the us government has an obligation to provide healthcare to everyone . it 's completely valid to not want higher taxes , even if people will die as a result . a government is , essentially , a monopoly on violence , i.e. it is the sole entity empowered to commit violence , and maintains this status quo using violence . taxation is the process by which a government takes wealth from citizens under the threat of violence . if you accept these propositions , it becomes a lot more difficult to justify taxation for any given purpose . i happen to believe that some amount of taxation and coercion by the state are inevitable , because a state without some form of taxation can not maintain its monopoly on violence and will be overthrown . however , it seems to me that expanding the government beyond its role as a "" night watchman "" must be done with the absolute utmost consideration and discretion , because ultimately that entails increasing the degree of coercion experienced by a given citizen . is it right to use the threat of violence against one person to force them to pay , so another person may live ? i do not trust congress to administer healthcare in a fair and efficient way . i think political corruption is the driving force behind the system being as bad as it currently is -- for instance healthcare is the most lobbied sector in the entire economy -- and allowing congress to take control of it fully will only further calcify the problem . i want to focus on the 3 points you brought up and change your mind about them . universal healthcare will lower costs and you will pay lower taxes . turns out , it 's way more expensive to treat someone in an emergency room than to give them regular preventative treatments . insurance is n't how you pay for this , you pay for it because emergency rooms ca n't let people die . wait times in other countries are even lower than in the us . switzerland , germany , netherlands , france , sweden , all have lower wait times than the us ! universal healthcare means lower taxes , fewer costs for everyone , and shorter wait times . what 's important is that the government can negotiate these costs and can set a price ceiling by having its own plan . there 's a us disease which seems to say that as long as you give money to private entities that 's fine , if the government ever negotiates prices then it 's intervention . i ’ll taken one of the issues with your post , the concept that the us as a whole will save money by switching to a universal healthcare system . over 55 % of the population of the us has health insurance through state or federal government . these programs and how cms behaves as a whole is a good example of what a single payer would look like if instantiated . those covered include anyone who is remotely considered poor , disabled , elderly , or a child from a poor family . this covers quite a lot of moral ground here , generally leaving middle class , able bodied , working aged folks as those who are left on the private insurance market . if you want insurance , it is pretty straightforward to find a full time job with at least some benefits , especially when the job market is thriving as it is today and any company over 49 employees must legal offer benefits . the primary reason single payer ( sp ) would not necessary save the us money is because of evidence in the current claims pricing system . cms , the largest payer in the world , has relatively fixed prices based on procedure codes . i do n’t know if you understand insurance claim specifics , but when a claim is made to any payer , it contains a short list of procedure codes that describe what the provider did to the patients as well as a short list of diagnosis codes describing the conditions that patient had at the time of visit . each procedure as a price that is then adjusted by risk models based on diagnosis codes listed on the claim and other past information about the patient ( demographics , geolocation , prior diagnosis , ect ... ) . as a result , in order to understand pricing of insurance , it helps to look at average costs of procedures by procedure codes . there ’s tens of thousands of both types of code that covers everything pretty well . currently , cms pays 80-90 % below the cost of care for each procedure . yes , that means providers actually lose money when they treat people covered by the government . in addition , private insurance pays 120-140 % of the cost of care to providers . because providers need to break even and make some earnings to pay their employees and keep the lights on . in addition , there has been a theme over the last few decades of increasing the number of people on government insurance every year . because of this , private insurance has had to pay more and more in order to cover the difference for the providers and that causes increases in insurance costs for employers and individuals . and there is clear relationship with the percent of the population that is covered by government and increases in private insurance costs . so sure , if you look at it from an individual subjective perspective , it costs less to pay for one government insured folk than one private insured folk , but if sp is created , all those private insurers go away and where does the money come from to make sure provides can keep afloat ? so it ’s a nice thought to cover everyone without question , and it feels good to cover really poor people , children , and the elderly . but jumping from that to over half the population has a massive effect on the insurance claims systems . i ’m talking massive closures of hospitals , lower and lower incentives for folks to go through med school with all that debt , massive unemployment in nursing or any medical profession , significantly worse care , ect . it 's very close to ending certain kinda of cancers and it 's quite possible we will see several cures crop up in the next decades unless universal health care is established ."
9r4p24,"someone like trump could n't happen in the democratic party my position is that someone with trump 's traits and characteristics - malignant narcissism , blatant lying , credible sexual assault allegations against him , a lifetime of fraud and corruption , etc. - could never rise to prominence in the democratic party as currently constituted . put another way , today 's republican party is a uniquely fertile ground for a fraudulent charlatan with authoritarian tendencies to rise to power . it could n't happen in the democratic party - a trump-like figured would n't have won a single democratic primary , let alone captured the nomination and the presidency . to clarify , i 'm only talking about the democratic party as it exists today - not some hypothetical future democratic party ( or the democratic party of the 1860s ) . change my view !","the democratic party is far from a shining beacon of honesty and integrity . he gets credit for an economy that generation x built . and he persisted to push the war on drugs ( aka the war on poor / black communities ) . people who share some of those characteristics with trump have "" happened "" in the democratic party . the difference is that when those people transgress or their transgressions come to light , the party generally deals with them accordingly . reframe it so that it 's not about how trumps traits are absent and could n't happen , but is about how the democratic party reacts when they do . in other words , you are saying specific things that trump has done , but instead you should pointing to generalities that trump exhibits that would change your mind . what are the specific reasons you believe the modern gop to be a ' fertile ground ' for producing a politician like trump ? very simply , the method the democratic party has for determining their supported candidates would 've screwed him out of them . and do we recall why bernie was unable to get the democratic nomination ? not because he lost the support of the voters , but because he did n't have the support of those that acted for the party . the only thing missing is the "" lifetime "" of fraud and corruption , which i 'm not sure trump has . however , that is not to say that someone who has many of the same traits can not be part of the dp , but they would have to be much more subtle and corporate about it . the upper ranks of the democratic party consists largely of corporate types who have made a long career of double-speak , including lying , cheating , being ego driven and narccisitic , etc . i agree that democrats would oppose lying at the same rate as trump but it 's possible a more successful liar could fool democratic voters ."
9r2y3w,"fetus are humans . abortion is still okay . this is a two part viewpoint . let 's start with my first statement . i believe that a fetus are and should be ( with exceptions ) the moral equivalent of a human . that is because , regardless of its capabilities to feel pain , developments , ability to retain memories etc , it has a high ( 70 % of no miscarriage ) chance of becoming what we can universally accept to be a human . as a comparison , lets think about people who fall into a "" brain death state "" after an accident . in a medical sense , this person 's brain function is depressed , incapable of many bodily functions , unable to retain memories . yet , we would consider it a murder if a doctor hypothetically concluded that this person would come back to life in 12 hours with a high probability . i do n't see the difference between these two situations besides our own perception of life . but of course , this is n't an isolated case : there is a woman who is bearing the child . if the woman feels uncomfortable with carrying another life within her body , regardless of how it happened ( accidental , rape , economic concerns , etc ) , then that woman 's quality of life is harmed . frankly , our society never fully put "" life "" as a value over "" the quality of life "" . we do n't have nor support laws that would force people to give up their non-essential luxuries to feed starving children , or pay for hospital bills that can directly save someone 's life . our society values our own comforts , a.k.a personal liberties over saving the lives of others . to me , that is human nature . if we can not be consistent with our values ourselves , we can not enforce it to other people . if we can not give up luxuries ( better cars , better houses etc ) in exchange for possibly saving life , how is it right to force woman who must take on both the emotional and physical toll of having the baby to keep it against her will ? i am fully aware that abortion is "" direct "" while the failure to help others is "" indirect "" , but their implications are the same for me . to sum it up , i am actively advocating for allowing women to abort , even with the implication that the fetus that she bears is a life , because we can not possibly uphold everyone to the same moral standard of putting life over quality of life . please change my mind !","for your example of the human in the brain death state the difference would be they were already a person - the fetus never was . you 'd be snuffing out the existence of that person if you killed the body , no such issue exists to me with a fetus but then you said in your explanation that fetus has a 70 % chance of becoming what we universally recognize as a human . if the unborn is only something that might some day become a human , then it 's not the moral equivalent of a human . nobody would excuse a parent for starving their children on the basis that they did n't feel like getting up and going to the grocery store . parents have a higher obligation to their own offspring than they do strangers , but as a society , we even have obligations to strangers . but even if we had no obligations to the rest of society , parents would still have obligations to their own children . so if the unborn are human beings , then we are not justified in killing it just because killing it gives us a better quality of life . many people argue human fetuses are n't human in a morally significant way . it is not wrong to pull life support that keeps a physical body alive when the person is brain dead , because the person has already lost what makes their life worth something . similarly , it is not wrong to kill a fetus who is not developed enough to be human in a morally meaningful way ( feeling or thinking of any kind ) . human lives are n't something we should protect people 's right to because they 're human . they 're something we should protect because we want other people to protect our lives when we chose to live , and so that we can ( mostly ) trust each other to not kill each other and so that suffering ( pain ) does n't happen ( this one applies to all animals ( with limited exceptions for animals that do n't feel pain ) , not just humans ) , and so that we do n't live in constant fear of being murdered . a fetus is a human when it has human dna . a fetus is alive when it meets the six biological requirements for life . if a premie baby can be considered a baby than a fetus can be considered a baby . if we take it as a given that a fetus is a human . in the case of abortion due to rape , it is just as simple as the fetus not having the right to the person 's needs , since the person was not responsible for putting the fetus in that position . in the case of abortion due to consensual sex , the person is directly responsible for putting the fetus in that position , and killing it would be like negligence resulting in manslaughter . we certainly believe that to be the case after birth - any parent would be criminally charged with neglect if they let their child starve , even though you could argue in a purely libertarian sense that they should not be forced to provide anything at all . men are also often made to pay child support for 18 years , again which may be a major infringement on their personal liberty and desires . if you say that a foetus is also a child , then there 's nothing stopping you making the same argument against abortion ."
9r2h3m,"president trump and his surrogates have created a permission structure for violence against the press and democrats . the news is reporting that many prominent democrats , in addition to cnn , have received suspicious packages , either with "" white powder "" or pipe bombs . ( source ) . president trump and his surrogates have targeted many of the recipients at rallies . by "" targeting "" i mean characterizing these groups as enemies of the people and/or criminals . he has allied himself with people who spread spurious allegations and conspiracies , at least one of which culminated in an armed gunman antagonizing a local pizza parlor . in isolation , all of these are distasteful but not necessarily dangerous . taken as a whole , and in conjunction with his questioning the rule of law , president trump has created a permission structure for vigilantes to act outside the bounds of civilized society . this risk increased when he claimed there were "" good people on both sides "" during the charleston riots and subsequent murder of heather heyer . for better or worse , the president is the leader of the united states beyond policy . they are the person who sets the tone and direction of the whole country , and people understand what is and is not permissible based on what that person does and says . if this person calls the press the enemy of the people and the press becomes the target of harm , potentially terrorism , it 's fair to say that person bears some moral culpability for exercising power and influence to signal this is acceptable . it could be assuaged if they called out this behavior as wrong , but thus far the pattern has been one of soft rebuke and then a pivot to blaming both sides . this does not absolve them of moral culpability , which requires at least some indication of genuine contrition or , at the very least , a systemic appearance of contrition .","there are accusations being made that trump is paying the protesters at our southern border to energize his side for the midterms . as of right now , there is equally as much evidence that this could be similar to the [ 2016 church burning ] ( -- url -- ) where a black churchgoer plastered graffiti on and tried to burn down his church in a fake hate crime . or when a gay man sprayed [ heil trump ] ( -- url -- ) on his church to fake a neo-nazi attack . the democrats ' hatred of trump has meant that any bad thing that all presidents have done in the past , but have been ignored , suddenly become noticeable under trump . this is not so much a reflection of trump ( though a better president would n't have done this anyway ) but a reflection of how people dislike him more than they do other presidents and politicians who do the same sort of things . from the point of view of someone defending trump , trump could drop a cup and the people who dislike him would say he was doing it on purpose to make him look bad . for instance , the larger selection of pictures of the g7 and japan meetings , along with trump 's meeting with the queen , clearly show that he was being courteous in private meetings and engaged in discussion during the g7 , but a selective omission of the whole picture set gives off the impression that he was being rude to the japanese leader and the queen and lectured by other leaders at the g7 . likewise , trump 's recognition of taiwan might have been seen as radical and refreshing had trump been a progressive politician , but given trump 's reactionary views and lack of experience , it was easy for the press and his other government members to present it as an international incident and disastrous for diplomacy . would you flip this around and say that the media and democrats with their accusations of the election being stolen have cultivated a climate that culminated in a gunman shooting at republicans playing softball , several attacks including rand paul , riots and politicians being chased out of restaurants ? the only groups i have seen committing violence en masse lately are fringe left wing groups like antifa who assault people at rallies , threaten trump supporters , vandalise property etc , by trying to label anyone who might support the current administration as "" fasicsts "" , "" nazis "" , and so forth . obama and the clintons are not the only figures recently targeted by attacks using the mail as a vector . suzanne collins and donald trump were targets of ricin attacks via mail . a hostile foreign power ( like russia , just because it 's an obvious suspect ) does n't particularly care which political party is in power so much as it cares about the us being generally destabilized by partisan divides ."
9r26x7,"the world is racist my history teacher just talked about unfairly immigrants being treated unfairly , nativism , laws passed against certain races , and political cartoons from the late 1800s early 1900s . he then showed us modern examples of it throughout the world with political cartoons and news stories , against refugees and mexicans and others , showing us the mindset has n't changed , only the victims . i 'm assuming his purpose was to show us that the world still sucks , but is the world really just as racist as 100 years ago ?","its not so much that the world is racist , its more that people are willing and more comfortable with people that look and act the same as them due to evolutionary reasons . by posting here you are asking to be convinced the world is less racists , and explicitly excluding anyone that would agree with your teacher . if the world is still just as racist as it was how do you explain the relative widespread success of minorities in the west ? the world is n’t racist ; the reason why these races are being deported or refused is because in the past they refuse to assimilate into their society ( most obvious muslims , punching unveil women in the uk or committing rape in france ) other times they would use welfare ( or other social services ) while not even trying to get a job ... you might be think about the usa , the melting pot , but the difference between those immigrants ( chinese , vietnamese , swedes , and so on ) is that assimilated while not causing any trouble , but mexicans and other latin america countries have brought drugs ( look at tucson or la ) and gang activity into the usa . even the legislation passed to encourage people to be more tolerant of other races can not and has not stopped racism . the world is not just as racist as it was 100 years ago mainly because racism is largely seen as a negative quality . 100 years ago it was n't . this means that people who still believe these archaic ideas have had for the most part keep their racist beliefs to themselves or face the social consequences of being labeled racist . again this has not eliminated racism , its just made racists have to be more conscious of the beliefs of others around them . if they are in an anonymous or socially homogeneous setting they will likely be openly racist , but if anonymity can not be guaranteed , racists have to be more cautious because today , unlike 100 years ago there is the possibility of negative consequences . we came from a racist culture that allowed slavery ( just like now it allows slavering non-human animals ) so there 's still a piece of that , but there 's also ghettos that make some people bad and that 's usually very related to a low economic situation and a different skin colour . the "" world "" is n't racist , but human beings are naturally inclined to feelings of tribalism and racial bias . by and large , global civilization is just as racist today as it was 100 years ago , more so in some cases . for various reasons , it 's very hard to get most white people to accept that truth , which in my opinion , is the reason our society is still as racist as it is . in other words , we all say inter-racial marriage is fine , but none of us want to date a black person , or for a black person to marry our daughters , etc . tl/dr your history teacher was right , but it 's humans who are racist , not the world . in 1918 it was ok to segregate school children by skin color , black people were n't allowed to play sports for the mlb , an interracial couple would be scoffed at in public and disowned by their respective families , and it was completely ok if a restaurant wanted to refuse service to a black person . 100 years earlier in 1818 it was absolutely fine for a white person to own a black person and whip them if they misbehaved . so although racism has n't disappeared , the world is certainly less racist than it used to be ."
9r25mn,"the house should adopt a rule that adds extra representatives to ensure that the composition of the house mirrors the popular vote . so for example , if the popular vote in the midterms is 55 % republicans and 45 % democrats but because of gerrymandering democrats get 51 % of the seats in the house , then , under this law , more republican seats would be added until the distribution of seats mirrors the popular vote . the number of seats added would change after each election depending on how many are needed to reflect the popular vote . i.e. maybe in 2018 there are 445 reps ( 435 +10 ) and in 2020 there is 438 ( 435 +3 ) . this system is used in germany and i think it is quite effective there . you get the benefits of both the first past the post system , in that every person has a representative that they can contact , with the benefits of a proportional representation system , as the composition of the house would reflect the will of the people .","so , in germany , non-mandated seats are assigned representatives by the party , not the voters . this results in politicians whose careers are based on being good party members , which is not necessarily on supporting the mandate of the voters in their district . essentially , it would do the opposite - make representatives less beholden to the individual voters . in the us , representatives are elected to represent their districts in local and national issues . the proposed national allocation of representatives would stick someone with a representative that they did not pick , and who would not represent the majority in that district on important local issues . regardless of how many states and representatives we feel there should be , most anthropologists agree that humans are quite literally incapable of working together in groups of more than about 150 . since you need a constitutional amendment to do this anyway , just pass a constitutional amendment regarding the drawing of districts in order to eliminate gerrymandering ."

if the answer is "" no , voting does n't matter "" that 's the end of discussion for me . talk to the hand . change my view .","obviously we have to trust people who are talking about their own preferences and experience , and there are legitimate experts , but most of the time we tend to think that claims are True or not based on their own merits . i 'll tune someone out for thoughtlessly repeating talking points , but asking whether they voted seems like a waste of time , and , by the time that someone claims to know what 's wrong in washington and claims to have the answers , i 'm pretty happy to ignore them just because i think they 're pretentious . what about all the people that ca n't vote such as minors , people living in u.s territories , prisoners , people with disabilities , and homeless people who can not vote , but still have opinions on politics such as wanting one candidate to win over another or hope a policy from a party to become a law . by saying that people who do n't vote should shut their complaining about public policy , or politics in general , you are turning your hand against millions who want to vote in the united states , but ca n't because of one reason or another . so i have the option to choose between one party that hates me , and a second party who hates me . according to you i ca n’t complain about the options being people who are absolutely nothing about me unless i vote for one of those people ? if you vote , you are agreeing that the system is legitimate and you will abide by the process . if you want to complain that it 's rigged , broken , or not a reasonable system , you have to withhold your vote and avoid legitimizing the system . if you vote , you are agreeing that the system is legitimate and you will abide by the process . if you want to complain that it 's rigged , broken , or not a reasonable system , you have to withhold your vote and avoid legitimizing the system . but we should dismiss someone 's complaints or arguments based on the actual content of their complains or arguments , not on what actions they took to resolve that complaint . let 's take an outlier example to demonstrate : if a brilliant political scientist or computer programmer or whomever points to a specific public policy , and says , "" this public policy is the greatest cause of society 's ills , and i have a the perfect solution to it , "" should i give him the hand merely because he does n't vote ? and in fact , not all public policies can even be resolved by voting . but thanks to our system , i have ultimately no control over the actual senate . in other words , why would my participation in a system that does n't influence the ultimate majority leader ( and therefore the one who sets the senate agenda ) give me the right to criticize the public policy of the senate ? so most of us , even those of us who vote , will not be voting in the elections influencing the actual public policy concerning us ; this is a republic , in a country with a political binary , and our votes are diluted and in some cases entirely invalidated by the byzantine systems in place , but we still ought to be entitled to , and listened to , when we complain about those policies . maybe you 've got a point about people in swing stages . what if you did n't vote for a various reason like ' too young , ' ' was not a citizen then ' , or ' was a felon but now just gained ability to vote in new york ' ? so regardless of whether i vote , my interests will be reflected in congress and the electoral college . the content of my views are just as valid ( or invalid if you disagree with them ) regardless of whether i cast my meaningless vote . i say this as a person who has voted in every election i 've been eligible for : every presidential , midterm , local vote . but if you asked people who do n't vote why they do n't vote , many of them would tell you that they feel like no candidates can represent their interests and therefore their vote does n't matter to them . no candidates look like me , and i ca n't imagine that any have real experience with lives like mine . what if you were unable to vote because you were too young or not a citizen during the last election ? what if you simply forgot to register , were unknowingly purged from the voter rolls , were hospitalized , or unable to vote because you had to be at your job ? is it reasonable or acceptable for them to answer "" i prefer to keep that private -- voting booths are private and i think that who i cast my vote for should remain private . "" i 've vote in every election i 've been able to and not once has it changed the result ( i 've never been involved in an election won by a single vote , let alone one that was a tie ) . i could say that writing your congressman is far more meaningful than voting ( since , among other things less people do it and you can convey more nuance than a vote ) while voting is pretty meaningless , so how do you react to me saying "" if you have never written your congressmen , talk to the hand "" ? even if my one vote had the power to pick hillary or trump for president , that is still something i could complain about as there are a lot of things that both would continue to push like the military industrial complex ."
9r1tsr,"the division between americans due to politics is enough to warrant separate counties there are many countries that have very similar cultures but are separate ( germany and austria , india and pakistan , romania and moldova , north and south korea , etc ) . the american population seems to have differences comparable to many of these countries , and the biggest difference , in terms of prevalence and magnitude , seems to be the absolute hatred between people that identify as republican and people that identify as democrat . hell , i think americans have a less negative feeling toward canadians ( who are culturally similar to americans but have a separate country in a situation similar to the other countries mentioned ) than their own countrymen of opposing political party . if this is not a house divided i do n't know what is . i think the major thing that is keeping america together is an almost religious devotion to the country 's great achievements in the past and to the country 's founding documents . and i think the former will lessen with time to a point where , if nothing changes , the division between americans will be enough to overcome it and the devotion to its founding documents . this is based totally on subjective perception , and not any hard data . i am canadian and do n't know the situation in america as a fact , i do n't know if the division is as great as i perceive it to be , or if my perception of what is keeping america together is correct . however , i do think that my statement is likely correct , cmv .","some want to fundamentally transform the country to mirror european nations while others want government out of their lives entirely . it may seem like ideological fracturing . however , this diversity was baked into the cake of the american experiment . the u.s. is unique since its founding is based on the idea of individual freedom within a democratic society ( this description fits under the broad umbrella of "" american exceptionalism "" ) . this necessarily means that there will be a great diversity in what individuals think the country should stand for . states/regions will have different values , cultures , and local laws ( if you do n't like the way that north carolina runs things , then you can move to utah , e.g. ) . there is much that we do not have in common , but the founding documents are certainly one of them , which may help explain the "" religious devotion "" that you observe . separating the country into multiple countries therefore eliminates what the u.s. was designed to be . i know people are suggesting here that it 's a simple "" urban / rural divide "" , but that 's not entirely accurate either . yes , "" more "" people of a progressive ideology live in urban areas , and "" more "" people of conservative viewpoints live in rural areas , but actually the largest pocket of conservative viewpoints is suburban . many people in really rural areas are n't as conservative as they 're more libertarian . meanwhile there are very progressive ' rural ' areas around the country . point being the divide in the us is exceptionally complex , is ideologically based , and is pushed largely by bad-actors making it worse . if you want to split the country , please explain specifically how you 'd do that . us is different than those examples because the split is more rural/urban than a line across the country that can split it . also , i 've noticed the colleges in southern cities tend to be even more extremely left than some northern colleges , maybe to "" compensate "" for the rest of the state and its reputation . we have 11 million inhabitants of which 6 million speak dutch and 4 million french . meaning we 'd be a country with less inhabitants than many major cities in other countries ( metropolitan area included ) . the divide in america politically is n't geographical , while it often sounds like a north + west coast vs south divide ( especially to outsiders like us canadians ) , it is far more a rural vs urban divide , and thus impossible to divide the country geographically without just having the same divided politics in both countries , the electoral system helps to obfuscate this division , for example california seems entirely politically left as it votes 100 % democrat every election , except it has many counties that are thoroughly republican , but in the presidential election ( the only one whose results really get noticed to foreigners ) , these votes are n't enough to sway the state wide totals . i would submit to you that americans agree on the vast majority of items that are essential to a country : the differences today are nothing compared to the civil rights movement or the civil war yet we made it through those periods , came to the right answer , and moved forward . the split is n't between parties , it 's between - to simplify - big city dwellers and rural folk . big city dwellers are blue , and rural dwellers are red . over the next ten to thirty years , the nation will become less white and a huge chunk of the republican base will die of old age . this divide is n't so much a divide as it is a tipping point , and the tree seems poised to fall on the blue side . i think the political divisions are pretty wide right now , or at least wider on average than they generally have been previously . but those disagreements are , for the most part , about how the us should be run and how policies should be implemented . there really is n't much disagreement about whether the us should exist , and the vast majority of people in either party agree that they want to stay part of the same country . if everybody pretty much agrees that we should all stay one country and not be divided , why would the divisions be sufficient to warrant separating into multiple countries ? separating the country due to political disagreements when most philosophical basis are agreed on is what i would call "" the cowards way out "" . additionally , the us is divided in states that hold quite a bit of power to manage themselves . also , to be clear that my intent is not to call you coward : i believe your thoughts come from the lower and lower management freedom allowed by federal powers to the state to manage themselves . i am not american and am not an expert but i see great potential for states to manage themselves in more depth . it is much easier to implement policies and less risky when it does n't have to be concerned about over 300 million peoples , each with great differences of lifestyle , ideologies ... and mistakes can be taken care more easily and only in grave cases would the federal government enter the play field to help fix the issues every country is divided in political parties , it 's just very outspoken in the us , that does n't mean you can split the country ."
9r1sy9,"modifying skin color ( i.e. blackface ) for costumes is not racist as long as the wearer is not accentuating stereotypes or mocking . i got into an argument at work about this and now a co-worker has labeled me as a racist . as a white male , if i wanted to dress up as lando from star wars for halloween this year and decided to modify my skin color with make up in order to make the costume look more real then i do not think this decision would be morally wrong or racist in any way . modifying my skin color would be racist/wrong if i did it to accentuate stereotypes associated with african americans . it would also be wrong if i did blackface as a way to mock individuals . but racism is the belief that one race is superior to another or is entitled to do things that members of another race are not . using makeup to change the color of my skin does not promote those beliefs , therefore it is not a racist or a discriminatory action . disclaimer : i would not do this due to the nature of the current social climate in america because people would certainly get offended . but just because someone of another race is offended by an action is not cause to label that action as racist or discriminatory .","the problem with changing your skin color to imitate a character or real person , outside of the historical baggage , is that you are making their skin color a piece of the costume when it is not . if i wore a denver broncos football jersey with the number 18 on it , would fans of football be able to identify who i was portraying if i did not have white skin ? what if i wore a detroit lions jersey with the number 20 , would football fans be able to identify who i was portraying if i was asian ? what about if i wore a red cape , blue skin tight body suit with a red "" s "" on my chest and red underwear on the outside , would people be able to identify who i was portraying if i had brown skin ? people would be able to identify all three people , two of which are real people , because the their skin color ha nothing to do with why we know them . barry sanders was a great running back who happened to be black . furthermore , changing your skin color to portray a poc or a character that is a poc is something that is done predominantly by white people in derogatory situations like poorly themed gatherings like a "" ghetto party "" . it needs to be noted that blackface is not just altering your skin color . i 'm not trying to change your mind about how or why people get upset about blackface , but i want to convince you that when people say or write "" racist "" they often mean something different than the definition you gave here . and , in particular , that when people call blackface racist , what they usually mean is that wearing blackface is racially insensitive . so if someone were to wear blackface and suggest that black people like to eat fried chicken and corn bread , or like to drink cool aid , would that be racist according to the definition of racism you gave in the post ? it is generally not necessary to change your skin color to portray a particular character . usually , their attributes , style and clothing are what makes the character work . a choice that 's regarded as racist by people who suffer most from racism . \ > but racism is the belief that one race is superior to another or is entitled to do things that members of another race are not if you use blackface , you intentionally join a group of people that are racist . you ca n't blame others for perceiving you as racist when you wear something that marks you as such . it 's discriminatory to deny people acting roles that would be better suited for them when they ca n't get a job in a white role , and racist to deny people the right to do the same thing to white people . you are morally wrong and racist because you know that there is a large group of people that would be negatively impacted by and upset with your decision and who have an extremely legitimate and verifiable reason to be upset by that decision . we are barely half a century past a time where black people in america were segregated and legally considered second class citizens . we 're only a hundred and fifty years past a time where black people in america were considered property and subjected to unpaid labor , stripped of all freedom , rights , property , and dignity . black face ; that is , white men putting makeup on their face to portray black people , has an extremely prominent place in the mockery and dehumanization of black people . when you live in a society where that is spelled out very clearly by your fellow citizens who have inherited that history of slavery and injustice , some of whom actually lived through that segregation , and they speak to you , their countrymen , their brother , in a unified voice , and ask you , please do not do that thing , even if you do n't personally hold those views , because it is representative and emblematic of a truly dark and twisted time for their people , and you ignore the totality of that to do something for personal gratification , that is wrong . in a total void of all culture , sure , the act of darkening your skin is not morally wrong or racist . if you legitimately had no idea that there were a large group of marginalized people who have historically been publicly mocked and dehumanized through the use of blackface , than your initial decision to dress up as lando would not be morally wrong because you did not understand and were not aware of the morals you were violating . but when hundreds of thousands upon millions of people say , "" please do not do that thing or wear that thing because it is an embodiment of the centuries of slavery , dehumanization and humiliation that your ancestors subjected my ancestors to "" , and you choose to do that thing anyway despite you gaining absolutely nothing by doing it except a sort of cool halloween costume , then your actions are morally wrong and racist . you ca n’t just discount the historical context behind blackface because you do n’t think it ’s racist anymore . the fact is that blackface has always been used as a way of mocking black people , and you do n’t get to determine how other people perceive you if you do it . i mean , it ’s even more “ mundane ” than painting your face black , but the historical context is there all the same . you simply need to check yourself , muster some empathy and perspective , and realize that certain actions are still taboo . i ’m also honestly amazed you thought you can argue your way into convincing someone blackface is n’t racist . the distinction lies that the actor 's skin color is not an aspect of the character himself and changing your skin color to fit the costume makes gambino 's race into something that you can wear , like a mask . being black does n't represent lando 's character and if your intent is to try to represent the "" blackness "" of lando , i do n't think you can sum up the black experience with makeup . i 've literally never seen a blackface costume that was n't accentuating stereotypes or mocking ... now imagine you have a lot of people who like to dress up like your friend and mock them . now you pretty much hate anyone who dresses up as your friend . then one day someone dresses up as your friend , but actually does n't do it in a mocking way . back to your friend , imagine other people , instead of dressing up as him , would call him names , not let him into places , assume the worst about him , and do their best to avoid them . if you did black up for a costume , i would not assume that you are a racist ( which i 'm not really sure is a thing ) , or that you had racist intent imagine if your baby died in a fire , and then next week one of your close friends shows up to your place the next week wearing this on a t-shirt : -- url -- you say "" hey man , that 's really rude and insensitive . "" he responds "" umm , just because you are offended by this t-shirt is not cause to label this t-shirt rude or insensitive . i did n't wear it with the intent to accentuate your grief ; i just got it at a store and thought it was fun to wear . "" the problem is that you can not dictate your standards onto other people there 's no objective way to determine such things , everything is subjective and as such the person perceiving how you behave will interpret your behavior according to their standards not according to yours , you might do things that you do n't consider racist or done in poor taste , other people will consider that differently . if you want to be in the clear you have to be attuned to how other people might perceive your behavior , not how something "" objectively "" is -- because there 's really no such thing when it comes to "" how people see things "" -- there 's a contradiction in terms . with the best intentions , and the best costumes , your argument might make sense . however , in 99.9 % of the cases it 's lazy dressing up at best . persons are defined by a multitude of characteristics , skin color is just one of them . if you want to dress like a person , you 've got to determine what defines them and more importantly their looks . but note that none of the simple descriptions above mention the black skin . that 's because often that is not a defining feature of the person . if you dress up in a suit and put on blackface , you 're not dressed as obama . hell , it will probably more recognizable if you paint your face red and blue . costumes are never a precise likeness of the person you 're dressing up as . if you insist on blackface in your costume , you insist having black skin is one of the main defining features of the famous person , while often is not . by focusing your costume on a black face , you 're showing the world that being black is something irregular that sets that famous poison apart from the rest . the reality is that some things just have so much historical baggage associated with them that they ca n't be done at all . swastikas were used by a number of military and religious groups prior to wwii , but there is just so much historical baggage thanks to the nazis . we ca n't ignore that history and , like the swastika , it is still too recent to make blackface culturally allowable . some things just ca n't / should n't be separated from their troubled pasts . while you might not intend to offend , it still would , and that lack of care on your part could very well be deemed racist - at at the very least , insensitive to the extreme ."

otherwise you risk having policies over geographies that just do n't support them ( and separatism ) . the bundesrat in germany works like the us senate but it gives all states a minimum of 3 votes , states with over 2 million people 4 votes , states with over 6 million inhabitants 5 votes and states with over 7 million 6 votes . so bavaria with 12 million has 6 votes and berlin with 3 million has 4 . this means the smaller states are represented but not as disproportionately as in the us . in order to entice states to join the united states , the pot had to be sweetened . let me fix your title : cmv : bring on civil wars because i want despots in new york and california represent everyone in the us . the senate were supposed to be selected by people who already had a sense of good government , while the house was there to represent the caprices of the people . the senate was specifically designed to give each state equal representation in the federal government in spite of population differences . the whole point is california ca n't bully wyoming into doing what it wants . the founding fathers wanted to strike a balance between allowing equal representation for all people ( population based congress ) and allowing equal representation between state interests ( state based congress ) . our house of representatives has seats distributed based on population density taken from the census , the senate has seats distributed evenly , 2 per state . this system works to balance out the 2 interests - the interests of population majority and the interests of states ' rights . it ’s a representative republic and as such more weight is given to smaller states through the senate and electoral college intentionally to offset the risk of the majority oppressing the minority . without these checks and balances the majority in ny and ca would determine all of the laws and regulations for the entire country ... at the expense of the minority who have very different interests and needs than said majority . the commenters here are mostly conservative , and therefore benefit from the structure of the senate . the senate makes sense only if you consider the individual states to be sovereign entities where the people living within each state have separate identities . there is no good reason that my vote should be more powerful living in philadelphia as it would in new york , just because fewer people happen to live in the arbitrarily created boundaries of this state . as for the other arguments made here about the senate preventing against tyranny of the majority , these people should take a look at our current government . if we were to have a popularly elected president and a non-gerrymandered house , so that those branches actually did represent the people , then perhaps the existence of the non democratic senate could be tolerable . at present , zero branches of government represent the people , which is how you wind up with a racist president who calls himself a nationalist emboldened by a plutocratic congress despite the country being almost 40 % non-white . however , it is more fair than the alternative , which would strip the voting power of the minority states to virtually nothing . although the eu is not a federation or structured in the same way as the united states , it ’s certainly reasonable to draw parallels . for the us , each state is partially sovereign , but also a part of the overall federation . one way is weighted based on the population of its member states . the other is based on the virtue of being a state . prior to the creation of the the federal government , each state made a conscious agreement to join based on different contingencies . the more populated states have more of a voice in the federal government . but the less populated states would not have been incentivized to join if their voice was almost entirely drowned out by other states with larger populations . so they came up with the connecticut compromise to make an adjustment so that those less populated states had both representation based on population and the virtue of being a state . now , although again it ’s not a perfect parallel , 4 countries make up > 50 % of the population of the eu . if germany , france , uk , and italy had more similar interests than the other 24 and voted solely based on population , they could enact policies that harm the other 86 % of member states . more populated states still get louder voices , but the representation of the states is corrected to a ‘ fair ’ way that their membership was predicated on . more populous states have their representation corrected downwards , less populated states have their membership corrected upwards , but the rank order of the representation of all states still falls perfectly in line with their population . and they all agreed to this , again due to the weight of their population and the virtue of being a state . it would be entirely unfair to backtrack and revise the structure of representation without giving the delawares and wyomings and north dakotas the choice to leave the federation . the senate is not suppose to represent the people at all . it represents the states , which are the member units of the federation that is the usa republic and every state deserves equal representation in it . should it weight representation by criticality of function ( the low-population bread-basket states are crucial for the function of american society , but only engage a slim portion of its population ) ? without the senate , only a handful of states would run the entire country ."
9qwgbk,"moderators "" locking "" a post on reddit serves no purpose other than to censor and stop free speech first , i would say that free speech and debate are values i hold closely , because i think people need to be able to engage in debate and dialogue to have a healthy society . secondly , i think there are rare exceptions to my stance against locking posts , like if an individual is being doxxed or harassed , but 99 % of the times it happens it just seems like an effort to stifle free speech and debate in the comments . even if the comments become "" toxic "" ( whatever that means ) , i do n't see why the moderators should have to step in and stop things .","in many subreddits , such as this one , once you reach that point of thousands of replies with a ton of rule breaking , the purpose of the thread has already been fulfilled . so if a thread is creating a ton of work and headaches for the mods with no real purpose , it makes sense to lock it . a good portion of a mod 's work is janitorial and in big subs this means taking on numerous reports every day where you have to go and check it out , check the context , see if it breaks a rule , issue warnings or bans , reply to complaints in mod mail , etc . this goes through the roof in controversial threads that get a lot of attention and reach that point of just being a troll fest . do you believe that any and all conversations and speech should be allowed at any and all times and in any and all venues or locations ? free speech does not guarantee a platform from which to speak . take r/askhistorians for example , there 's no place for free speech there . if the whole point of a sub is dogs and it is overrun by politics it wo n't really be bout dogs will it ? moderation is to keep things on topic and how the most people in the sub can enjoy maximum enjoyment while staying True to the sub . most of the time when a major thread gets locked its because it has hit the front page or been x-posted to another sub and the moderators are getting a flood of reports of users outside of their usual community coming in , brigading the post , and attacking their users . at a certain point a post has gained it general momentum - the top posts have such an overwhelming majority of the traffic simply by virtue of the kind of snowball effect karma voting gives post visibility - and as such the conversation beyond that point is simply being derailed by agitators . worst is when that hostility starts crossing into pm 's and witch hunts of users across other subs . this happens less frequently with smaller subs and niche interest subs , tends to happen more with highly populated subs or those with controversial subject matter ... but the moderators of a sub are n't necessarily there to create a perfect free speech zone . what they are there to do is curate a good user experience for their subscribers and to encourage the kind of content they want to see in their community . if you want to call it a "" safe space "" for niche discussions , that might be a decent analogy . once a sub gets derailed by a mob of external users , that discussion is no longer serving the benefit of the community nor fostering the experience they want for their users , and so the moderators have a certain duty to maintain the experience they have created for their users and to quarantine a post which is negatively affecting their subscribers . the first amendment specifies that congress cant pass any laws that inhibit free speech . the entire reason moderators exist is so someone is there to step in and moderate ; it 's in the name . in a real-life debate floor , they can call for a period of silence while they get things back on track , but that does n't exist as a tool in an online forum . i moderate a subreddit that is both specific to a subject matter , but it 's also a sensitive subject matter since it involves discussing a True-crime podcast . we lock threads as a last resort , either because people are breaking the rules to the point where it 's best to lock the discussion and order everyone to move on . - you 're free to have an opinion , it does n't mean everyone else has to give you the space to share it . you might have free speech , but if you 're sitting in a cafe discussing your sexual exploits in public , the owner has every right to tell you to gtfo . - overall this ' my free speech ' argument comes from a grossly enlarged sense of entitlement , that you have a ' right ' to say , do , behave , and act how you want without consequences , and anyone who attempts to exact consequences is attacking your ' right ' . that 's a lame excuse for bad behavior hiding behind a flimsy understanding of free speech . locking a thread is a safe way to halt a problem discussion and force people to drop it and move on . ultimately that 's what is desired : stop the problem behavior and get people to move on . subreddits are n't free speech platforms though , they 're moderated platforms , hence the existence moderators . people are free to create their own subreddits and regulate them as they choose to . if you want to create your own subreddit with a free speech policy you can , but others may not want to , and there is perfectly good reasons to have rules for commenters . for me , my priority is not creating a space of political debate , it 's a place for people to discuss the hobby the subreddit is centered around , so why should i be concerned with allowing long-winded political tangents , racism , and incivility in my comment section ? it does n't in any way further the purpose of the subreddit , so nothing is lost if posts are locked to remove this content . unless my subreddit is directly related to politics , why is it my job to provide a space for two angry commenters to get in a slapfight over immigration ? and if i run a support/advice sub , or a sub that is for educational purposes , strict moderation benefits the purpose of the subreddit moreso than allowing comments that are hostile/unsupportive and filled with misinformation . we lock threads here if the sheer number of rule breaking comments becomes a problem for us . our queue was full of rule breaking comments from that one thread . at that point we made the decision to lock it because it had served its purpose to the op and it was stifling our ability to moderate the rest of the forum productively because it 's rule violations were making it difficult to get to anything else in the moderation queue . we did n't do it to stifle free speech , in fact i felt bad about all the innocent people whose conversations we stopped , we did it to better moderate this community ."
9qwbqt,"the democratic party was deeply damaged by obama 's presidency and will be rescued by trump 's look , plenty of historians have yet to weigh in on obama 's legacy and certainly we can not predict the post-trump future . this post was inspired by two fairly insightful commentators ( glenn loury and nate silver ) , who point to some interesting ways in which both leaders brought both creative and destructive forces to bear on their own parties . regardless of which party you prefer , it would seem that both parties are good at self-immolation -- just on different timescales . i 'm open to any interpretation backed by evidence and solid reasoning . here 's a summary of the view i 'd like challenged : obama precipitated and oversaw the unprecedented collapse of electoral fortunes of the democratic party on both state and federal levels ( cite ) whereas , trump 's presidential win sowed the seeds of a coming decade of democratic competitiveness and electoral effectiveness ( cite ) .","parties are constantly changing and coming in and out of fashion , just because they are now what makes you think either donald trump or barack obama are the causes or the effects of these changes or their popularity ? additionally , there was a generational disparity between older roosevelt democrats and the younger and rebellious baby boomers , so the party was a lot less united than republicans for nixon . finally , democrats were much slower to accept the civil rights movement ( or rejected it like george wallace ) . the popular vote was close , but nixon won the election with the help of the so-called "" silent majority . "" he was a popular president and won re-election handily ; democrats won only 17 electoral votes . democrats won only 13 electoral votes in the 1984 election . not only had democrats lost control of the executive branch for nearly two decades , but liberal and progressive governance that was so popular in the 1930 's had fully run dry ; one can argue that eisenhower and nixon governed in more left-leaning fashion , but reagan and bush certainly did n't . on the other hand , the w. bush presidency was terrible for republicans . obama entered office with a filibuster-proof majority in the senate , a majority in the house , the strong support of the millennial generation , and a positive attitude from "" hope and change . "" that 's a strong rebuke against republicans . he left office with a party divided between establishment democrats and progressive democrats , but the party still barely lost the presidential election and will likely win back the house in a few weeks . obama 's legacy was marred in part by the gop 's tactics of stalling and denying in the face of evidence and reason - see here their hardline stance against the aca , attempting to prevent then to repeal , and yet when opportunity arose to do so after trump 's election they had no plan , no prepared legislation , and scrambled to throw together a couple dozen pages full of "" insert legislation here "" brackets . what hurt obama 's legacy and what hurt the dnc in 2016 was imo nothing that obama could control - what hurt the dnc and has tainted his legacy leaving office is the meddling of foreign interests ( namely russian social media derailing tactics ) and the fervour of easily manipulated low-income white voters who are ticket line republican voters . the gop showed their hand in 2016 more than any other year that they are not present in government to argue in good faith , they do not have the interests of the common american people at heart , and their base is predeposed to getting fired up by scapegoating , fearmongering , and blame shifting . i am not saying the dnc is not culpable in their own loss but what i think what really hurt the party when facing such an overwhelming wave of lash back against obama 's terms and progressive gains such as marriage equality was disunity amongst liberal voters . hillary clinton was not a good choice to be the poster-candidate for the democratic party . bill clinton is an easy target for smear campaigning , whether you think that its reasonable or not ( again , we have seen that trump 's base are not reasonable ) , pushing for a female president right after a black president was an exceedingly bold and risky move when looking at the anti-sjw rhetoric that was being used to fired up the right , and i think worst of all the tactics used to try to smear bernie sanders ruined the chances the dnc had for picking up third party and independent voters without party affiliations . many people , whether you agree with the rationale or not , saw the choice between trump and hillary as picking the worst of two evils , and there were a considerable number of independent voters who wanted someone who was an outsider to what was seen as slimy career politicians and to them their choices were bernie ( a historic independent who had a well demonstrated history of standing by principles ) or trump ( a total outsider to politics come out of nowhere ) . even facing those odds - hillary won the popular vote by an unprecedented historical margin , and trump only won through the electoral college system . the gop has shown they are willing to gerrymander and stack the odds - approaching this election cycle we are already seeing the gop purge voting records and do everything they can to disenfranchise voters who threaten their seats . between the bias of the electoral college , the systemic bias that 's been pushed by the gop to disenfranchise threatening voters , and the unfortunate disunity the dnc caused by so vehemently opposing sanders as a candidate , i do n't see how obama can really take the blame for the losses in 2016 . i do n't know anything in depth about the effect of obama 's presidency on democratic fortunes but i think it 's a case of correlation is not causation . yes obama was president during the collapse of the democratic party but i do n't think he 's directly to blame . on another point , in the 8 years since his election , the best the democratic party could come up with was hillary ? she 's not bad but it felt like a big step down from obama , who as i mentioned was n't that great anyway . the democratic party is more to blame for its own demise than obama . being anti-trump is not enough for a population that is grudgingly accepting at least another two years of donald and the democratic party does n't seem to have enough in the bag to convince voters they have a better solution . point being that the bush administration had n't adequately responded to the financial crisis which then required the incoming obama administration to burn a lot of political capital fighting it , spending a lot of time on that , making unpopular compromises ( not holding the people responsible , well , responsible ) and making financial conservatives unhappy by spending money . now , looking back - as with other things - time has shown that republicans were no longer a party able to compromise on an issue like this , having moved to far to the right and having become more fundamentalist since the gingrich revolution , so maybe democrats should have jammed it through . i think the us congress has reached a point where major legislation only has chance to pass via quasi loopholes ( passed through budget reconciliation ) or with super majorities . i think loury points out some tactical mistakes of obama when it comes to race but overall i think those do n't matter , i do n't think anything obama could have done would have changed the narrative building on fox news and the part of the electorate watching it ... and its not that those dogwhistles are new , they 've been around for decades , probably centuries . i think the forces at work are too big for somebody like obama to make a huge difference once elected , the election itself makes a big difference but other than that i think congress is too much on a one-way road to total gridlock and cultural dynamics are too strong for a single president to change the course of whats happening . obama getting elected basically layed the groundwork for democrats ' defeats in the midterms , which coincided with redistricting . yes , obama did a bad job at building a bench of democrats and probably generally spend to little on strengthening their position countrywide . i think obama 's presidency wo n't be seen as a failure . unlike lbj he did n't get his grander vision destroyed by a war he could n't let himself give up , unlike gw bush he did n't start a big war . he was president at a time where big legislation was essentially impossible to pass ( and wo n't be alone in that ) and his identity happened to contribute to already worsening polarization ."

nationalism is a good thing because it will re-focus investment on american institutions , and less on global subsidizations and charity . change my view .","however , othering is also somewhat unavoidable , and without some amount of nationalism , there would n't be nations in the first place , which some might consider to be a good thing , and others not so much . basically , i think that nationalism can be at least morally neutral if it is simply privileging the needs of one group without actively engaging in the harm of another group of people . however , the drawbacks of nationalism are usually too great , as it frequently leads to the imbalance of power , which further increases the inequity of the society . i think a more charitable approach where all humans can benefit each other regardless of divisions is the ideal , which is very opposite to the foundations of nationalistic thought . nationalists are the people who hate any form of change because to them their country is perfect . when people advocate for a change , nationalists see it as a personal attack against themselves and what they believe in . by believing that any criticism means hating the country , nationalists dont add to any conversation - they just shut down conversations . b ) to again emphasize how it 's a False dichotomy , hypothetically let 's say for just $ 100,000 we could boost pakistan 's school system to be 500 % more efficient . you are Falsely assuming that the us helps refugees , fights poverty , contributes to the world economy , etc. , for non-self-serving reasons . the us is n't a global superpower because that is the nice thing to do ; the us is a global superpower because it benefits the us to have control over what goes on in the rest of the world , on multiple levels . economic nationalism ( or populism ) is n't inherently wrong or evil , the problem is it has n't been implemented properly and likely never will , same can be said for socialism . the problem is trump 's version of nationalism is n't even economic nationalism or populism because that would mean taking care of his nation 's citizens which means not gutting programs that benefit those citizens like ahca , medicare and medicaid . the only citizens he 's benefitted are the wealthy and arguably some sectors of manufacturing and agriculture industry but that 's not helping nearly as many as a left populist movement . a left populism would arguably do both , put the country first and improve social programs like ahca , medicare and medicaid . you can look at that as a good or bad , i happen to look at it as bad even if i do n't agree with 80 % of what trump nationalism stands for . as a nevadan , maybe i only care about the people of my state . nationalism is oriented towards developing and maintaining a national identity based on shared , social characteristics , such as culture and language , religion and politics , and a belief in a common ancestry . a problem arises when , like in our case , where nationalists take actions against minorities to promote a shared culture/religion/politics / ancestry . it 's not always so upfront and aggressive , but it always seeks to push out "" the other "" in an effort to maintain a cultural identity or purity . daca recipients were raised here , speak english , and are culturally american . we 've invested all this money on educating these people , but instead of letting them participate in our economy we deport them and push them out . i think the issue is that nobody has a handle on what nationalism is and what exactly would be a nationalist action . nationalism , as orwell describes it -- url -- is essentially talking about your in group as superior to every other group , and being invested in that certain group . and in fact , nationalism and extremism often stems from here . trump promises to bring back coal jobs . this is a bullshit policy , because energy has already started to pour into renewables because money does n't lie , and coal is a dead industry . it 's not about whether ordinary people get anything out of this , it 's whether or not ordinary people can be swayed by the sheer rhetoric needed to pass things that are n't as good . i do n't think , however , that there is a necessary reason that putting america first has to build americans up as a supreme force and then force everything through on emotion . it has to be the case that we need immigrants to build our houses , or that we want universal healthcare to ensure that everyone gets treated and it 's more efficient to do that or we want a welfare state because everyone needs to be able to fail in order to take the risks that make people great ."
9qrzno,"if you are a single issuer voter on a hotly debated topic you are getting played by special interest groups and political strategists i watched the roe v wade documentary on netflix and part of the documentary was about political strategists that took the topic of abortion and used it to rally an untapped base to vote more . it got me thinking that a lot of what we hear about large political issues is probably from special interest groups and strategists who do n't actually care about taking action on an issue , but more so want to use it to get you to go vote for their politician . this creates politicians that do n't actually want to fix the problem because their rallying cry would be gone . issues i 'm talking about include , but are not limited to : abortion weed legalization healthcare gun laws i 'm not saying if you have opinions on any of these you 're wrong , i 'm saying that if you say "" i 'm only voting for someone if they want to legalize weed "" you 've played into exactly what they want . thanks","it makes perfect sense to make that your single issue if you 're passionate about it . the person that gets elected from your district is almost definitely going to make some key votes on that exact issue during the next few years . it makes perfect sense to vote that single issue if you 're passionate about it . electing and voting for obama over mccain is the direct cause of the legalization of gay marriage . he appointed 2 of the 5 supreme court justices to overturn the ruling , had mccain won he would have elected two conservative justices , like kavanaugh and gorsuch who would have voted against it . you have anti 2a groups who look to limit or eliminate gun rights while pro 2a do n't budge an inch on this issue because they know it wo n't stop where ever the "" compromise "" is . then you have issues like climate change where you are getting played to a degree no matter which side of this you are on . you explicitly say ' hotly debated topic ' and i think that avoids obvious reductio ad absurdum arguments ( most people are single issue voters in that they would n't vote for someone who wanted to immediately nuke every other country even if they had great other policies ) . but there are some pretty dramatic differences between parties , and some individuals have good arguments that a particular issue matters far more than others and has a clear right position ( e.g. on this thread the case is made for climate change as a rational single issue ) if a reasonable chunk of the population can realistically make politicians know that they 'll only vote for a party that promises x , then this creates more pressure to do x than if they say it 's just one factor amongst many . for instance , here in the uk , the 2015 election saw the uk independence party ( anti-eu ) get 12.6 % of the vote , up from only 3.1 % in 2010 . the pressure of the rise of ukip seems likely to be part of the reason a referendum was held and we 're leaving the eu . so even though that huge swing got them no more mps ( because of first past the post ) it got movement on an issue that otherwise would have remained where it was . ukip voters were clearly being tactically single issue : after the referendum there was another election in 2017 where both main parties committed to brexit , and their vote plummetted down to 1.8 % . sometimes single issue voting is a matter of life and death . for transgender and intersex people , the trump administration is proposing to legislate them out of legal existence . this pretty much puts 100 % value on just this single issue , you ca n't care about anything else if you literally are n't allowed to exist ! your argument assumes that nobody actually has an informed opinion on abortion , weed , healthcare , etc. , and that our opinions are arrived at purely due to the manipulation of political strategists and special interest groups . since it 's possible that some people do have informed opinions that are based on information that does not rely on special interest groups and political strategists , you ca n't conclude that if somebody is a single issue voter that they are necessarily being manipulated by special interests groups or political strategists . most of the laws and bills being passed in general have no effect on most people , but there are a few issues such as healthcare , gun laws , abortion and even weed that play an important role in many individuals lives . 99 % percent of what politicians will do will have no effect on their life , with the exception to legalizing weed if they are in an illegal state . not voting on that single issue would be deliberately ignoring their own interests . if i believe the sanctity of life matters and that all life possesses inherent value , how do you convince me to vote for what i find morally abhorrent ? and i get how , as an ( i assume ) american in a 2 party system , it would look that way but here in canada a the most recent federal government won largely thanks to 2 blocks of single issue voters . we have legal weed now and the people who voted for the liberals based on that promise are probably going to keep voting for them in the future . on the other hand , the vote reform block ( my single issue last election ) got screwed . the government almost immediately went back on that campaign promise and has guaranteed they are n't going to implement it ... i am never going to vote for that party again unless they 're the only option to block something i 'm more afraid of or find completely unacceptable . and i certainly wo n't vote for them again on the grounds of a "" vote reform "" promise because i know they 're lying . the point is , the government implemented legalization regardless of it being a "" single issue "" vote and refused to implement vote reform because they think the short term loss of votes will cost them less than vote reform will . but single issue voters in my country absolutely did not lead to the situation you described and will absolutely have repercussions that do n't line up with the strategy you outlined . the other thing is that i think you 're actually discussing a strawman version of single issue voters . when i voted last election on the single issue that i did it was predicated on the assumption that none of the parties were presenting platforms so abhorrent that i could n't accept them . i 'm sure even the climate change guy downthread would pass the "" single issue "" party if they packaged climate change reform with enslavement and torture of all citizens . nobody actually thinks "" this is literally the only issue that matters "" . they just think that none of the other issues that the parties are running on matter as much so they can safely vote for whatever parties props up their one issue because the other issues do n't super matter . another version of the single party voter is someone who says "" i do n't understand most of the issues and do n't have time to understand them well enough to be informed . but i understand this issue that i know i care about very well , so that 's the one i 'm going to vote for . "" this strategy is predicated on the assumption that no completely insane party can win because other people , who are informed about the other issues , will vote them down . if we all vote for the issues we understand , and every important issue is important to a lot of people , parties will need to have good platforms on every issue . nobody is actually a "" single issue voter "" in the sense that they will tolerate anything as long as its packaged with their pet issue . saying you 're a single issue voter comes with an unspoken caveat of "" i do n't foresee any political party i might be asked to vote for bringing up a platform so much more utterly abhorrent than their competition that it could outweigh this one issue "" . you 're saying "" i assume the parties are , outside of a few key issues , mostly the same , and they wo n't do anything that vastly affects my way of life "" or you 're saying "" i do n't understand the issues well enough to be informed on every single issue so i 'm only going to vote based on the one i do know i 'm sufficiently informed on "" you 're placing your trust in the rest of the voting public who do n't share your single issue opinion that they 'll keep the rest of the parties ' platforms sane . mitigating climate change will save hundreds of millions of lives . when i assign weights to each issue , to determine how much each issue bears on my vote , hundreds of millions of potential deaths outweigh literally everything else . so , mitigating climate change has the same effect as literally 400 years of obamacare . so , if i have to choose between a candidate who wants to expand healthcare or mitigate climate change , i choose climate change . easily . given that this single issue necessarily is weighted so heavily , i hardly think i 'm being irrational by being a single-issue voter . single issue can be influenced by organizations , but it can also be a rationally-held belief independent of any organization . i do n't like infringements on rights , be it abortion , gay marriage , or guns . i do know that michael bloomberg has funded a couple astroturf organizations with tens of millions of dollars to do exactly what you 're talking about , convince people to take his position and elect his politicians ."
9qrni5,"when talking about victims of the holocaust , it is ignorant and racist to condemn it because of the deaths of 6 million jews . when the holocaust comes up in conversation , people immediately throw around the number "" 6 million jews "" when talking about the victims . others will echo the number and talk about the horrors of the death camps and what it must have been like to be a jewish person there , and also , is n't it horrible that 6 million jews died in the camps ? apparently the 5 million non-jews who died are not worth mentioning . apparently they do n't matter . fact is , approximately 11-12 million people died in hitler 's death camps . if you 're talking about the horrors of the holocaust and you only mention the 6 million jewish victims , you are spitting on the graves of the other 5-6 million people who were every bit as human but not jewish . imagine a plane goes down and the newscaster says "" horror in the skies ! plane crashes and 87 white passengers die ! "" would n't you say "" wtf ? why are they only talking about the white passengers ? do n't the other passengers matter ? are n't they worth mentioning ? ""","it 's wrong to focus just on the 6 million jews . what matters more is that 6 million jews represented ~ 40 % of the world population of jews . imagine that a plane crashed and among the victims was an entirety of a soccer team . the only reason we talk about the holocaust is because jews died . if it had been any other group of people who had been targeted it would have just been another atrocious act like the homodor or the cambodian killing fields . no other genocide in history gets dozens of movies or entire museums dedicated to them ( in countries that helped end the holocaust mind you ) because they do n't have a concentrated effort to put them into the spotlight by hollywood and the education system . 6 million jews were killed in the holocaust out of around 11-12 million in total . emphasis is put on the 6 million jews because hitler did not kill indiscriminately - it was an attempted genocide . 50 % of europe ’s population is not jewish , jews were hugely over represented as holocaust victims ( duh ) . police violence against african americans is a problem because it disproportionately affects them , and is clearly racially motivated even though other groups are killed by the police . while the holocaust did also target roma , gay and disabled people it primarily killed jewish people and that ’s why we talk about it in terms of 6 million jews . racist suggest that the speaker is aware of these other facts you cite and deliberately decides to focus only on jews rather than poles , lgbtq , roma or other persecuted groups . i would suggest applying hanlon 's razor and give people the benefit of the doubt that they know only the 6 million jews fact and not the other facts , rather than assuming racism or some other form of malice . the reason why jews are mentioned specifically with regards to the holocaust is because they were the primary target . extermination of european jews was an explicit goal of the nazi state , whereas many of the other deaths that can be lumped into the horrors of it were , sickeningly , somewhat incidental . the death of soviet citizens and pow 's for example , had a lot more to do with general wartime atrocities , starvation and slave labor than it does with the systematic , industrial murder we associate with concentration camps . likewise , the deaths in poland were horrific , but while the germans fully intended to enact a genocide in time , in the short term the majority of deaths were attributed again to things like starvation , or incidents such as the warsaw uprising . it certainly is n't fair to ignore the brutality towards the poles , or the roma , or any other group , but when people speak of the holocaust , they are most often colloquially speaking about the death camps , where 80-90 % of those killed were jewish . of the 3.3 million jews in poland , roughly 300,000 were still alive in 1945 , as just one example . what was done to other groups was horrific , but what was done to european jews was just shy of complete genocide . "" the holocaust "" is a specific term that refers to the systematic extermination of jews during wwii . those other people were killed , and deserve to be remembered , and are remembered as victims of nazi blood thirst , but when you are talking about the holocaust , you are by definition talking about the death of jews . when talking about the holocaust , people focus on the 6 million jews for several relevant reasons it 's evident they were the main target of the holocaust and deserve special recognition 2/3rds of european jews and 40 % of jews in the world were slaughtered . political opponents were the first victims of the nazis , they are n't directly victims of the holocaust other racial victims , fortunately , did n't have the casualty rates to put them on par with the jewish victims . the biggest is for the jews , but there are memorials for political victims , lgbt , roma and sinti and others . people can be ignorant , but non-racist who learn of the fact will quickly adapt their view of the holocaust . then they came for the trade unionists , and i did not speak out — because i was not a trade unionist . then they came for the jews , and i did not speak out — because i was not a jew . though it is the largest genocide , i always found it interesting that we never mention other 20th century genocides . combined , the genocides in soviet russia killed more than the holocaust . i 'm not trying to say we should n't talk about the holocaust , i 'm more saying we should give equal treatment to these atrocities . people condemn the holocaust because it killed millions of innocent people , especially jews . it is not a matter of we want to forget all about the victims , it is a matter about that the holocaust was a horrible , terrible , and awful event that happened in history since it just killed so many people . by condemning it , we show that we do n't ever want an event like that to happen again . a ) ignorant of the True extent of the holocaust ( e.g. , they only went after the jews ) . b ) aware of the full extent of holocaust , yet only seems to care about the jewish bodycount because they 're "" racist "" against the countless others who had their lives cut short by the nazis . granting upfront that the holocaust means the entirety of the genocide , i agree that it can be ignorant to not mention the others that died , but to say it is racist is absurd imo . if ignorance is the reason someone fails to mention the other people who died , then they just do n't know enough about the event . in areas like poland , the baltic states , germany , etc. about 90 % of the jewish population was killed . so , no , it 's not racist to refer to the holocaust as only of the jewish population . however , that said , i do think that society as a whole using the term holocaust generically to refer , incorrectly , to the larger nazi slaughter machine is ignorant and ignores the scores of others that were exterminated , including those who where disabled . among the first groups targeted for execution were the roma ( gypsy ) and disabled communities because more people would turn a blind eye to those atrocities . overall , you 're arguing the wrong thing : the holocaust was the systematic murder of the jewish people . however , especially in this day-and-age where we are seeing the dehumanizing of specific groups in a targeted way , it 's important that we stop the misuse of the term the holocaust and recognize the wider victim base of the nazi extermination machine . if we do n't recognize the parallels to history , we 're going to end up with the same murder machine in place . jewish people are singled out because they were literally the target of the holocaust . hitler 's motivation was to exterminate the jews . he was just a horrible enough person to kill 5 million more people in the process . if that plane in your example had been bombed out of the sky by someone who was trying to kill all the white people they could find , then it would make sense to mention that 87 white people were on board ."

state will impose it 's will on you . as for your decision not to vote , i am not sure how that supports your premise , so i do n't have a response . if your definition is any laws with threat of violence , then the definition of liberty or libertarian could also be seen as any activity that is void of governmental oversight/threat of violence . basically no country in existence as been absolute in authoritarian or libertarian , they are all on a spectrum and the dividing line between is not well defined , but like porn “ we know it when we see it ” . for me , a king is a lifetime appointment , given through force or inherited by birthright , who both is the leader and is the law . by this definition our president is far from a king , or emperor , or dictator . passing laws to dictate or shape how a citizenry act is not authoritarian , it 's how the society dictates the social contract . in other words , elected officials say that you , as a citizen , can go this far and no further in your free actions . pre-civil rights act , it was socially acceptable to discriminate against someone based on skin color , whereas in the post , the societal contract changed and that behavior is no longer considered acceptable . if the u.s. was truly an authoritarian society , those changes would have not taken place , because the powers that be would have shut the dissent down immediately . furthermore , the normalization , acceptance or reverence for things that go against the social contract would not be allowed , especially in the culture . we even have elected officials campaigning with videos of them endorsing or using marijuana . in a truly authoritarian society , these things would not be allowed , because they would sway the populace away from the state dictated program of behavior . the fact that legal weed is beginning to happen on a state level before the federal level is largely in part to the citizenry of those states electing pro-pot candidates . it also disproves , again , the authoritarian theory that you have , because if True , the federal system would have overrode the states and kept it illegal in spite of the local voters . as far as the president being able to use military power without checks or balances , understand that this is a relatively new problem that came about with the atomic era and one that the founders could not have predicted or prepared for . if the authoriatrian issues you speak of truly came about with the repeal of the aoc , then the president should have had unbalanced power from that point on , yet before

9qrata,"harvard getting sued over discriminatory admissions criteria is a good thing and will serve to create a precedent for more fair practices in the future because race should not now or ever be a part of admissions criteria . from my understanding , here 's what 's happening : harvard is being sued by a group of asian-americans because they feel that the university weighted race too heavily during their admissions criteria effectively discriminating against students because of their race . whether or not they 're right , i do n't know . but what i 'm arguing is that if two equally qualified students come to you and you disqualify one of them because they were born in a different place or the color of their skin , you are a racist . affirmative action was initially created to make things more fair . because black and other minority students tended to come from backgrounds that were non-conducive to learning the argument was that they should be given a little more weight because of the problems they would have had to face that white students may not have . but it is my belief that while the idea for this policy arose from a good place our society has changed and we need to think about whether we 've begun hurting others in our attempt to help some . ( [ -- url -- ) ) i propose that all admissions should be completely race-blind and that any affirmative action that needs to be applied should be applied based on family income rather than race . in fact , there is no reason that the college admissions process is n't completely student blind also . back when i applied to college ( four years ago ) , we had a commonapp within which i filled in all of my activites , my act , ap scores , and gpa . all of my school transcripts , letters of rec , and anything else got uploaded straight to the commonapp by my school . there was even a portion for a personal statement . it even included my name and other identifying information ( age , race , etc ) so there was no information about me in there that any admissions committee would feel was inadequate to making a decision . so why not just eliminate the whole identifying information bit . ask me for anything you need to know about why i want to go to college , where i come from , who i am , but know nothing else about me . this way if i feel that my being the child of immigrants is important it can go in my personal statement or if i felt that my being a boxer was that can or maybe both . but without knowing my race it can neither help nor hurt me . if affirmative action is applied based purely on how much money your family has then we can very fairly apply it to people who did not have the same advantages as others growing up and may have had to work harder without access to resources without discriminating against people who did n't have those things but were unfortunate enough to be born the wrong race . this way rich black people are not still considered more disadvantaged than poor asians . but poor black people and poor white people or poor asians or anything else will still be considered equal to each other . & #x200b ;","racism is rooted in historical fact , and it ’s impact can be currently demonstrated by objective metrics , such as income , unemployment , academic achievement , etc . affirmative action was implemented to address the specific historical injustice perpetrated on black americans , and specifically allow them to access institutions from which they ’d been banned . removing it as a preferentially treated criteria risks us taking a step backward towards institutions that admit very small numbers of blacks . now it ’s also a problem that poor students , regardless of race , face significant hurdles that wealthier ones do n’t . ditto students from families where no one has been to college . i ’m not against including these criteria , but it does n’t change the need or reasoning behind affirmative action . here 's where you 're wrong : equating this case to affirmative action in the first place . the civil rights act of 1964 prevents discrimination of race basically by any entity receiving federal funds ( harvard receives a staggering amount btw ) . affirmative action in education started in earnest in the late 1960s . since then , several supreme court cases have upheld affirmative action as essentially an exception to cra '64 but sought to contain it with three main precedents over several supreme court rulings : 1 . only used to maintain diversity as a last resort after trying every other method ( most recent precedent ) . whether you love it or hate it - until the supreme court reverses it - affirmative action is l-e-g-a-l as long as these precedents are met . that 's why the plaintiffs specifically stated this case is n't about aa and the defendants specifically backed down from comparing the relatively high asian population at harvard compared to the general us population . thus , harvard will not lose and a "" precedent for more fair practices "" will not happen . for example , after harvard learned about the pending sffa lawsuit in 2014 , they created a committee to "" consider "" policies that increase diversity without aa . the committee had only a few meetings in secret and produced no written report . in the lawsuit , they claim that this proves they tried other methods and satisfied precedent 3 . you seem to misunderstand the goal and history of affirmative action . the goal is not even to benefit the "" recipients "" of affirmative action . bussing is moving minorities from segregated neighborhoods into white schools . affirmative action is n't charity to those involved and it is n't supposed to be a sober look at the effect of bussing on the kids who were sent to schools with a class that hated them asked that it was n't a charity . evidence shows that students who are pulled into colleges in which they are underrepresented puts them off balance and often has bad outcomes for those individuals . firstly , i strongly oppose affirmative action because it 's racist at its core . so , i just want to point out that non-discrimination in a capitalist society by default favors a certain group of people - the group in power . in many cases , enforcing a color-blind merit test is actually a very good way to discriminate . a bunch of racist white politicians in the 1920s required everyone to pass a literacy test in order to vote . well , it turns out that the vast majority of the people who could pass this test were white , and well-read black people who could pass it were very very few and far between . there were very few schools which accepted black kids and very few ways black people could get access to these schools even if they were allowed to attend , because transportation is a lot more expensive back then . as a result , almost all the politicians elected were white and focused on oppressing black people more , not less . there was no racism in the test , there was just a disparity in the population that made it a really effective tool to segregate people . affirmative action ( and other scholarship programs ) are one of the tools we have to correct this issue . we 'd pretty much have asian and white kids in every high level university and black and hispanic kids in all the lowest levels of education . yes , it would be merit based , but the end result would be all the best colleges went to a few groups and the rest get the leftovers . positive discrimination from affirmative action is not a very good answer , i agree . i think affirmative action is a pretty horrible solution , i just think it 's far better than doing nothing at all . that is , does your race affect the way people in society treat you or affect the opportunities you are afforded ? for example , given two runners with equal 1 mile times , who is more impressive : the one with the resources to have a personal trainer , who ate optimal meals , and had a schedule built around training ; or the person who woke up early to train on their own every morning , in between working a job and taking care of their family . surely the biggest issue with this kind of system is that harvard is able to see this information in the first place , whereas it should probably actually be a completely blind test with no personal information , just grades ? i do n't think just suing harvard for this kind of thing is really doing very much to tackle the major issue that is of importance here . i think that harvard , and any other college sees this as a quotas kind of deal and will probably see this as a different quotas kind of deal . i think the only real way to ensure that there is a pool of candidates who are genuinely worthy of the cause is to make everyone sit the same exams and simply pick out the best ones and where there are lots of people who are all about the same , just pick them out of a hat . while there are lots of places that want the best for their students , there are the likes of oxford and cambridge and yale and harvard which would like to keep the privileged in their positions of privilege . suppose that we ( through some magical means ) had the ability to compare two different admissions methods side-by-side . one of the things that 's happening is that different people have different ideas about the role that universities are supposed to play . so , on some level , you probably want admission standards that help you ( or people like you ) get in . someone else might see universities as institutions that shape society and would want to see admission policies that promote some social agenda . a third person sees the university as a business , and wants admissions policies to maximize profit . different people have different ideas about how qualified individual applicants are and different ideas about how to measure the university 's success , but if you start by talking about "" two equally qualified students "" you 're , more or less , already assuming that everyone agrees about how to decide whether people are qualified . but the point of affirmative action was to address a historical wrong against a specific group . okay , but how do you account for the disparities in opportunity that are directly related to race in the us , as a function of the history of this country . the problem is that black and latino people in the us have historically been discriminated against in terms of economic and educational opportunities . just deciding to ignore race now without any consideration for the effects of centuries of mistreatment ( and continued discrimination , even today ) on the baseline opportunity of these groups . either affirmative action occurs too much or too little or does n't consider certain minorities enough . race still seems to be quite a determining factor in terms of income groups . and also , within similar income groups , certain races still seemed to hold an advantage over others . someone posed the question as to whether we would be satisfied ( as people ) if certain prestigious spheres of life were dominated by certain groups . in my view , it 's a lot more beneficial to society to have more proportionate representation and to also ensure that disadvantaged groups are also treated in a manner so as to redress their disadvantages ."
9qr5w8,"only tax payers should be allowed to vote the u.s.a hello everyone , i am open to hearing reasons why the above is wrong , or exceptions to the above statement . i do not believe that it is in the public 's best interest to allow people who live in the united states who are not taxpayers or students to have the right to vote . by "" tax payer "" i mean someone who is over the age of 18 and is either paying income taxes and/or property taxes . this would not include sales tax . i would also say that anyone who is married to either a tax payer should have the right to vote as well , provided that they are a legal resident of the locality/state/country . i have been reading a lot about voter id laws , and it had me thinking whether it should be a right of people to vote , or a privilege . i feel that it is not a right , but a privilege to have your vote cast in government . the "" privileged "" class here would be those who are paying for the services provided by the government , with no exceptions . i do not believe that people should have the privilege to vote to elect politicians or government officials unless they are funding the institution of government which pays for those services .","the government has many compulsory asks of its citizens , and in exchange we are given the right to vote . unless you are insinuating that if i do n't pay taxes i should be off the hook for the above . the citizenry makes a lot of implicit sacrifices in order to have voting rights given to them . voting is one way that people can have a say in their government . sure sounds like a poll tax or a means test to me , which is illegal . even poor people fund the government through sales taxes and payroll taxes . also , theres an increasing number of working poor in america — the do n’t contribute to the economy through capital , but through labor , and their contribution is just as essential . this comes down to whether you think the government exists to serve the citizens of the citizens exists to serve the government . a disabled vet , a retired widower , a struggling artist , a private in the army , or a father of three working two minimum wage are all part of society . the value they are currently adding to society is hard to calculate , but they are unquestionably part of it . all of them would fall below the threshold for paying income tax , but they all do any should have the right to vote if you think the role of the state is to represent to interests of the citizens . your criteria gives the government primacy over the citizens since the criteria to vote depends not on what you contribute to society , but what you contribute to the government . one point that might not have been clear is that a lot of working people do n't earn enough to get above the minimum amount required to pay taxes . a lot of these people are in fact contributing a great deal to society and should certainly have a say in how it is governed . government laws affect more than the productive members that pay income tax . parents that are stay at home providers , people on disability , people in college w/o jobs , retired citizens , etc. are all still affected by zoning laws , sales tax increases , public transportation/libraries/schools , healthcare related laws , gun laws , hunting laws , emission laws , trade policies , laws surrounding death/assets/burial , minimum/mandatory consequences for minor violations , etc . not to mention the fact that they would be responsible for creating the tax system that decides who can and can not vote . do you also believe that people who do not pay taxes should be exempt from police services , or fire fighters ? low income workers like janitors keep the cogs of society running , but make so little that they qualify for 0 income tax , and often have to use welfare to make ends meet despite already working . do n't you think they deserve a voice given how much they toil , often dealing with a lot of blatant disrespect from upper classes , to keep our society running ? that 's seems very wrong if you think voting should be entirely determined by how much taxes you pay . if you deny this right to people who do n’t pay income or property tax , you ’re placing a barrier between them and their rights that is now mediated by third parties . \ > i do not believe that people should have the privilege to vote to elect politicians or government officials unless they are funding the institution of government which pays for those services . sales tax pays for those services as well - maybe not on the federal level but on the state level in a lot of ways . and while we 're at it , renters sort of pay property tax - in that their rents reflect those taxes . what incentive is there to create programmes that help the unemployed and disabled get back on their feet or the help they need if politicians do n't have to care about them ? the idea that voting is a privilege gets the relationship between people and governments fundamentally backwards . when you cast a vote , that 's not a luxury that the government extends to you . it 's the means by which you give the government the right to rule ."
9qpz8x,"the pregnancy discrimination act of 1978 should be changed to only protect current employees and not potential ones . in 1978 , the united states passed the pregnancy discrimination act which basically created a new classification of protected class to include women who are medically pregnant . this law makes it illegal for an employer ( or potential employer ) to discriminate against the woman for being pregnant . for the sake of this cmv , i will focus more on potential employers instead of current ones . it seems absolutely insane to me that companies are not allowed to "" not hire "" an applicant based on the fact that they are pregnant . if i am a business owner , and i am hiring for a position , why is it in the best interest of my business to hire someone who will require 12 to 26 weeks of leave within the next nine months ? if i already have multiple employees that are going to be on leave due to child birth , and i am hiring a person to cover while we would be shorthanded , why would i be forced to hire someone who will need the same duration off as the workers i am already trying to cover for ? also , it sure seems like a terrible way to start off with a company , basically hiding that you are pregnant during an interview , or refusing to answer that question . completely shattering any semblance of trust is not a good "" foot in "" to a career . so , say i hire someone to run the front desk of my ice cream stand . on the very first day , they tell me they are pregnant . now i am automatically on a clock . i must now hire a second person and train them to do the exact same job for when my new hire will be taking 12 to 26 weeks of leave . so now i am having to pay wages/benefits/ect for two people instead of one , costing the business double . when the time comes , the first hire goes on 12 weeks of leave , and i have someone there to do the same job , and is able to show up to work every day . after the 12 to 26 weeks is up , i must give the first hire the job back , and let the second "" reliable "" employee go or find other work for them to do . how is this fair to the business , and how is this fair to the second hire who was able to do the job they hired on to do reliably ? in my opinion , this law needs to be changed to only reflect current employees , and not potential employees for the exact reasoning i wrote above . why should a potential employer have massive expanded costs and needless frustration and hassle , when they could hire a reliable employee instead , and not have to worry about all of this ? i understand that everyone needs equal opportunity to find employment , but that should also be expanded to the employer as well to find the best employee for the job they are able . it seems like this law actively sabotages the ability to do this . cmv ( resubmitted to add more info to the title and not break the rules )","but if nobody is allow to discriminate based on a pregnancy , then you can hire pregnant women without being at a disadvantage . besides that , i 'm pretty sure there are exemptions for small businesses which would n't survive hiring a people who need 3 months off in the short term . it does n't make it hard for a business to compete when all their competitors have the same burdens . also plenty of women do n't know if they are pregnant or if they do know if they are pregnant whether or not they will carry it to term , plenty might miscarry or decide to get an abortion if something goes wrong in their relationship even if they were previous planning on having it . it is , however , in our collective best interest to allow the half of the population that births new people to be full participants in the world -- including working and having careers . but when a woman starts a family , more often than not , she carries and delivers a baby and then physically recovers from the birth . there 's no way around it , and she should n't be punished for it by making it more difficult to have a job . it 's morally wrong to ask people to choose between being a parent and having a career , and bad for society besides . just for clarification , you are only referring to potential employees that are pregnant not ones that are likely to become pregnant . okay , so i understand that you want to say that companies seeking employees should be allowed to refuse as candidates women who are presently pregnant . there are loads of things a candidate employee might hold as private , and which it would be inappropriate for an employer to seek to know . there are likewise loads of activities available for a person which might cause them to be unable to continue to work for extended periods of time , which are neither things to which an employer should be privy , nor things an employer should be entitled to restrict , nor even things against which an employer should be able to discriminate . driving a car , skiing , cycling , skydiving , and all manner of other pursuits are activities . these sometimes result in broken bones or medically necessary surgeries , etc. , which can result in missed work for extended periods of time , or reduced ability to work , etc . i think you have to say ' yes ' in order to remain consistent , but that would have drastic consequences , and it is entirely untenable , meaning your position reduces to an argument that discrimination specifically against women who are observed to be pregnant , which is completely incompatible with free society and anti-discrimination efforts . you also argue that employers who hire pregnant women suffer unduly from the expectation of missed time and sunk training costs . for one , it ignores the fact that any new hire might leave despite perfect health , perfect attendance , and perfect performance -- employers take this chance whenever they seek to hire someone . for two , it ignores the fact that any new hire might be a terrible employee and be appropriately terminated -- employers also take this chance whenever they seek to hire someone . for three , it ignores the fact that something could befall any employee at any moment which would result in an extended leave of absence or voluntary termination -- emoloyers must contend with this for any employee . so employers do not suffer unduly as they can not predict the future and can not control their employees ' activities or outcomes , whether new hires or tenured . this all means that your position relies on the observation of a pregnancy , and that is textbook discrimination ( and it is sometimes erroneous ) . beyond all this , a woman who is pregnant may not know she is pregnant , and this strongly suggests that she has done no wrong in applying for a position and that her employer will have done wrong in requiring a pregnancy test . add to this the unfortunate fact that many pregnancies end in miscarriage , and the worry you seem to have is itself reduced . so your view seems to be oddly specific in endorsing discrimination against women , and specifically against women who are observed to be pregnant , while ignoring the fact that the same concerns should be reasonably present for virtually any prospective hire , and your view seems to hinge on the observation itself , which is an affront to anti-discrimination ideals . i might have a scheduled surgery as a result of my lack of skill on the mountain slopes , but if an employer can not directly recognize this and it is not disclosed , i suppose your view is that my choices are protected . your view is also oddly positioned in favor of employers by pretending that the costs associated with temporary replacement of pregnant hires is significant when compared against attrition rates or failed hire rates . so your view is exposed as specifically singling out women and ignoring a virtually unlimited list of ' risky ' behaviors available to candidate employees , or undisclosed circumstances ranging from accessibility needs to religious accommodations to medical concerns to i do n't even know , but somehow those remain protected while an observation -- an assumption -- concerning pregnancy is not . prospective employers have zero right to know whether a candidate is pregnant , especially where the candidate herself is unaware of an active pregnancy . prospective employers have zero right to know whether a candidate employee has any scheduled surgery , necessary leave of absence , etc. , which is not otherwise legally required to be disclosed . prospective employers assume many risks with respect to the outcomes of hires , including injuries , illnesses , incarceration due to criminal activity , death , etc. , which may occur with any candidate employee . prospective employers assume many other risks with respect to the outcomes of hires , including but not limited to a new hire who receives a better offer elsewhere , general attrition , or behavior/skill assessments incompatible with the position 's requirements which result in appropriate termination . employees generally have little or no protections anyway , as businesses can and unfortunately often do make hiring decisions which are premature , resulting in termination or layoff , so unless you propose some two-way contract your position quite unfairly advantages employers , or at least very specifically disadvantages women . women who lose their jobs essentially wo n't be able to find a proper new job for up to 9 months until their child is born and they 're out of medical care . the law is there because it should be more important to protect pregnant women and pregnancy than it is for you to maintain a job as a business owner . you 're coming from the perspective of a small business and that stance is understandable , but hiring and training someone is not a huge deal in the scheme of things . most businesses will do that multiple times over the course of their lifetime , for multiple people , to the point that its interchangeable . and also to be honest , your one single small business is not so important that the hardship of hiring another person is going to make or break you . on the other hand , if we allow pregnancy discrimination , that takes out almost half the workforce . people will not want to hire women of certain ages so they do n't have to risk pregnancy . individually , a pregnancy is life-changing unlike a business training a new hire . most people who do have kids have just a few . if they are discouraged from doing so , it has more impact on them than a business would hiring and training a dozen people . if it were in your own best interests we could assume you would do it without threat of force from the government . it is , however , in the peoples best interest for pregnant women to be able to find a job . since it 's in the peoples interest and not in the businesses interest , the people banded together to get the government to act on their behalf . because your business is part of a society and you need to do your part to contribute . children ( produced by pregnant women ) are literally the future of our society . it makes a lot of sense for society to make sure that pregnant women are not discriminated against to secure its own future ."
9qplbs,"making election day in the united states a federal holiday wo n't make a dramatic change in voter turnout . i recently had this discussion with a group of people and it was an interesting debate . some see the current election date as a form of voter suppression . they stated multiple times that making election day a federal holiday would allow more to vote , in a way that would make a significant impact . i , however , do n't see it making much of an impact . looking at a list of federal holidays , and comparing it to industries where people might not be able to afford to take the time off to vote , or those who simply can not vote for whatever reasons due to timing , would not matter much . for example , many people in the food service industry would still have to work . restaurants do n't close on columbus day , labor day , memorial day , etc . same goes for people in plenty of other sectors . hell , just because something is a holiday does n't mean it 's easier at all . look at retail workers with labor day sales , black friday/thanksgiving sales , memorial day sales , etc . essentially , the only people who are typically impacted by federal holidays are those who are working for the government ( or a bank ) .","and nonvoters are 40 % of the country during presidential elections . only 10 % of the us ' jobs - 14.7 million employees , and many restaurants would close or have reduced hours to allow people to vote . so that 's another 3.2 % , assuming literally everyone works and does n't vote that day . nope , 70 % of america is a service economy , and with the exception of online and order fulfillment , they take off on christmas day , veteran 's day , fourth of july , etc . finally , you 're ignoring that making something a holiday with the relevant name literally causes people to become aware of that event simply by recognizing the event 's name and date . the idea would not be to just make it a holiday . it would be to also build culture around it to make it into a hard holiday ( like christmas . ) there was a similar thread about this a while ago that made me think about this and actually change my view - a one day holiday is not enough , you are correct . i think we need to expand voting to two days and mandate no employee may be scheduled for both days , barring reasonable exceptions ( which would include 0 retail situations ) i actually think it would make a significant change ( probably a single digit percent change , not sure if you want to call it "" dramatic "" or not ) , but it would be a decrease , not an increase . people do n't mind taking time away from work to vote and most employers are pretty accommodating to voting or are required by law to be accommodating . by making election day a holiday , voting would be competing with a day of leisure , not leaving the office early . especially once retailers try to use the day as a major shopping day to get a jump on black friday and the nfl starts scheduling a full slate of games that day , etc . what if we were to make it the kind of national holiday where it was required that everyone be given time off . while i agree that just making election day a civic holiday would have minimal effect , i think the general idea behind it does work and the problems can be circumvented . for example , while it is n't technically a "" holiday "" , in my country employers are legally required to give employees at least 3 hours off from their normal hours on voting day so they have time to get to the polls and back . this applies to every job so even though every store that would be open that day is still open , everyone gets time off to vote . companies just need to book extra staff that day to cover the gaps . implementing this psuedo-holiday ( or making it a full holiday and then putting limits on how many hours you can make someone work during that holiday ) would alleviate the concerns you 're raising . napkin math time ! according to this pew survey , 14 % of registered voters who did n't vote in the 2016 election said their reason for not doing so was because they "" were too busy or had a conflicting work or school schedule . "" it 's not a great question , since it does n't only address work or school conflicts , but it gives you an idea of why people say they could n't make it to vote . while the private sector does n't need to give the 10 national holidays off , on average private sector workers still get 7.6 of those days off . that does n't count the government workers who do get those off , but to simplify the numbers , let 's just say 76 % of the workforce would get the day off . voting turnout was estimated to be 55.5 % in 2016 , with around 250 million potentially eligible voters , but only 138 million votes counted . so let 's pretend there were 62 million registered voters who did n't vote . of those , 14 % ( 8.68 ) did n't vote due to conflicts with work or school . if this was a national holiday , 76 % would n't have that conflict . one of the biggest issues with voting turnout is voter suppression . the voting rights act was struck down a few years ago , and in the states in which it was no longer effective there were policies put in place to lower access to voting . one of the most popular methods is to simply limit the number of polling locations available — by requiring that people take more time out of their day to commute to a polling location ( especially those who do n’t have their own car or other form of transportation ) , people who have to work have a more difficult time getting to the polls . by making it a national holiday that required every employee have an equitable opportunity to vote , voter suppression would largely be limited and we would see significant changes in access to the polls . it could also encourage people to go vote if there was a worry that the national holiday would be discontinued if voting numbers did n’t increase !"
9qp37e,"kashoggi murder was premeditated and carried out with saudi government approval it was obviously pre-meditated and planned with the intention that they may kill him . we know it was pre-meditated because one of the operatives had a bone saw in his luggage . this may have only been in case kashoggi did not agree to fly back to saudi with the operatives , but they still had the possibility in mind . he could not have died in a "" fist fight "" because a body double left the consulate wearing kashoggi 's glasses and clothes . if there was a fist fight , his glasses would 've been broken and there would 've been blood on his clothes . them being rogue operatives would be a stretch . rogue meaning that the prince did n't know about it ? possible . rogue meaning that no one in the government knew about it ? impossible . these operatives had the ability to clear out the consulate of employees , retrieve the security tapes , and then subsequently clean up and repaint the place after they were done . all of this would require the ambassador 's approval , who would require high level government approval . my theory is that they invited kashoggi to the consulate , tried to coerce him into flying to saudi , and when he said no they killed him and disposed of his body . they then sent a body double out the back door hoping that would suffice in removing the trail from their doorstep . there 's almost no denying that this is what happened , the question is whether the prince knew about it beforehand . unless you can change my view .","first off , as has been shown by how quickly news of the murder emerged , killing khashoggi in the embassy was an absolutely terrible idea . by using this location , it makes it all but impossible for the saudis to claim the murder was n't government approved , for some of the logistical reasons you mentioned ( clearing out embassy staff , clearing footage , etc. ) . secondly , the embassy was the location most likely to be under turkish surveillance , which the saudis would have also known . as such , by killing khashoggi there they opened themselves up for the greatest risk of hard evidence being recorded to conclusively show their criminal acts . when taken together , this inclines me to believe that the agents may not have originally wanted to kill khashoggi at the embassy , given that this location is an unambiguously bad place to do so . in addition to the embassy being an unsuitable location for murder , i would also argue that the presence of a saudi body double lends further credence to the notion that khashoggi was n't supposed to be immediately killed . if the saudi plan was to kill khashoggi in the embassy , bringing a double does n't make a whole lot of sense , as footage of the double probably would n't convince turkish intelligence/police officers that the reporter was still alive . however , if the plan was to first kidnap khashoggi , having a double would be of more use . by showing footage of a man who could be mistaken for khashoggi leaving the embassy , the saudi agents could have bought valuable time while moving him to a more secure secondary location , or even out of the country . importantly , the time buying/plausible deniability promoting utility of a body double only works if the initial murder goes undetected , which again the saudis would have know was least likely in the embassy . next , moving away from hard facts and into the realm of geopolitics , killing khashoggi outright does n't make a whole lot of sense . the brazen nature of this murder creates a narrative which makes that saudi government look terrible and which makes it politically easy for other nations to condemn the saudis . furthermore , it creates increased attention which only further limits that saudi 's ability to clamp down on political opposition and the free press . as a result , the saudis come out of this crime having made a small gain , silencing one key opposition journalist , but they lost far more as a result , with their international prestige crumbling and sanctions becoming a distinct possibility . my best guess is that they wanted to kidnap khashoggi , force him to confess to crimes against the saudi government under duress , and then bring him back to saudi arabia for a speedy show trial . in this scenario , murder is still very much on the table , but as a back-up plan if the forced confession or kidnapping fail . while this would have still drawn international criticism , being able to show film of khashoggi being "" convicted "" of a crime would have given the saudi government 's actions more validity within the country , while still sending a clear chilling message to journalists/political opponents . additionally , the saudis would have been able to push aside some criticism from other nations by claiming that attempts to stop the trial were in violation of their national sovereignty . although this likely would n't fool anyone into thinking khashoggi 's trial was legitimate , it would at least make criticizing the saudi government more of a politically delicate affair , especially for countries with similar histories of human rights abuses ( like russia ) . overall a show trial , or at least a murder committed in secret , would have been a far better outcome for the saudi government . in conclusion , while i think it 's clear that the saudis had nefarious intentions when it came to khashoggi , and were likely open to murdering him , i do n't think the embassy murder can be conclusively shown to have been premeditated . to the contrary , several elements of this case and the political calculus involved in such an action suggest that the saudis may well have not intended to kill khashoggi in their embassy . although we may never know the full story , lest someone from the saudi government steps forward , i think there 's enough uncertainty to cast doubt on your view that the embassy murder was completely premeditated ."
9qp2ej,"starship troopers does not promote fascism . perhaps the most widely misunderstood work of science fiction , starship troopers does not promote fascism . the film , which is what most people are probably familiar with , is hailed as a satirical critique of a fascist society that is fueled by war . this fundamental misunderstanding of the source material comes across as uninformed and intentionally misleading given that the original story ( book by robert heinlein ) espouses a radically liberal , albeit militaristic , worldview ; a society based on merit and service to society where those who serve and contribute are given a voice in how society is shaped . this is not a fascist perspective . the story is , however , a scathing critique of communism ( the bugs represent a communist society ) . certain plot points in the movie have been interpreted in such a way that paints the federation as the aggressor when in fact it was the bugs who made a pre-emptive strike against earth ( the meteor that wiped out buenos aires ) and instigated the first bug war . the federation was then forced into action upon learning that it now faced a threat hell-bent on destroying the human race . again , not fascist , but instead a justified retaliatory action meant to save the human race . people also often cite that civilians having to join military service was the only way to earn citizenship and the right to vote . another misunderstanding ; civilians could also serve in any civil service/office role to fulfill this requirement . it was not mandated that they be soldiers . again , the idea that people have to earn the right to vote and participate in the structuring of society is not an ideal rooted in fascism . these are the values of a liberal society based on merit and individual choice/freedom . no one was required to serve , but choosing to serve granted privileges that those who did not serve could not enjoy . i think these are the main examples that people use to frame this work as a promoter of fascism . cmv .","the complimentary description used by supporters of what enemies call a fascist society is pretty much what your described above . it was a society ruled by the military elite , which is a hallmark of fascism . even in wwii only 12 % of americans served . this means that a society where only military or government officeholders can vote is inherently anti-democratic . starship troopers is one of the easiest targets for satire because almost all fascists describe their society in the complimentary terms described above . meanwhile , political opponents would say that those parts of american society had a fascist worldview . if it 's confined to a handful of governments between wwi and wwii , then the book is n't promoting fascism . meanwhile supporters of this type of society do not want to consider themselves fascists so they do n't consider it a fascist book . maybe when he wrote it , it was n't that far outside the mainstream . but this book has become the standard for fascism today . it 's like how a foot could be a wide variety of sizes , but one day someone made a 12 inch ruler and called that a foot . today , if someone asked me to describe a fascist society , the one in starship troopers is the first one i think of . starship troopers would be anti-fascist because it is slightly less fascist than that society . but in relationship to mainstream american and especially european society today , the book represents and glorifies a fascist worldview . in his hands the question was a crusading journalist who confounded his enemies with his moral righteousness and by asking the questions no one wanted to answer . his worldview was additionally represented in treating blue beetle ( a guy who was a hero for financial motives ) as an uncomplicated hero , and captain atom ( superman , in effect , but motivated by explicit jingoism and nationalism ) . the adaptation is a critique ( and satirization ) of the original work . that 's not subtext , that 's text : in the world of the movie their society is explicitly one where democracy "" failed "" and "" veterans "" "" took control . "" a military coup occurred , which rewrote the rules of their society , and ensured that only people who supported their regime would be allowed to hold any power . notice , though , that the only source for that claim in the movie is the propaganda piece within the movie produced by the federation government . i ca n't speak for the book , but in the movie the basis for the claim that the meteor was fired by the bugs is dubious at best . in democratic societies the ability to vote is conferred by the act of being governed . "" fascism is a form of radical authoritarian ultranationalism , characterized by dictatorial power , forcible suppression of opposition and strong regimentation of society and of the economy "" ps : we also do heavy propaganda to every person in our all-white country "" is not dictatorial : no way for people to contradict laws without risking their life ( as you got no civil rights ) strong regimentation of economy : economy is mainly turned toward the army , and the army is managed by the state . the "" good guys "" in that movie serve a fascist government , which is portrayed as the good side in this war . any movie that portrays a fascist as a good guy kinda promotes fascism , even if only a little . it 's not just any service to society , only military service counts . a government ruled by the military is a junta , which is a form of fascism . the "" failure of democracy "" scene pretty explicitly is a criticism of fascism . coupled with the opening scene which was a shot for shot remake of a reifenstahl propoganda film it is impossible to claim that it is not a satire of fascism . before starship troppers the movie , he actually wanted to make a world war ii film , but the studio did n't want him to . so , instead he took heinlein 's starship troopers , in which he did see fascist parallels , and used it as a springboard for creating his own artistic vision and interpretation of the world . that does n't sound like he did n't understand heinlein 's work to me , just that he wanted to do his own thing and was n't able to and used the adaptation of starship troopers as a roundabout way of doing it . i do n’t think heinlein is by any means a fascist , but he inadvertently wrote a book with militaristic overtones . we should have seen some evidence in the book if that assertion is True , and heinlein even admitted he intended it to be in the book but was not . if you have any evidence to support your assertion that the book starship troopers gives franchisee for non-military service , i ’d be very interested in knowing where ( and i have the book so you can give pages and scenes ) . i 'd like to change your view on a nuance of your point while still agreeing with your overall point . two things stand out when the conversation turns to starship troopers and fascism : the symbol for fascism is several wooden rods bound tightly together so their combined strength can not be broken . and "" fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is a merger of state and corporate power . "" obviously the society and government presented in starship troopers is nothing like mussolini 's vision . and the corporate structure is certainly not married to the government ; otherwise rico 's dad would have been all about his son moving into that domain and thereby strengthening that marriage between his own corporation and the government . fascism can be many things but the fact that citizens had to participate in their society in a certain way in order to vote is the point ; the right to vote , considered quintessential in the west , was not considered a human right . how is being forced into civil service to earn the right to vote a good thing for a perspective that values individual choice ? i know it 's not wholly accurate , but i most often associate fascism with authoritarianism and absolute government control of society . i can see how someone could view the material as militaristic , but not fascist . i do n't want to get into the book , but the film is a clear critique of militarism and fascism . the attack on buenos aires was just the latest strike in an ongoing conflict that was already taking place ( as evidenced by the fact that virtually every adult rico encounters in the film has some obvious war wound like a missing limb ) . it 's clear from the film that humans are the aggressors , albeit kind of unintentionally - we invaded the bug territory while expanding and colonizing new planets . the bugs , like you 'd expect from a territorial animal , attacked us when did n't back down and leave , and that 's how the war started . from fandom wiki on the first bug war : "" during the course of the war apart from several meteor attacks on earth by the arachnids , it was the federation which was the aggressor invading deep into the arachnid quarantine zone until arachnid counter attacks defeated many federal invasions of their homeworlds . "" ) as far as the idea that the bugs represent communism , i have no idea where that comes from , and i do n't think there 's any evidence to support it in the movie . the federation is pretty clearly meant as a critique of fascisim and militarism . i think you can argue that the society in the film is n't strictly fascist , but there are definite connections being drawn with fascism , and it 's very clear the film is not advocating this kind of society as good or ideal . this is evidenced constantly , but some of the most obvious things that indicate to us that the film is not advocating human society should be like this : carl 's military intelligence uniform is quite clearly meant to evoke nazi uniforms the film ends with them cheering , not because they won the war or save humanity , but because their enemy - a now helpless and shivering bug - is afraid ."
9qoh52,"considering america 's current political and economic climate , inescapable child support laws are necessary to force people to take pregnancy prevention seriously . i understand and acknowledge that there are some people who get absolutely wrecked by child support cases , in particular cases where the child support payment amount was based on past earning levels that are now unachievable . i am not in support of keeping child support laws exactly as they are . this being said ... when it comes to pregnancy , there is an unavoidable cost to people with ovaries . either you miscarry ( something you have no control over , which can be medically dangerous if you do n't have access to good healthcare ) , you get an abortion ( which , depending on where you live and your current financial status , can be impossible or extremely difficult ) or you give birth , which is a potentially deadly process ; while we tend to think of death in childbirth as a thing that does n't happen anymore , the united states has a rising rate of death from childbirth complications . people with ovaries have a clear incentive to take pregnancy prevention seriously because the cost is so immediate and obvious . there is no such unavoidable cost for people with testes . there used to be social pressures that kept most people with testes from siring unwanted pregnancies left and right : the pressure to marry the mother of your unborn child ( which incidentally puts you in a position to support your child ) , the scandal of having sired a child out of wedlock that would make you lose your livelihood and social standing . but these pressures are nearly nonexistent in today 's america , and for good reason ! people who make good bedfellows do n't necessarily make good spouses , and a complete fall from grace for what may have been a single indiscretion is dispropotionate . but there has to be some kind of substitute for that pressure , because we know from historical experience that people with testes do not and have never cared about siring unwanted pregnancies and did not use contraceptives even when contraceptives were available . if we want to prevent as many unwanted pregnancies as possible , there has to be an incentive to prevent unwanted pregnancies or a disincentive to cause them . there is no other way to disincentivize causing an unwanted pregnancy rather than attaching an inescapable cost to one . people with ovaries have one built-in , but we need to create one for people with testes in order to make them even remotely equally invested in contraceptive efforts . now , are there idiots of all genital configurations who wo n't act sensibly regardless of the incentives/disincentives ? of course . but the majority of people will act in their own self-interest when there 's something this tangible on the line .","the current set up gives far more power to women and gives men almost nothing but responsibility . i 'm not saying men should n't have responsibility , but i 'm saying that the person with more power and control should have more responsibility and less assistance to make a more even power dynamic . as it stands now , female contraceptive fraud is ignored while stealthing is viewed as rape . this is justified by the fact that women have to suffer the consequences of pregnancy as if men are n't legally on the hook if a woman gets pregnant . if we take your hypothesis as True , then states with higher child support payments or regulation should have less child born to unwed mothers . the two states with the lowest rate of child support is maryland the state the highest is kansas the rate of pregnancy to unwed mother in maryland is 39.7 in kansas is 36 % . also there are several states like mississippi which has the highest rate of of unwed mother and a higher than average rate of child support payments . what about the disincentive whereby people with ovaries , aware of the costs and risks of pregnancy , refuse to have sex with anyone who does n't take the proper precautions to prevent an unwanted one ? this seems foolproof , as at that point , even if this is n't punishing enough for those with testes , no unwanted pregnancies can occur ( except as a result of rape , which should be taken very seriously , but that 's a different topic ) . it seems to be a matter of education more than regulation , and child support should be set only for the purpose of supporting a child . what do you see wrong with today 's child support laws that you would like changed , and what would you see as a possible alternative that would address your concerns better ? do n't worry , i do n't intend to be nit-picky and expect you to provide a perfectly written legal policy , but just an example of what specific kind of law you 'd think would better serve the purpose of incentivizing taking more preventative measures to avoid unwanted pregnancy ?"
9qn8jm,"trump has done nothing to deserve impeachment and has been one of the best presidents we 've had in a long time . i understand he is somewhat immature , but i can get past that and , honestly , in my opinion , he 's done more to better this country in his 2 years than our last 4 presidents did in their 8 . examples ? he moved the u.s. embassy in israel to jerusalem . he pulled us out of the iranian nuclear deal . he stood up to nato for not contributing enough money into their defense costs . he put an eye on corrupt and bias media outlets as well asput focus on illegal immigration . he 's created millions of new jobs and brought unemployment down to 3.9 % . he put a focus on the opiod crisis in the u.s. including the corrupt drug dealing doctors who push them for their own benefit . he pulled out of the paris agreement on climate change . he also put an end to daca , which in and of itself was unconstitutional amd illegal , even obama said so before he put it into action , illegally . i fully believe that donald trump has done more for the betterment of thos country in his two years than any of our last four presidents did in their eight years . sorry if this isnt the right sub for this , but i really wan na get my thoughts out there and couldnt find any other sub for it . i 'm friendly and open minded and just ask that anyone commenting grant me the same respect .","following the moving of the embassy several deaths happened during the protests . this is exactly why no other president has done this move , and why many other countries refuse to do the same . trump 's decision which went against his western allies and intelligence service lead to several deaths , and the violence is not closer to ending as more hard line palestinians have been empowered by the provocation . this move is long lasting as well because it will be hard for a future president to undo the damage . he change nothing all the countries had agreed to reach 2 percentage of gdp spent on defence in the near future , something they have all said they would do repeatedly . as a result , whereas there was a cohesive sanction administration under obama and bush , there 's now nothing to replace it . in fact , the european union ( traditionally a us ally ) is actively seeking to sabotage us attempts to create sanctions . so , trump has replaced a deal which restricted the iranian nuclear program with a sanction regime which does n't do anything . the nato 2 % commitment is by 2024 , so nato members are n't breaking their commitment . in addition , trump has done nothing relevant here . he made a bunch of noise , but has brought about 0 policy changes , 0 commitments and a negative amount of goodwill . a raw jobs comparison is also not a great , because the president is n't in absolute control of the economy . what makes you think that moving the u.s. embassy to jerusalem and pulling you out of the iranian nuclear deal is a move to ' better ' the nation ? for example , pulling out of the iranian nuclear deal empowers hardliners in iran . it is still early in trump 's presidency , and while the unemployment rate has decreased by 1 percentage point during his reign , it decreased by about 4 percentage points during the previous president 's reign . furthermore , you say that he ' put an eye ' on ' corrupt and biased ' news media . and furthermore , if they are corrupt , should n't he have encouraged the branches of government under his control or ask for legislation to fight such corruption ? but are n't all types of news media biased because they have to have a lens to see the news through ? so basically i am arguing that ' bias ' in news media is n't something to be wary of as long as it does not degenerate to ' falsification . ' the president can set policies with some influence , e.g. tax rates , tariffs , incentives to corps , but the effects are not going to happen overnight - it takes at least a year or two before the direct effects properly materialize . previous presidents have found imperfect solutions because there are no great solutions . they find ways to make the world a little ( or a lot ) more stable and safe , but they do so by making certain trade-offs . trump does not like these imperfect solutions - and he 's not alone , because even supporters agree they have flaws . so when trump takes the imperfect answer off the table , there is no more solution and the world is less safe and less stable . again , this has n't been done because it is a complex area of the world and doing so was politically dangerous - we more deeply entrench israel 's enemies , while giving them a somewhat political ( but not practical ) victory . we already supported israel massively with financial/military support . their embassy being in israel has no practical advantage to them or to us . however , numerous geopolitical experts who were far more aware of what 's going on than you , as well as international investigators who were in charge of making sure iran stuck to the deal , all agreed that it was working to make the world more stable and safe . to wit : many view sinclair broadcasting and fox news to be far more corrupt and biased , which he not only does not "" put an eye on "" , he actively supports and endorses . if we 're going to give presidents credit for the jobs created during their administration , president obama created 15 million jobs in eight years . about $ 1 billion were put in place by obama to fight the opiate crisis . i 'm willing to bet you a month of gold that you ca n't find anywhere that obama stated daca was unconstitutional and illegal . finally , donald trump has had many senior cabinet level posts resign due to scandal , do you think that is a sign of good judgement even selecting staff ? if you view "" get [ ting your ] thoughts out there "" as an end goal , then it is definitely the wrong sub ."
9qlvh8,"steven avery is innocent and the american justice system is incredibly flawed after watching the 2nd season of making a murderer i 'm in total shock . i understand that it is an extremely biased view of the case , but the evidence that avery 's lawyer has found is incredible , even finding two new suspects . i also find the decision of the supreme court not to review the brendan dassey case to be disgusting and a clear sign that the american justice system is completely flawed in so many ways . i have no idea why the supreme court would not want to review the case . i believe the reason the avery case is finding so many walls blocking it 's path is because the county can not afford the potential lawsuit they 'd have to pay if avery was released , as well as them not wanting the world to know the enormous cover up . i 'm genuinely interested in a discussion here , if you think avery and dassey to be guilty , then explain how ? as i said i understand that it 's an extremely bias view of the case , but the evidence presented by the new lawyer can not be biased .","the supreme court can not review every case that comes before it , and ultimately their efforts as the highest court in the land are best focused on cases where there is significant legal precedent to be set or interpretation of important statutes rather than individual fact scenarios that may or may not be deserving of a different decision . further , if the evidence found by the lawyers was so compelling , why did it fail to convince the full court of the 7th circuit ? there is a tendency for the public to feel that scotus is the only court that matters , but that significantly devalues the expertise and effort of the multiple layers of circuit court that a case has to go through - the justice system is not broken just because not every case goes to scotus . that avery 's conviction failed to get overturned through multiple apellate courts suggests that in fact his lawyers arguments and evidence were not strong enough ."
9qlao4,"for the most part , conservatives have been on the wrong side of history times change , and so do societies . trying to cling to the past and leave things unchanged is against the nature of civilization in my opinion . sure , extreme liberalism is not good , but when it comes to things in society , conservative 's attempts to maintain the status quo have mostly only damaged society . i am not even talking about political parties . in general , conservatives have opposed ending slavery , giving women equal rights , among other things , just because that had been the way things were . conservatives usually end on the wrong side of history , and that will be the way people will look back at the current times","conservatives , however , also oppose detrimental social change , and they will be on the right side of history in those cases . however , since society does not change in those cases , it does not go in the history books , and there is no "" side of history "" to be on . conservatives , for example , were on the right side of history in opposing communism in america during the cold war , but there is no social change to look back on and take credit for . i do n't disagree that conservativism has opposed necessary change a times , but i think thinking it 's "" on the wrong side of history "" is revealing of skewed perception of our societies . history records change more than anything , which of course will end up portraying conservativism as either inexistent or wrong . however , to put it ridiculously simply , conservativism "" wins "" when things do n't change and things do n't change a whole lot . that 's important , i think , because stability is an important part of our social order . conservatives are currently in the right in pushing for due process , and progressives are currently in the wrong for trying to get rid of it . i purposefully did n't say convervatives are on the right side of history , because that phrase in and of itself endorses a specifically progressive narrative . "" the right side of history "" assumes that there is a "" right side "" of history , and that side is always towards the future . so saying "" i will end up being recorded in history books as being right "" may or may not be True , but regardless of whether it 's True , that does n't make you right . conservatives and progressives push and pull on society , tugging in opposite directions . progressives are always pushing for changes they see as good , and they push hardest for the changes they think are the best . conservatives are always pulling back from changes they see as bad , and they pull hardest against changes they think are the worst . as a result , the best changes generally happen , and the worst changes generally do n't . if progressives always won , society would disintegrate , as they see little value in social cohesion or boundaries . if conservatives always won , society would stagnate , as they see little value in changes . it 's easy to see which progressive movements were successful , because it was these movements that played a notable role in shaping our society today . at the same time , failed progressive movements are n't really visible at all because they failed . there have been a few notable progressive movements which have failed . finally , i 'd just like to point out that progressive movements can easily undo previous changes that were considered progressive when they were enacted . firstly , your contention stems from a fundamental misconception of the conservative ideology , asserting that it is based on the principle of stagnation . this is simply unTrue , conservatism does stem from an ideological need to conserve those social processes which has created the greatest amount of prosperity , as well as natural rights , however it accepts the central necessity of reform in order to conserve . in order to conserve , one must reform the current political , economic , or societal system in order to create a greater degree of prosperity . however one must also draw a sharp distinction between reform and innovation , reform builds upon previous knowledge , experience , institutions , and the social processes of the past , whilst innovation simply revolutionizes without regard for past social processes . secondly the notion of the “ wrong side of history ” is obscure , as objective morality does exist , one must also recognize that subjective morality is often written by the victors of a given struggle , in the sense of illusory morality . so the notion of the “ wrong side of history ” is an incredibly obfuscating notion . you must be incredibly specific in your definition of this term , so as to justify your central thesis without the risk of your entire argument falling into a void of illusion and obscurity . thirdly , the notion that opposing civil rights , women ’s rights and the like is the conservative position is absolutely ludicrous , no True conservative holds the belief that the institution of slavery , of suppression , and of legal inequality must be upheld . on the contrary , as conservatives believe in the conception of inalienable rights which are by the edicts of natural law and conferred upon all individuals by virtue of birth . it 's hinged that for the most part , conservatives have been on the wrong side of history but fails to provide an adequate trend or set of examples . saying "" opposed slavery "" is a single fair instance , saying "" oppose women 's equal rights "" is pretty vague and saying "" among other things "" is filler text . i do n't think i need an example to explain that humans who make decisions are not always right . it has an extreme of "" conservative attempts to maintain the status quo only damage society "" . if i can find a single instance of conservative ideals that did n't damage society would that be enough to change your mind ? by having opposition a new fad ca n't just come in and take over . this gives the impression that they are on the wrong side of history but more often than not it actually steers history in the right direction . abraham lincoln was conservative , and was the first president from the republican party . the republican party was literally founded for the purpose of ending slavery , created from the merger of the conservative whig party and other smaller conservative parties . the 19th amendment , which gave women the right to vote , was ratified by 36 states , 26 of which had replublican majority legislatures . of the 9 states that voted against it , 8 had democratic majority legislatures . wyoming , the first state in the nation to grant women the right to vote , has almost never had a democratic majority , at any point in it 's history . entire cold war and struggle of western nations against communism in the xx century and nazism decades prior to that was fighting against people that thought they were representing progress and the "" right side of history "" maybe a clearer way to think about this would be "" those who approach the world selfishly tend to be in the wrong side of history , while those who approach the world with compassion end up in the right . "" it may be True that the movement that calls itself conservative in the us has been on the wrong side of history , but it becomes a disputed matter of tracing historical origins before 1964 or so . and ultimately , the basic emotion behind treating others badly is self focus , while the emotion behind expanding human rights and improving the world is compassion . if you mean it in the colloquial sense , then your examples of “ conservatives ” being on the wrong side of history are not really applicable as even the term conservative was n’t made commonplace until william f. buckley popularized it in an effort to rebrand the republican party in the 1950s and 1960s . slavery is an even more unrelated issue to the schism between conservatives and liberals . if , on the other hand , by conservative you mean someone who is against advocating for change/progress , then i ’d wager that you would have to concede that not all change is positive . take for example soaring inflation rates after bad economic policy changes , would conservatives be in the wrong in your view in this case ?"
9qkspq,"some people 's hatred of other groups is more justified than others . a black person hating white people and a white person hating black people can both be viewed as racist . both are generalizing the others ' group based on race . however , the reasons and rationale behind that hatred can differ . if the black person 's hate and racism is derived from the history of whites oppressing blacks in the us , i would argue that is more understandable and also more acceptable than a white person 's hate and racism toward a black person based upon a notion of superiority . similarly , if a woman is sexist and hateful toward men , it might be more understandable than if a man is sexist and hateful toward women . is it really intellectually honest to criticize the sexist woman and the sexist man equally in the case i laid out above ? is it really justified to criticize equally the black person and the white person for being hateful and racist ? or is there more nuance to hate and racism and sexism and other generalizations ? i think there is ... while all hate and sexism and racism are bad , some forms of them deserve less criticism than others .","saying a black person hates white people due to oppression is a genuine reason , however what if a white person said they hated black people due to fear that they might be attacked ( based on violent crime rate statistics ) . each definition of hate is unjust as not all whites are responsible for slavery and not all blacks are violent . these are just stereotypes so therefore it ’s wrong to justify hate based hate just on the other race being white or being violent .

9qkn5w,"of all the men ( rightfully ) accused in the wake #metoo , louis c.k. deserves a second chance . let me say at the outset that what louis c.k. did was wrong and morally reprehensible for a variety of reasons . this post is in no way a defense of what he did ; it is , however , trying to put it into perspective of other forms of abuse . i understand this opinion is a unpopular one , but am truly looking for people to cmv in this post , and explain to me their viewpoints . i want an honest discussion about a very sensitive issue . i also want to say that i am a man , but my family has been affected by sexual abuse . two of my family members have been sexually assaulted , something that has been on my mind in the wake of #metoo . at the end of the day , while i believe louis c.k. should be punished in the court of public opinion , i do not believe that punishment should include a lifetime ban from entertainment the same way i feel it should for people like kevin spacey , bill cosby , and harvey weinstein , for the following reasons : 1 . degree of the accusations : i believe that "" bad things "" have degrees . unwanted exposure and lewd questions are horrible and deserve consequences ; but physically violating someone through physical contact is far worse . i do n't believe it is fair to equate louis exposing himself to someone physically violating another person 's own body , as was the case with cosby , spacey , and weinstein . i think that the physical violation of another person 's body is one of the most vile acts human beings can do to another person , but that is not what louis c.k. did . of the 3 instances reported in the nyt article , none of them involved physical contact . there is one anecdote about louis possibly “ shoving a women into a bathroom ” , but as of now we do n’t know if this actually happened nor the circumstances involved . no woman has come forward to directly accuse louis of this . 2 . a reasonable explanation : in his response to the ny times article , i am sympathetic to c.k. 's claims that he did not fully understand how much power he wielded over these individuals because of his celebrity . to his credit , in every one of these instances , c.k. did ask before committing these acts . these instances seemed to happen at the time when his career was first starting to really flourish . i take him for his word when he said he did n’t understand how , in his newly found celebrity , asking was n’t really “ asking . ” that is in no way an excuse for what c.k. did because his behavior was still wildly inappropriate , but i am still somewhat sympathetic to his explanation , which leads into my third point … 3 . lack of predatory nature : louis c.k. made bad judgments , but his behavior does not seem predatory to me the same way cosby 's , spacey 's , and weinstein ’s were . he never threatened to ruin a woman 's career for not allowing him to expose himself in front of them , and based on the information we currently have , it seems as if this behavior stopped at some point . now , it is alleged that c.k. ’s agent david becky may have made vague threats on louis ' behalf to the women who accused him , but i do n't think that is enough to put that blame on louis . it is possible becky was acting without c.k. ’s knowledge . 4 . shows of remorse : louis c.k. seemed to show remorse for his actions well before the #metoo movement . he contacted at least two of the accusers years before #metoo and apologized . furthermore , when the ny times article was published , i found louis c.k. 's response to be a no-bs acknowledgement of both the accusations and the hurt he caused . this was in stark contrast to so many other men accused in #metoo who flat out denied or dodged allegations . i think we have to give c.k. credit for that . 5 . a learning moment : undoubtedly , the importance of #metoo is that it finally gives victims of sexual assault a voice . but perhaps in time weo we should also hear from truly contrite men who have behaved inappropriately in the past to understand their reasoning and learn from their thoughts and regrets . i do n’t believe we should give predatory monsters like cosby , spacey , and weinstein a voice to explain their actions . but i do believe for some men , men who have crossed lines in the past but later grown to show remorse over it , it would actually be helpful for future generations to hear what they have to say rather than banning them from the public square for life , especially from someone with such a raw , self examinory talent like louis c.k. frankly , even though i believe he deserves a second chance , it may be too soon for us to hear from c.k . it may be too soon for c.k. to make a “ comeback ” , but i think some day he should be allowed to .","it all sounds like he regrets getting called on it , is ashamed and knows it was wrong , but would n't have admitted to it or made amends unless forced to . c.k. wants to come back and pretend nothing has happened , rather than making meaningful amends for the harm he did to his victims and the ongoing harm he is doing to their careers -- or even acknowledging that harm ! because he is going about his comeback effort in such a callow and self serving way , we know that he does n't deserve a second chance . louis c.k. deserves a second chance once he 's made peace with his victims , and those victims have given their blessing for louis c.k. to have a second chance . once the same happens in the louis c.k. saga , he 'll have deserved his second chance as well . when louis c.k. went on stage , unanounced , after a mere 9 month exile , he made a rape joke . why does louis c.k. deserve a second chance when many aspiring comedians who are innocent of sexual misconduct have n't even been given a first one ? op states that his actions were n't predatory and he learnt from them , and maybe so . a big part of the push back in c.k. 's case ( and a lot of others in #metoo ) is that he did n't do much if anything to actually show he was contrite . i think the strongest argument i 've heard is - why should he be allowed to make a come back , when all the women he turned off wo n't be ? you never hear people asking to bring the victim 's careers ' back . i think you are giving short shrift to two important points here : he then went on to use his status and power to discredit and destroy his coworkers reputations , only owning up to it once he could no longer credibibly deny what he did . that said , if you want to frame the question as whether ck "" deserves "" a second chance , i 'd have to say there should be some real consequences , demonstrated growth , and reparations made to his victims before we can even talk about what he deserves . what i would push back against is this idea that he has actually suffered or that he deserves anything from us ( including sympathy ) because he is talented unlike some other sexual predators ."
9qjmj8,"the united states is not particularly conservative compared to the rest of the world , and those who think so are prone to cherry-picking largely western european policies . the usa is neither conservative nor liberal compared to the rest of the world , for the foremost reason that neither words have consistent or encompassing definitions . also , observers that make this claim are overlooking a myriad of public policies from other countries that would be considered too ' conservative ' by american standards . lastly , those who make this claim have stuck to specific geographies , namely western europe , to support it . this is certainly not to say that the us is more liberal , that would be an equally bold claim . my belief is that to make a comparison between two countries on a contrived bilateral spectrum is erroneous .","for example , a common claim is that the countries with the best healthcare results overwhelmingly have socialized medicine . the mainstream american conservative view would be extremist in most of these countries , and american liberal proposals tend to be conservatives to average in comparison to the countries with the best healthcare results . the american conservative view on guns is "" guns good , any regulation is bad "" . for instance , the us is one of only three or so countries worldwide that do n't mandate paid maternity leave , which is an economically "" liberal "" ( using american lingo ) policy . likewise , the us is also the only country that is not part of the paris climate agreement because most conservatives do n't believe in anthropogenic climate change . moreover , the us is also part of the 25 % of countries across the world that still actively carry out death sentences , which many countries in eastern europe , south america , and africa no longer do . so , at a federal level with regards to certain policies carried out at a federal level , the us is much more conservative than countries even outside western europe . i think for the most part people are just referring to the fact that the american understanding of centrist economics is shifted to the right of some economic standards in europe and other places that do n't really get debated . things like national health systems and socialized education are pretty common across the globe in places that can afford them and the debate over whether or not to have them is kind of a non-partisan issue for the most part . in the us , you 're often considered a radical liberal for supporting these policies even if they 're considered centrist in other places . assuming that the “ conservative ” category is on the right end of the political spectrum , the us is indeed more politically conservative than most of the world . there are very few far right governments on the planet at this moment - even some of the theocratic governments are politically on the left ( even though they are socially more conservative ) . if , on the other hand , you mean socially conservative , you would have to look at the prevailing culture of every country to try to find some sort of ranking . since the us has a history of allowing people who suffer religious persecution to immigrate , we tend to be slightly to the conservative side of center on the social scale as well - and have been pretty close to the center of that scale for years . there are numerous countries that are more socially liberal , and many that are more socially conservative as well , so in the social context , your cmv is really difficult to quantify meaningfully . when people talk about "" the rest of the world "" what they are almost always referring to ( and usually explicitly say as much ) is the "" rest of the developed world "" or , more specifically , countries with which we are most culturally and economically similar which would be primarily western europe , the nordic countries , iceland , canada , australia , and new zealand . obviously compared to smaller developing nations , or much of southeast asia , our policies are different , but we are also culturally and economically significantly different than these nations so its really not a fair comparison . as such , calling it "" cherry picking "" is a bit strong - it 's not cherry-picking , it 's an intentional limitation of the scope of the discussion to those countries who we are most similar with on every except the policies in question . gun control , evolution , climate change , and socialized medicine are still massively controversial subjects in the us while in the entire rest of the modern world those are settled issues ."
9qis69,""" sex assigned at birth "" does n't make sense . it should be "" gender assigned at birth , "" if anything . i do n't understand that phrase , "" sex assigned at birth . "" if i understand the terminology correctly , a transgender person is a person whose gender does n't match his or her sex . so , a transgender person who is "" assigned male sex at birth "" is still the male sex after transitioning , just not male gender . so the phrase "" sex assigned at birth "" really is just a long way and unnecessary to say , "" sex , "" since this characteristic does n't change . i would understand , "" gender assigned at birth , "" but i understand that some people would n't like that , since a transgender man ( for example ) would likely state he was always a man by gender , even at birth . but saying "" sex assigned at birth "" makes it sound like a person was assigned one sex at birth , but that sex is no longer applicable . but that is n't True . so why do we say of a transgender man that he was assigned female sex at birth , rather than just say of a transgender man that he is of the female sex but of the male gender ? it does n't make sense . a couple notes . first , i understand that the phrase "" sex assigned at birth "" is n't only an issue when it comes to trans people , since there is a spectrum of genders , including , i believe , identifying as no gender at all . i used transgender as an example . second , i understand there are cases where a person does n't fit into a certain sex . for example , a woman by chromosomes might be born with a penis and identified as of the male sex at birth . in these cases "" sex assigned at birth "" makes sense , but the phrase is used outside those cases more often than not . i just think the phrase does n't make sense in the majority of cases where a person is biologically a specific sex and correctly identified as such . change my view .","socially speaking , people use the phrase because they do n't want to make presumptions about a person 's sex or gender . it 's just a way to give people the conceptual space that they need in order to tell you who they are , before you make assumptions that put them into a category they might not identify with . while sex may be “ static ” the very first time that it ’s established in any record of note is when a newborn is examined by a doctor . so if you want to communicate clearly to a lot of people you should not assume that they define those words the same way you have .

9qi7ju,"extremism is the logical conclusion of any social movement . the title basically sums up my view , but i 'd like to go into more detail . to start with , movements -- like veganism , feminism , religion , cancer research , the kkk , civil rights , and many more -- are organizations that supply two "" products "" to the public : outrage and change . organizations that do n't supply enough outrage , like the kkk , inevitably flounder , and organizations that do n't supply enough change , like kony 2012 , may have a burst of success but then vanish . then , at some point down the road of a movement 's lifetime , the actual goals of the movement change . while the stated goals of the movement have n't changed , the actual driving force of the movement has shifted : now the organization only seeks to preserve its own existence . and for a while , nothing changes , since there 's still activism to accomplish . but what happens when a movement "" wins "" ? when everything the movement stands for is achieved ? the organization is still pursuing its continued existence , but outrage in its field has dried up . so what is the organization to do ? it ca n't just dissolve , that 's directly against its raison d'etre . but its outrage reserves are dry . thus , it begins manufacturing outrage . this is how we get oppression olympics , this is how we get conservative christians who literally believed obama would take away their guns , this is how we get susan komen suing other cancer research firms : the movement ran out of real outrage and had to resort to manufacturing their own . no movement woke up and decided to become extremists ( well , some did , but not the majority ) . instead , these movements started casting their nets further afield for outrage and change , and all they reeled in was crazy . and since the crazy was producing more outrage and change than the more levelheaded members , they move up into more control of the movement , until the entire movement is run by crazy .","sure , sometimes they go back to their extremist roots , but usually due to some external political force making them do that , not out of internal evolution . \ - judaism : started as a violent tribal cult of human sacrifice and genocide , now chill dudes in yarmulkas who read a lot and avoid shellfish . \ - christianity : quite literally started as an apocalypse obsessed death cult that practised terrorism . \ - islam : started as an extremely violent conquering religion , now mellowed to the point most muslims are indistinguishable from infidels , save for their dietary requirements . i think it 's worth defining movement , and drawing a distinction between a movement and an organization . if there is lots of cancer research still happening and saving lives , and money being raised by many organizations that goes to victims , that 's still a good thing - and is it fair to use one organization 's ethically questionable decision to paint cancer research as a movement that has exhausted itself . similarly , there may be some angry vegans out there , but there are still plenty of people who are just eating vegan or vegetarian - and potentially serving larger goals , like reducing the net amount of animals killed , lowering carbon emissions - without being part of peta or whatever . i would say that if you loosely define what a movement is , you 'll always find extreme people that operate within it or people who take it to a farther extent than others . i 'd also argue that outrage and change are not the only two products of , say , religion . i think labeling susan komen as "" extremist "" is pretty silly , but even one were to accept that , how about the hundred other cancer foundations out there ? its function is primarily to defend their uncontroversially correct side of those issues in court cases . the founders explicitly designed the constitution to avoid rapid change in any direction ( laws take a long time to pass , supreme court justices serve for life , etc. ) . can you tell me more about why you think outrage and change are the only two products a "" movement "" can offer ? also , i 'm curious about how you would distinguish between "" movements "" and "" organizations . "" to me it seems like a "" movement "" -- which i think of as being a collection of people who are all working towards some kind of reform , and is usually a bottom-up kind of thing -- is distinct from an organization . movements can contain multiple organizations with different aims and different strategies . you get a bunch of rational people who start a rational movement . i want to specifically change your view that the organizations ca n't dissolve ."
9qh9qk,"the government should regulate not subsidize i think that regulation alone can solve a lot of the historical problems that have come with pure free market . an example is the meat industry . market competition made us increase our production until our morals were compromised and the animals found themselves in inhumane living conditions . regulation of free market is okay because it still allows us to all compete with each other under given rules that we all follow . subsidisation is immoral because it favors one particular company and infringes the ability of other companies to compete which decreases overall efficiency . to be clear i understand that subsidizing can be an effective tool for the government to get things done , but i think it 's up to people to get those things done and it 's not the government 's place to interfere . this is a moral argument but i am a consequentialist so this should be an easy delta for some of you . please change my mind :] update : reddit you never disappoint . my mind is changed . 1 ) taxes and subsidies are two parts of the same tool and ca n't exist without each other . 2 ) we need both of them in the name of self defense and side note : a whole industry should be subsidized , never a specific company .","some industries are worth subsidizing because they ca n't be profitably run in the way that most benefits society . more people using mass transit is good for society overall because it reduces pollution and traffic . the problem is , for all that to work it has to be cheap enough for people to use it often , which makes it unprofitable to run without subsidies . sometimes the government have other agenda than the free market , and sometimes subsidizing works better to achieve these goals . the government wants people to have a job , so they offer anyone who is willing to pay employees a minimum wage , to subsidize a part of his business . the mayor wants the streets clean , so he pays people to clean and manage that work . the cia wants to be able to have an iphone unlocked by apple , but to impose a court order on them they need apple 's hq to be located in the us , so they might offer apple an incentive to relocate ( do n't know if there is such an offer in place , but it does make sense . probably the government would not be able to offer enough anyway ) . there are myriad ways to get around this , but probably the easiest method is if the federal government 's raw purchasing power can achieve approximately the same policy goals that regulation would . subsidies are sometimes given to companies by the government , in trade , for the outcome of better conditions for society . if you privatized the water system , you 'd end up with some people paying about as much or even less than what they pay for tapwater now , but other people would end up paying ten or twenty times more . it 's not good for the overall health of an economy for tapwater to have drastically differing regional price variations , so that 's one example of government subsidies stabilizing society by subsidizing a commodity . i 'm generally with you on this , i agree that lots of regulations are necessary . so if you make a certain behavior more profitable they will probably do that . they 're not necessarily interested in following all the rules all the time , that 's just not how capitalism works . looking at the us , the number of new significant regulations and major rules per year is usually around a hundred , adding to the hundreds and hundreds of pages of already published rules . the number of rules ( and the expense of the bureaucracy that goes into publishing , reviewing , and enforcing them ) has led politicians to increasingly call for "" cutting the red tape "" : reviewing and getting rid of unnecessary regulations . trump went even further and introduced a "" 1 in , 2 out rule "" meaning the number of overall regulations should gradually decrease , but effectively , this has just been a freeze on new regulations . if you do n't want the government interfering with the free market , then you have to get rid of regulations . the government manipulates the market by making the participants of it behave a certain way or face the threat of state violence . a market that is guided by the hands of government is not free . the incentive to grow as much as you can to get to market before spoilage drives prices below the sustainability of the market . to better understand your view , would you point out a specific problem that the government is trying to solve with subsidies that you believe would be better solved with regulations ?"
9qer7q,"you 're wrong when you say you identify as x if you 've never lived in country x with mobility being easier than ever , lots of people find themselves growing up in multicultural families . a child born and raised in canada can have parents from italy and new zealand . that child will have a unique experience growing up in a blend of cultures from all of these places . according to my view , this child is canadian . saying this is n't meant to dismiss their experience of italian and new zealand culture through their family . each person 's cultural experience is unique – your family circumstances , your friends ' and even the town and neighbourhood you grew up in , matter . but if you 've never lived in poland , can you really call yourself polish ? note of clarification . my view does not concern the use of e.g. "" irish "" as a shorthand for "" irish american , "" which sounds like a word omission when it 's obvious to all americans involved . it concerns e.g. irish americans who tell people from ireland "" i 'm irish , too . "" there are people who 's family immigrated multiple generations ago who still identify from their country of origin , yet do n't speak the language well ( if at all ) . my view is that they are wrong to identify with the people of a country they 've never been in . i do n't like my view as i do n't like telling people what they can and ca n't be . if someone lived in country y all their life and say they identify as from country x , it might mean they do n't feel like they belong in y. i do n't want to kick them when they 're down . but i ca n't help but cringe inside .","saying i am italian , for example , implies i am italian-american meaning i am american , but i have italian ancestry and family culture . the american or canadian part doesnt really need to be stated because well presumable we are in the country and you know i am here , the statement isnt about birthplace or current location but about family heritage . because you can have citizenship , speak the language of , and embrace the culture of a country , but only visited , and that should be legitimate for identity . your basically saying dual citizens of two parents from different cultures should pick the one they live in and not both ? that does n't mean i do n't love this country or any of that , it 's just my way of paying homage to my lineage and embracing the difficulties , prejudices and stereotypes my ancestors bore to get us here . i also think it 's different for americans than for others since damn near every one of us comes from a family that 's only been here as long as some european families have been in their current homes . with that said , though , i do n't think someone needs to have the blood of the culture they embrace to truly be a part of it . though my ancestors were italian and that fueled my love of history , art & architecture , i have no quarrels with people of any decent doing the same thing . people should n't pick and choose on a whim , abandoning one set of cultural values for another every other week , but i 'm not one to believe that anyone without the proper ' percentage ' of culture is an outsider . the child grows up never having visited poland , but is entirely raised by people who lived their whole lives there , with no outside influences or exposure . are you from the united states or canada ? i ask this because i constantly see a large number of europeans particularly driven up the wall by americans and canadians saying "" im irish "" or "" im chinese "" . foreigners simply are misunderstanding the True intent and question that is "" where are you from "" when asked by american/candians , same goes for the answer "" i am from x "" . these questions matter in a way i 've found europeans have a difficult time understanding because they underestimate how deep the "" immigrant nation "" psyche pervades n. american new world citizens . so growing up in the us/canada , everyone knows their ancestors came from somewhere else and this is combined that we all physically look a little bit different from each other even amongst "" white "" people . if you live in poland , chances are the vast majority of your neighbors have "" slavic "" facial features . the point is when you combine this pride of the original "" immigrant ancestors "" , with no one being "" from "" here , with general human curiosity about facial features , you get people asking where are you "" from "" ( ethnically and historically ) . st paticks day is kind of worse , cause it turns out everybody is irish . ( which includes myself even with my "" italian "" family ) in north america , i think you got ta be a bit flexible , because people here are from everywhere . just clarify with a "" german citizen "" or "" was born in latvia "" or something if you want to be clear with people . people are n't saying they identify as an irish citizen . you do n't have to have lived in ireland to be ethnically irish . your thought process is very black and white , and i would like to give you a different perspective to change your view . as you said , many people are now a mixture of ethnicities and cultures and nationalities . when people say "" i 'm chinese "" but they have never lived in china , it 's more likely they have answered that way because they have anticipated the follow up questions before they are asked . they have tried to overcome and avoid awkwardness and anxiety around the questions that might come after "" i 'm british "" , or , to avoid being told things like "" you do n't look chinese "" or "" you looked mixed "" or "" were you born here ? "" we learn behaviour from experiences and in this situation society has taught that when your ethnicity looks different to the country that you are in , people really want to know what your ethnicity is , rather than your culture or your nationality . from what i understand the answer you would like people to give you is "" i live in x , therefore i am x "" but unfortunately when a persons physical features do n't match the physical features of people native to country x , the answer "" i am x "" does n't seem to be enough for today 's society , but the answer ' i live in x , i am ethically y and my culture is z ' seems to satisfy society more . tldr : when asking about someones idenity , ethnicity , nationality and culture can not be assumed to be the same therefore someone can not be identified by one factor of x and is more often a combination of x , y and z. i do n't think this is an issue that you can simply make one decision about that applies to everyone . however , she also still has lots of family in india , she studies bengali , she goes to visit india periodically . i have several more friends from the middle east . they came here as teens , they speak arabic , they have dual citizenship , they 're from families that have lived in the middle east forever ... but at least for one of them , i do n't think they 're ever planning on going back . would my friend be wrong to consider herself american \ and \ lebanese , considering that she 's a citizen and a permanent resident of america , but she is both ethnically \ and \ legally lebanese ? maybe what bothers you is that people like to identify cultural heritage first as if to undermine / devalue the culture they experience living in another country ? or perhaps it 's because a person who 's canadian ethnically is n't canadian if he does n't experience the same geographic political concerns ? i also know some people like to make a big deal out of certain touristy locations , e.g. "" how can you call yourself x if you have n't visited y ? "" the living in that country distinction is a little confusing . someone born in ethiopia that was raised in jamaica , who now lives in new jersey . with claiming whatever you want being easier than ever , lots of people find themselves growing up questioning their gender . that child will have a unique experience growing up with a blend of genders from both ends of the spectrum . according to my view , this child is a boy . saying this is n't meant to dismiss their experience of men and women through their family . each person 's gender is unique - your family circumstances , your friends ' and even the town and neighbourhood you grew up in , matter . my dad 's family has been on a farm in pennsylvania for 200 years , so that 's easy for him . my mom 's family has been in colorado at least a century . they got married when my dad went into the air force , thus i grew up a little of everywhere and a lot of nowhere . i tend to identify with hawaii being my home , as that 's where most of my memories , friends , first job , first car , first phone etc. . so here 's the real cmv for you : people are whatever they choose to identify as . so in your example of the kid raised in canada . if they loved canadian culture , absorbed it , adopted it , and chose to identify as that , then yes , they would be canadian . but if they felt strongly connected to their italian heritage , putting time and effort into connecting to it ( learning the language , staying in touch with relatives still in the country , making homemade pasta idk ) then to me , that 's what they are . otherwise , we run the risk of stereotyping and discriminating people , which would be a fallacy on our part ( ie . a bit confused , are you basically saying that people should work more on assimilating to america vs. focusing their heritage on a country they chose to leave ? being ' american ' used to be a very large focus of immigrants . over the past 30-40 years , there has been a sharp turn for certain cultures to retain their identities of their native country , while being american citizens ... which causes additional cultural tension . that being said , most second generation folks take on the american identity . that being said , this does n't always happen and is less common with very religious folks ( practicing muslims , for instance ) , tend to retain their religious and cultural identity , much more than other immigrants . for example , there are millions of palestinians living in jordan and lebanon , who are the children , grand-children , and now great-grand-children , of those who fled in 1948 . those palestinians have never set foot in their ancestral homeland , but they definitely identify as palestinian . in the 1980s and 1990s , millions of afghans fled into pakistan , and thousands of children were born in the camps . americans who find out they have an irish ancestor so start identifying as irish even though they know nothing of the place are n't really irish . but i have somali friends & theyvidentify as somalian even though they 've never been because before they were born their parents left as refugees when the war broke out . but they 're part of the somali expat community , they fluently speak the language at home , celebrate somali style traditions , have traditional weddings with the traditional outfits . they 're still part of the culture even though they 've never been ."
9qdnuz,"i do n't identify as cis . first of all , this post is going to grant the premise that biological sex is separate from gender identity , and that individuals have the right to choose what gender identity they have and how they identify . i know there are many people who would n't agree with that premise , but i would not like to debate that here . that view of mine is not open to be changed . okay , onto the actual cmv . i am male . i was born male , was raised as a male , am a biotypical male , identify as male , present as male , want to be male , and my gender has always matched my sex . i am , by definition , a cisgender male . but i do n't identify with the term "" cis "" or "" cisgender "" . that word was never a part of my gender identity growing up , and it feels like something thrust upon me recently . i do n't think that society should force categories or labels onto people of any identity . the same way we should n't insist that certain people identify as transgender , i do n't think we should insist that certain people identify as cisgender . in the same way someone who has undergone an mtf transition may prefer to be called a woman without the trans qualification , i would prefer to be called a man without the cis qualification ... even though the qualifier is technically accurate for both of us . this gets back to how the sex we were born with is irrelevant to our current identity . when talking about our age , we do n't say that i am a 30 year old transtemporal baby . yes , i did technically transition from being a baby to being 30 years old , but that does n't matter to who i currently am that it needs to be specified . to put my view in perspective , i am not offended by the term , i do n't want to eliminate it , i am fine with other people choosing to use it to describe themselves . if i were in a room full of people and someone asked all the cis people to raise their hands , i would raise mine , knowing their intention . it is n't tied to any trauma in my life , and it 's not triggering . i just ... do n't feel like it 's "" my "" term . i do n't identify with it .","so overall , the issue boils down to it not being something you need to openly identify yourself with , but it is an accurate descriptor of your gender . you already say that you are cisgender , you just do n’t prefer to be identified as such . we ca n’t convince you that you want to identify as cis when you already know that ’s what you are . they are often confused with identities . these terms are adjectives which describe an aspect of someone 's life . transgender people identify as a gender other than the sex they were assigned as birth . similarly , cisgender people do not "" identify as cisgender "" , they identify as a gender that matches the sex that they were assigned at birth . cis and trans identify a state of affairs , they are n’t an identity . you do n’t have to identify with a term for it to properly describe you . you identify as male and no-one is trying to get you to call yourself anything other than male .... if yes , you identify as cis , you just use more words . do you feel like the cis term is something that people expect you to identify as regardless of the context ? just because you do n't identify with it , does n't mean you 're not cisgendered . it 's just a descriptive term in the end that means "" not trans "" . if you do n't feel like you belong in a gender not of your birth , then by default you 're not trans and thus cis . how you identify with that or not is n't of any great influence on the biological definition : if your blood sugar is > 7.0 fasting on two separate occasions , then you 're diabetic . what trans people identify with is being a gender that is n't their birth gender , and that situation is called being transgender . they do n't have to identify with being trans , they just are by default because that is what that means . i 'm confused as to how it 's thrust upon you as a part of your identity in your view ? i do n't identify as androgynous although that 's my gender identity . i 'm a biological woman but i have a masculine demeanor and have always felt more comfortable in men 's clothes than women 's and hanging out with groups of guys than i have with groups of women ( especially really feminine women ) . what makes me different than a transgendered person is i am happy and comfortable in a woman 's body . my point is that whatever a person 's gender identity is , whether it 's a word they chose themselves or society uses for them , it is n't their entire identity it 's just a label that 's used to help identify and categorize people . going off of your points it sounds like you 're saying since society calls me cisgender and i technicallly am then that 's my identity . also if you do some research on the word cisgender , you will learn that it was coined in the mid or early 90s . on one hand , you already accept the fact that this term is good to describe you , but you do n't identify to it . if you are "" obese "" , maybe you would not like to identify with the term , same for "" rich "" , or plenty of other ones . trans and cis are words of latin origin and they mean "" on the other side of "" and "" on this side of "" , respectively . transgender means something like being on the other side of the gender you were assigned at birth , cis gender means you are still on the same side . is this the same as a white person saying “ i do n’t identify as white , i never even think about what race i am ? ” identity is forged by social negotiation . you and those around you come to an agreement about what your identity is , be it gender identity or any other identity . society tends to deem people “ cisgendered ” when their biological sex aligns with their gender persona . it sounds like your gender persona aligns with your biological sex ."
9qdicu,"the left-wing in developing countries is kinda useless . - neoliberalism is the most appropriate economic system for developing countries . this kind of countries usually does n't have the budget to sustain too many state companies , so at least some of these services should be done by private companies . privatizations done well are good , do n't deposit too much faith on left-wing propaganda . also , developing countries have a lot of corruption in their politics , so the head of government will use the state companies for political favors instead of putting someone competent . - reforming the social security is necessary . i live in a country that has a smaller hdi than mexico but has an aging population . the left-wing opposes it because it "" "" "" "" "" will affect the poor "" "" "" "" "" ( to be fair , it 's hard to save money for retirement if you 're struggling to feed your household , but still ) . i do n't want to have more than two children , and the planet already has environmental issues with an apparently "" low "" population of seven and a half billion . why is it wrong to raise the minimal retirement age ? we live in a society where one is expected to make money , we ca n't afford to retire early to enjoy life . - communism and socialism : why do developing countries have communist parties ?! marx himself said that the country should be previously industrialized by capitalism in order to undergo the communist process . - immigration : yes , it may be kinda necessary if your country has population issues to sustain an elder population who did n't save money for their own retirement . but too many immigrants can be a problem to the country 's systems and raise xenophobia . why is it wrong to restrict the access to the country ? regarding refugees , the countries can hold some of them , but they also must help to solve the problem in the source country . - fight against discrimination : only middle-class kids with college degrees ( or currently studying in a college ) care about it . the average person in a developing country is too poor/busy/uneducated / conservative/has too many problems to care about it .","saying "" we live in a society where we are expected to make money , we ca n't afford to retire early "" is why it 's wrong to raise the minimum retirement age . that 's basically admitting that you know that deregulated free-market capitalism forces people to work on low incomes to barely survive and that society is getting worse for those workers ( by having to work longer before retirement ) . also , you 're sort of mixing in your individual situation , but the your op is generic ; "" we have an aging population and managed the budget badly "" is not something that is necessarily True of all developing countries . marx 's grand narrative was about how capitalism will inevitably fall to communism , but he was n't saying that countries should be industrialized by capitalism first . first , you admit that immigration is a net good for one of the other issues you bring up : an aging population . third , again , statements like "" it 's wrong to restrict access to the country "" are pretty far-left , and there 's a ton of the left-wing who would merely say that immigration should be expanded and that demonizing immigrants is a bad thing , not that there should be open borders or whatever . that kind of defeatism just seems like a reason to support groups you know are discriminatory because you like the other things they support . rather than try to debate you on specifics , i can think of a few examples where left wing policies are more favorable for developing countries . education : good public education produces good , productive workers , even low skilled employees are more productive if they are literate and have good reasoning and problem solving skills . it also taps the potential of working class people that do n't have access to private education . this is a long term investment that the government is capable of making that private companies ca n't . it 's worth the investment to make sure that people are taken care of and stay healthy . ensuring that children are well nourished will help create productive , functioning members of society in the future . also along these lines , govt assistance can bridge the gap between local producers ( like farmers ) and consumers . govt subsidies : ( this is more centrist than left wing ) in the country where i live , the govt provides housing subsidies for first-time home buyers so long as their under fixed prices ( say , if a home costs less than 40k , owners are eligible for a 8k subsidy , if a home costs less than 20k , owners are eligible for a 15k subsidy ) . secondly , it incentivizes developers to build housing to service the lower income/working class and middle class segment . and finally , it ensures a supply of quality housing for lower income people over the long term . no environmental protection means that private companies can cut corners to harm the environment , privatize the profit and socialize the cost . left parties try to limit the amount of power a single person can hold so they ca n't abuse their power as much , as well as institutions that have rhe ability to judge even the most powerful . education : some developing world leaders try to keep the population uneducated in purpose so they can feed whatever peopaganda to them . essentially the left in developing countries want their country to be a developed one with an educated population ' high gdp and high life standards . and they know this ca n't happen if the leadership and the institutions are corrupt and power is accumulated in the corrupt top end ."

9qdbzf,"world war 3 will happen within 50 years . i strongly believe that our ultimate purpose in life is to maximize humanity 's chance of survival in the long term . this view i do n't consider changeable . this has a few political implications , like caring a lot about education , infrastructure and space travel , but not as much about money or taxes ( unless used for those specific things ) . but the most important thing of all right now is climate change . i believe that climate change will be the trigger for world war 3 . ( i do not believe that world war 3 is the end of humanity , but it will reduce our population significantly and it will significantly slow down our progress as a civilization . basically , it 's bad . ) for context : i live in sweden , one of the most climate aware countries in the world . what we do is still not enough . 1 ) [ general population ] people are unwilling to change . this is apparent everywhere , most palpably in the us with all the media drivel about trump . even if people realize that there is a problem they "" need to survive "" themselves first . often that involves driving a car to work every day . eating meat . voting for politicias that "" help them "" instead of looking at the larger picture . that is not going to change until climate change becomes very apparent . it has been apparent in california for a while and change is happening fast there . but in a lot of other places people just wo n't care until it 's too late . 2 ) [ popular movements ] climate change denial is strongly linked to right-wing nationalism and right wing parties are growing fast in europe . as our population starts caring more about ( not getting as many ) immigrants , they stop thinking about climate change . 3 ) [ politics and big corps ] most of politics revolve around moving money around . fighting climate change is expensive , so many big companies lobby against it ( unless they do it for pr reasons , in which case they still do minimal effort ) . in the us it is very apparent how much politicians gets influenced by these big corp lobbyists , and i 'm sure it happens everywhere else too ( just not as direct ) . recently , the un ( ipcc ) released a very comprehensive report on climage change ( direct link to report ) which details the difference between 1.5 and 2 degrees c global warming . to reach 1.5 degrees , unprecedented changes has to be made . those changes are not being made today , and will very likely not be made because of points 1-3 ) above . the syria conflict was the result of tensions from a 4 year long lasting drought - a direct effect from climate change . it resulted in about 5 million refugees , of which countries in europe took in about 100k . under this pressure , many countries in europe buckled , and paved way for right wing nationalism , furthering point 2 ) above . as climate change progresses , this will happen again , and more frequently . sea level rise will become a big issue . bangladesh , a country with 166 million inhabitants will lose 40 % of it 's productive land if the sea level rises by 65 cm by 2080 - a level that is well within the estimations from ( ipcc report ) ( 0.26 to 0.77 m by 2100 for 1.5 °c global warming , or 0.3 to 0.93 m for 2.0 °c ) . the end result of this is mass emigration . even if we stop global warming at 1.5 degrees , mass emigration will still happen . --- it seems inevitable . as climate change progresses , two things will happen . first , droughts and floods will both be increasingly more common . before 50 years from now , the world 's population have increased by about 3 billion from today and i strongly believe that the world will be unable to feed a population that large ( citation needed ) . because of this , several tens or even hundreds of millions of people will become homeless or be forced to move because of food shortages , and in some places ( like in syria ) it will trigger civil wars , increasing the number of refugees even further . this will be a major world crisis . secondly , countries will start to blame each other for not doing enough , while simultaneously closing their borders to protect themselves from the endless stream of refugees . right wing nationalism will flourish . the tension will soon be unbearable . when the refugee count reaches several 100s of millions or even billions , there are only two solutions . 1 ) let them starve and die slowly . 2 ) kill them quickly . which of these is the most humane will not be agreed on . when the first country resorts to 2 ) , world war 3 has begun . i believe this will happen within 50 years . please , change my view . --- this has been a major source of depression for me lately , so i really want this view changed . i do n't have good sources for all of my claims - my conclusions comes mostly from educated assumptions and logical reasoning . so citing sources that contradict those assumptions is a good way to change my view .","if nations people want to flee to start murdering refugees at their border how is that the beginning of a 3 . even if the nations would start invading the countries people flee from to murder them there ( which is very , very far fetched , as there is no incentive to do so . if you go full nazi on refugees you can just deal with them when they arrive at your doorstep , much more efficiently ) , who would strike back in full force to start the war ? the nations people flee from will hardly be able to start a campaign if they are falling apart . a massive refugee crisis seems likely and will definitely be a huge problem but i do not see it as a spark for world war 3 . what could be a potential spark is war for dwindling rescources , but even then : the very real threat of a nuclear holocaust in case of a full blown world war makes it that much more unlikely . i 'm not sure there will be a world war 3 . if it ever happens that the world knows a world war , i think it would then lead to either the extermination of everyone or a one sided extermination war ( if the country hits first ) . not to mention ai that can be turned to a world massive genocide weapon if it has n't already been done which would surprise me quite frankly . if we get a world war , it will be the first country or groupe of countries to strike that will most likely win , and if it does happen , the whole world other than that country will be wiped out . we could even argue that the world would get so miserable that it would even make the winning country in a hard spot ( huge disaster of the fauna and flora , probably toxic air , uncultivable lands . so i really do n't think there will be a world war 3 because everyone is aware of the unprecedented disaster it would cause to everyone . this is known as the "" balance of terror "" or "" balance of power "" or "" mutual assured destruction "" . if pressed , we can address effects of climate change with geo engineering , at least in short-medium term . world war 1 happened because people did n't know the destructive capacity of modern weapons . they thought the war would be over in months but that was n't the case . now people know a new world war would be absolutely terrible for everyone involved . which means the powerful political players of the world would n't want a new global war , simply because it would hurt them as well . i do n't know if this will help your depression - but i do n't think your points actually develop towards world war 3 . instead it seems more like a collapse of society with each country fighting itself inwards . i do n't think anyone will actually turn to 2 . so , if that 's your trigger event , i do n't think it 's plausible ."
9qcrw3,"transgendering is not necessary . i have just heard the news ( from a non-us media ) that the trump administration is considering the definition of gender as the sex of birth . in my opinion , there is little you could gain by changing the sex , in this modern world . so , i think being classified as the gender you do not like is not a practical problem . i am a male , but i am not that masculine . i am weak and i like some of the things that traditionally females do . and frankly no one is stopping me from doing so or at least advise me not to do those things . who would stop me if i knit sweaters ? i think this is the same for females . what prevents them from becoming a construction worker , if they are physically strong ? if they are not strong , then they can not , but that rule would also apply to physically weak men , regardless of the sex . i can hardly think of any jobs that you are not allowed to get , just because of the sex . there are few things that only people of certain sex can do , like giving birth to a child , but you do not get the ability by transgendring , do you ? also , i do not believe in modern medical technology . i mean , we still do not well about our body . that is why i try to avoid any operation on my body , if it is not absolutely necessary , especially if it is irreversible , such as pulling wisdom teeth . you can not really be like a biological male/female by transgendring . as far as i have heard , that sort of technology does not exist . i have heard a lot about the side effects of cosmetic surgeries . so , maybe transgenering operation is like that too . another thing for which gender matters is finding a sexual partner . for example , if you are a man but the person you like is a traditional man who are sexually attracted only to women , you can not have him because of your sex . but , i think you can hardly change that situation by transgendering . i mean , if that traditional man had rejected you because you are a man , chances are that he would probably reject you again if you become a transgender woman . and if you just want to have a partner or marry someone of the same physical sex , there already are plenty of homosexual people who would accept you as you are , without transgendering . and in many places , you two can legally marry , too . another thing is maybe clothing and putting on makeups . people would look at you if you are a man with beard but walk in a park wearing a woman 's dress . but is clothing really that an important thing to take an operation which may decrease your health ? i mean , regardless of the sex , there are certain clothes that you can not wear in public places , even if you want . for example , i like pajamas , because they are comfortable . but i can not wear it to go to work . we already have these kind of limitations , but it is not a big of a deal . plus , if you do really wish to , you can ignore what others think and walk in a park in a woman 's dress as a man . people will look at you , but actually , no one would try to prevent you from doing so . so , you can practically do all such things with little or no actual penalties , if you do not mind what others think . if some magician put a spell on me , so that somehow everyone else sees me as a biological woman ( even though i am physically a male ) and and i am classified as a female by law , i do not think there would be any meaningful changes to my life . ( sure , there could be some minor things like not being able to use men 's public bathroom and urinals there , but no one takes transgendering operation for that , do they ? ) i still would be able to do what i want to do , live by the way i like . i do not mind wearing gender-neutral cloths at all . it is not that people force women to wear dresses or anything . if there is a man who thinks he is a woman in the brain but he is classified as a male by the sex of birth , is that a practical problem ? i do not think so . but what do i know . if you disagree and transgendering is necessary for such people , please counterargue my points .","you also now need to constantly hear people refer to you as a woman . when they ’re trying to describe you in a crowd , they say “ see that woman in blue ? ” first , i think you mean transitioning , not transgendering , people are just transgender it is not something that can be an action . there is statistical grouping for all the sexual traits of both sides , but it is possible and not that uncommon to have outliers , such as people with xxy chromosomes , or cis women with xy chromosomes , or people with physical anomolies like being born with both genitalia or no genitalia . trans people fall inti this category , because instead of an exterior physical anomoly , it is one of the brain , more subtle and hard to detect for sure , but visible when studying larger groups . i am a transgender woman , and frankly im not all that feminine . most of what i wear is jeans and tshirts , i wear minimal makeup , just enough to cover irritation from shaving ( which i wont have to do soon ) , and to make my eyelashes not invisible . my hobbies are not traditionally masculine or feminine , i like clamming , playing piano and guitar , listening to music , and finding places to perch and sit ang observe the world . i also work as a private investigator , which is a traditionally male dominated field . both trans women and trans men people have a range of gender expression , just like cis people . it does and will always bother me that i cant have children as a biological mother , i think its safe to assume that many sterile cis women feel the same . i am personally bisexual , am married happily to a woman , and dont really like having actual sex or relationships with men because of trauma in my past . i did not transition because of my sexuality , frankly i wouldve been better off without transitioning if that was my goal , i was a reasonably attractive guy . i go to work casually most of the time , but i have dress pants and nicer shirts for claimant interviews , and a womens suit and a couple nicer dresses for when i have to testify in court or have another formal social occasion . i "" pass "" quite well , and no one i interact with on a daily basis sees me as a man , or even realizes that im trans , i just exist as a normal woman . at this point i would look like i was cross dressing in the other direction if i wore mens clothing . for one , the primary purpose is as a treatment for gender dysphoria , which really sucks to deal with and transitioning is very effective at treating and alleviating . legal recognition is practical for both the individual and for the state . for one , medically as a trans women , i am susceptible to the general risks of being female , i have to watch out for breast cancer , dvt , embolisms , osteoperosis , etc more than men do , and heart disease isnt that big of a problem . if i go to the hospital for chest pain in my 30s it is important for them to have that gender marker if im unconscious and to check for pulmonary embolisms with more priority . for me personally , every time i showed my id during the time before i got it legally changed i was opening myself up to discrimination or potentially assault , from business owners , state workers , business clients , even the police . i had difficulty buying liqour and getting into bars because i didnt look like my id photo and im clearly a woman using a mans id . i have to check in with the police every morning i do surveillance for work , and there was a long time where i had to use facebook and photos from my facial surgery to prove that i was the person on my id . from the states point of view , one of the main reasons there is a gender marker on id is so law enforcement can identify people . if the police are looking for a 5 foot 10 man with blonde short hair and a beard , they probably arent going to take notice of me as a 5 foot 8 woman with long brown hair . the major worry with this new action from the trump administration is that it will create conflict between state and federal documents for us who have already made legal changes , which would prevent us from getting passports , new employment , insurance , and many other things were federal and state information needs to match , and is clearly an effort by the federal government to strong arm the states into repealing their own laws about the legal changes . for people who need to gender transition they genuinely need to , and it 's often a matter of life and death . you are speaking in stereotypes instead of deeply seated and probably neurologically justified matters of identity . this is like if you said "" there is no need to be a lesbian , even if you are straight you can still act like a tomboy , have short hair , and wear a bunch of leather . "" people are , to the best of our knowledge , born transgender . no one decides on a lark to have sex reassignment surgery just so they get to act out different gender stereotypes . furthermore , such a redefinition would change how trans people are housed in homeless shelters and jails and prisons , which would expose them to increased dangers . this not to mention trans children being unable to use locker rooms and bathrooms of their choice , which will lead to the sort of bullying that puts trans kids at such high risk of suicide . studies show that if trans people can identify with their preferred gender and they are socially accepted in that choice , they are at no higher risk of depression and suicide than the rest of the population . if the government is saying legally we do n’t accept who you are , that trickles down , and we ’re going to have a lot more hate crimes , suicides and human misery on our hands . so , your view is filled with stereotypes that have little accuracy to real transgender people . i am transgender and i interact with a lot of trans people , and neither i nor any of the trans people i know transitioned for those reasons . the reason every single trans person i know transitioned ( i ’m sure there are exceptions to this , but they ’re not common ) is because of discomfort felt with their body . another major misconception you have is that all transgender people are having surgeries , but in reality , most transgender people have none . instead , the more common practice is to take hormone therapy , which basically causes the body to go through the other gender ’s puberty . i am now able to make decisions to better my life , whereas before , i could n’t care about what happened in my life . similar posts can be found through our [ deltalog search ] ( -- url -- + | + gender + | + transphobia + | + trans & restrict"
9q9mlc,"the israel/palestine conflict can no longer be solved peacefully . i ’ve been getting really into this sub , and i ’ve finally thought of a view i hold strongly that i would actually dearly love to have changed . i know there was a related post earlier today , but it seems to have mostly devolved into finger-pointing . ground rules : ( i ) i do n’t care who ’s right and who ’s wrong , either historically or currently , ( ii ) i do n’t care about what should happen based on what the people involved deserve : any suggested solution has to be politically feasible , taking into account how the united nations actually works , internal israeli politics , internal palestinian politics , current israeli-palestinian relations , and the political realities in the middle east , the united states , and the world , and ( iii ) any solution can not involve a serious breach of international law , because that ’s essentially what i ’m predicting will occur . it seems to me , looking at a map of the extensive israeli settlements within the west bank , and especially the areas around the settlements in which palestinians are not allowed to develop ( link below ) that there is no longer any chance of a long-term peaceful solution between israelis and palestinians . there ’s no longer enough contiguous palestinian land to form a functioning palestinian state . [ -- url -- ) in order to create a functioning palestinian state , israel would have to forcibly evacuate all of its citizens from the west bank like it did in the gaza strip . however , there were n’t nearly as many settlers in the gaza strip as there are in the west bank , there ’s no political will in israel to do such an unpopular thing , and no international political will to force them to do it , nor is any likely to develop . so if there ’s no two-state solution , then what can be done about the palestinians ? there ’s no chance israel will make them citizens , because they would outnumber the jewish israelis . the only outcomes i can reasonably foresee are a south africa-style apartheid in which the palestinians become a permanent underclass in israel without the same rights as israelis , or a point where the israelis begin to forcibly evict palestinians into the surrounding arab countries .","this post is based on a False dichotomy that either israel remove all of its settlements or face the realities of apartheid . for example , settlements could be part of a palestinian state and the jews within them could become jewish palestinians , just as there are arab israelis , or voluntarily go back to israel with a hefty resettlement package . also , even if israel were to annex the entire west bank and give the palestinians there citizenship , jews would still maintain a small but stable majority . i 'm personally for a two-state solution and i agree that the israeli right is actively making it more difficult to achieve this , but there are other outcomes that would allow israel to exist as a jewish-majority democracy . there 's another possible outome to the conflict : paid transfer , this was offered by the israeli right , the plan is to offer palestinian families a huge amount of dollars in return that they would leave another point to your side : the palestinians never accepted a single peace deal made by israel , from 1947 to 2008 south africa did n't end apartheid until it received significant external pressure . the usa vetoed resolutions against israel 43 times by 2017 ."
9q9ks7,"income disparity in america is a big problem and needs to be fixed income disparity in america the united states particularly suffers from the problem of how income for individuals are distributed . the top 1 % richest people in the united states are richer than the bottom 90 % of the population \ [ dollars and sense \ ] . think of it this way , if someone makes 500 times as much money as someone else . they must have worked hard for that money , but did they work 500 times as hard for it ? probably not . the is the reason the wealth gap exists for those reasons . people can work more can earn less than people who work more but earn less and merely claim their contribution to the economy is more important than stopping people from starving on the streets . in the united states , the middle class made up 26 % of incomes , down from 46 % in 1979 \ [ market watch \ ] . the upper middle class made up 63 % of incomes in the united states , up from 30 % in 1979 \ [ market watch \ ] . this just goes to show that income disparity has worsened in the united states , so much so that one could say that there is no such thing as a middle class , rather an upper and lower middle class due to income disparity separating people that are even in the same class . before diving into the solution in mind , one must first know what income defines a person ’s class . the average annual income made by the richest 10 % is $ 133,445 , the average annual income made by the richest 1 % is a whopping $ 1,740,096 dollars per year \ [ dollars and sense \ ] . with such few people earning so much money , it creates problems like a severe widening of the income gap between the rich and the poor . that problem needs to be fixed , but how one may ask ? the answer to that question ending the previous paragraph is predistribution . predistribution is the idea that the state should try to prevent inequalities in income and wealth in the first place rather than raising the tax the rich have to pay and vice versa for the poor \ [ wikipedia \ ] . the poor would have an increased income and the rich would have a decreased income . the rich do not need more money as they are already rich , the poor , however , do need more money , one would be arrogant for thinking otherwise . predistribution should n’t be underestimated as its influence can be seen in canadian and british politics ; the themes of predistribution in the united kingdom as getting the macro-economy right , providing quality public services and to discover new ways to control the market-economy \ [ wikipedia \ ] . this guarantees everyone has the skill set and the possibility to accumulate wealth , like someone whose rich . lord wood of anfield argues predistribution is necessary against “ the face of rising inequality , declining social mobility and stagnating real wages for middle-income earners , there are limits to what redistribution can achieve on its own "" \ [ wikipedia \ ] . another commonly proposed solution to the income disparity problem is income redistribution . income redistribution is defined as the transfer and wealth of income and of wealth from some individuals to others by taxation , charity , welfare , etc . however , the united states already have an implemented system of heavier taxation for people who have a higher income . someone who makes 0 to 9,325 dollars a year must give 10 % of it for income tax , someone who makes 37,951 to 91,900 dollars a year must give 25 % of it for income tax , someone who makes 416,701 to 418,400 dollars a year have to give 35 % of it for income tax \ [ bankrate \ ] . however , income disparity has actually worsened in the past 30 years and income tax being adjusted for various income ‘ classes ’ has n’t made a dent in solving the problem . besides , predistribution would stop income inequality in the first place and therefore solves the income disparity problem entirely while income redistribution only helps solves the problem a bit after the income has been distributed . yet another commonly proposed solution is to have a maximum wage limit . a maximum wage limit is a proposed legal limit on how much income an individual can earn \ [ wikipedia \ ] . this in my opinion is better than income redistribution , but not as good as predistribution by itself . i feel the maximum wage limit would be useful in incorporating it into predistribution . like how a minimum wage limits the deflation of money , a maximum wage limits the inflation of money \ [ wikipedia \ ] . however , some critics of this idea argue a maximum wage on the upper class will just restructure compensations and benefits . they also claim a maximum wage limit only nominally stops the rich from getting richer \ [ wikipedia \ ] . what deems these criticisms void is predistribution itself . predistribution ensures whatever loophole there may be in the maximum wage limit will soon be stopped by the state itself . the idea of a maximum wage limit is currently being petitioned by the people of america . those people propose a limit of an annual wage of 1 million dollars , which in my opinion is reasonable \ [ moveon petitions \ ] . the signers claim a maximum wage limit is key to limit the greed and corruption that occurs in american society due to all their leaders being owned by the corporations . investment bankers , hedge fund managers do not need millions or even billions of dollars per year \ [ moveon petitions \ ] . one may believe that hard work and dedication pays off in money and is how one gets rich . that thought could n’t be any farther from the truth . most jobs pay a fixed rate and this rate hardly ever changes regardless of how hard you work . investing is one key to getting rich , essentially , as you invest a certain amount of money for a company on the stock market \ [ bloomberg \ ] . the stock market is a collection of markets and exchanges where the giving and trading of stocks of publicly held companies , bonds , and other classes of securities take place \ [ investopedia \ ] . depending on how good the company does , the value of your stock can either increase and decrease . sounds like earning money could n’t be easier right ? wrong . investing is an extremely risky thing to do , people have lost everything from investing . while buying stocks for certain companies can allow a vast accumulation of wealth , this can also mean they can lose all the money just like that . for instance , the 2008 stock market crash occurred when a stock market industry known as dow jones representing the united states economy of industry , transportation and utilities fell 777.68 points ( dollars ) in intraday trading ( buying and selling financial instruments within the same trading day ) , the most in any single day in history \ [ the balance \ ] . less than 18 months later , the dow dropped below more than 50 % from 14,164.63 points to 6,594.44 points \ [ the balance \ ] . the aftermath saw the economy lose a total of 240,000 jobs were lost in 2008 and more than 10,000 people committed suicide due to the stock market crash \ [ the balance \ ] . this just goes to show even attempting to become wealthy without solving the wealth gap to guarantee people the chance to become wealthy is an extremely risky business . people literally killed themselves because they failed to get rich quick in a risky business . finally , there are loopholes the rich constantly find to avoid paying taxes . some examples include tax havens ( moving to places that do n’t tax anything ) , shell companies ( companies that only exist on paper ) , equity swapping ( switching mortgages with someone else ) , avoiding estate tax by technically not owning property and the list goes on \ [ accounting-degree \ ] . the easiest solution for these problems is once again , predistribution . the state has the power to choose where the income goes and the state would have the power to make these loopholes illegal , they can do things like simplifying the economy itself so everyone can understand how it works and gives less of a ground for the rich to manipulate . the market is only complicated because the rich make it . without the rich being able to define the market , the market would be defined by the average citizen in america , a much better alternative to the rich deciding on a complicated , easy to manipulate version of the market . in conclusion , the solution to the income disparity problem is predistribution along with the idea of the maximum wage limit being incorporated into the idea of predistribution . predistribution stops the potential for income disparity to occur in the first place , some other solutions like redistribution are n’t as great since it does n’t stop the income disparity , while other solutions like the maximum wage limit can be reinforced by predistribution , how following the rich people 's footsteps to becoming rich is extremely risky and how predistribution can help stop the rich from finding loopholes in the economy . predistribution along with a maximum wage limit leads the way to solving the income disparity issue .","i disagree with your entire premise and will hope to try to persuade you to the idea that , income equality via predistrobition , or redistribution of wealth , would be unfair . and that , income inequality in the united states is not unfair . we have a very high standard of living , and the majority of people make a good income . feeling bad that you are n't a millionaire and saying it 's unfair that joe is a millionaire when you have a home , good food to eat , a car , nice clothes , and so on . just because joe has all that plus a couple mansions , private airplane , a boat and other toys does n't mean it 's unfair that you do n't have those things . when monday roles around you 're going to put in your 40 hours for the week while joe is going to put an easy 90 , maybe more , because he owns the medium sized company you work for . now , let 's say whatever company this is goes the way of blockbuster , you get laid off . joe is liquading his business so he can atleast get enough money out to start another business down the line . you , on the other hand , can file for unemployment , along with other social warfare programs that we all as citizens of this country want you to use because this is the kind of use case the social safety net was made for . so you start your job search , and also when not going on interviews or looking for jobs you are working on your hobby creating custom furniture pieces from wood because you like doing that . so one day joe calls you , asks how your doing , and wants to check in on you . if you had some more w3 can start a business "" joe laughs while you open your garage to reveal all the peices of work you created . couple years later you and joe are partners on a furniture store , both of you are millionaires . you wrote a lot about potential solutions , and that there is an income gap . but you can bet your ass that they produced 500x more than the poor person . it 's about how much what you can produce is worth to other people . if you count second-order effects , bill gates is trillions of times more productive than the average person considering how much productivity windows and office have unlocked . i accept that income disparity exists , that it is growing , and that it has negative effects . your title merely says that income disparity is a big problem and needs to be fixed . you say that income disparity is a problem because the money people possess does not reflect the amount of effort they put in . i certainly agree that some people with money did n't work hard for it , and others work very hard and are still poor . if a person believes , as you do , that life should be fair , then it is a "" problem "" , because it goes against one of your values . me , i do n't think it 's possible for society to deliver justice to all , or to eliminate income disparity . your proposed solution essentially involves taking some money from people that are earning a lot and giving it to people who are n't . the most obvious one is that most people would n't work as hard . if you could make as much being a waitress at eighteen as you could being an accountant at twenty-two , why go to college and become an accountant when you could start earning money right away ? if you own your own business , and you have an idea for a great new invention , but you 're already at max income , why bust your ass working long hours to develop and sell the new invention ? why even work at all if unemployed people get "" predistribution "" , too , and you 're content with however much that is ? sure , some people would keep working hard because they 're selfless , but very few people are really like that . it is vital for our society that the most useful and talented people in the world keep putting in maximum effort , and a maximum income would seriously interfere with that . i 'm not going to go into historical examples of the leaders of communist societies abusing their power because it is n't directly related , but know that there are plenty of more practical hiccups , too . predistribution might work in a voluntary colony type situation where everyone agreed to it in advance , then left our society and formed an entirely new society in an isolated place , preferably another planet . either everyone would agree to live a simple agrarian life where innovation was n't necessary , or everyone would agree to try their best to keep innovating even without the incentive of money , simply because of their strong social bond to their peers . for best results , keep the groups small and elect no central leader . still not likely to work , but i think that 's the best chance you 've got . it can be a problem to be solved if your values tell you it is . out this into your perspective , 80 % of the world lives below the poverty line . it ’s not just in the united states , it ’s a world economic problem ."
9q9aty,"internet is being destroyed by corporate interests ajit pai sure ... but i feel like the government of the usa spent money developing the internet and gave it to the world and now the world which is based on markets and capitalism are all maneuvering to control it and as a side effect destroy the goal of what the internet was . people are beginning to talk about this issue . we used to have people like alex jones with ways to address that problem in a fair and open and public manner . now we have private companies who say you know what , we own this network and we do n't like you so you ca n't speak anymore . perfectly legal . ( full disclosure i am not an alex jones fan . i did think he was interesting on the rogan podcast ... but infowars ... get out of here . ) obviously i could just not watch infowars but we seem to be somehow going down this odd path where private companies control what we see rather then the government . people seem to be pivoting to trust private companies more than their own elected government . i do n't see this is a good trend . am i wrong here ? is the internet being destroyed by the corporate world ? & #x200b ; still do n't understand reddit . i ca n't respond in general but need to update here . so update : re-read these posts a few times . even the negative comments . thanks all for trying . there seems to be an idea that government is bad and should be so small and powerless that any private company can do what it wants and this will somehow be good . we as people elect our government and have some control and interaction with it . as an example i was on a personal mission with netflix to allow vpns as i enjoy privacy . ( simply for that reason . ) i am almost always behind a vpn if not two . ( blame snowden ) its not perfect . its a measure i take to help with privacy . i got no where with netflix . i had several support tickets . i tried their chat system . i wrote a physical letter . their response was always we do n't support vpns . if you use a vpn it breaks our ability to deliver content , please disable your vpn . ( you can watch netflix fine over a vpn but they actively hunt and block your ability to watch their service over a vpn . ) i own shares of netflix . ( like 1 share and i bought it when they were like $ 80 ... if only i knew then what i know now . ) but even being a shareholder and paying for their service i have no control or voice in a private company . senators and congressman will respond to my letters and i could meet with them if needed . we could pass legislation to deal with this problem . all of this and i love netflix . i pay for their service . i could pirate all of their content and not pay them but i do n't yet they do n't care about my voice on this issue . and they are generally an innocuous and benign entity . facebook/twitter and google are where 70 % of people get their news and content . they are both providing a means to experience the internet while destroying it . imho . i know interest in this topic has waned but still interested in your views . banning that one guy from a starbucks does n't really address the alex jones issue . it seems like a straw man . no one is not going to go to youtube anymore because a video they host makes them feel in danger . you can just block alex jones . it seems like a far left argument who want youtube to be a safe space . the fact that net neutrality is gone and you think the internet has n't changed or is n't going to change or that is a decided fate means you are not really following that issue . we need a neutral , profit free entity . you would n't even have the internet already if not for the government . ( you thought i was going to say al gore did n't you ? ) much love all .","your angle about the govt vs. private companies is a little questionable though , since things get cheaper and better when private companies run things while the government makes things worse and more expensive . it is inherently benificial not just for the company , but also for the consumer that everybody uses just one or two forms of social media . ( you could also add youtube for video makers ) this obviously creates a monopoly . imo the best solution would be to take social media open source . each company can have its own rules on what it does and does not allow . however , you can search profiles from any host , friend them and ( if they accept ) then message them like you can in facebook . not a soul would complain if that coffee shop banned him from the shop . nobody has prevented you from watching alex jones on his own website where he 's making his own living . that 's just the free market at work , not the destruction of the internet . yeah sounds like a great way to censor your internet from things you do n't want people to see ."
9q8mm3,"current us campaign finance laws basically get things right i think we need a system of campaign finance regulations which absolutely preserve the rights of individuals to engage in independent political speech . rather than getting into precisely why i think freedom of speech ought to be protected , i think it 'll be more productive and directly to the point to give a short list of examples of speech i want to be protected and which i think the vast majority of people would agree should be free from government interference . > kojo nnamdi 's npr show where politics are routinely discussed , and corporations donating to npr , or specifically donating to fund kojo 's show . > hbo airing real time and last week tonight , and hbo paying to have their content distributed by cable companies or other platforms . > comedy central airing south park 's more political episodes , and advertisers buying time specifically during south park . > planned parenthood putting out a commercial wading into a debate over their value , and corporations donating to planned parenthood . > cato institute paying an honorarium to a speaker , filming the speaker , putting the video on youtube , advertisers placing ads on that video , and cato paying to advertise the video on facebook . to clarify a couple a terms : political : let 's call this anything dealing with an issue which has or may reasonably be the subject of legislation . it 's pretty broad , but that 's because politics reaches damn near everything . not to be confused with electioneering . electioneering : specifically calling for people to vote a certain way . independent : not part of an official campaign . they may have interests aligned with a certain candidate , and may be actively working to help a certain candidate , but this is any activity which is not under the candidate 's direction or control . bribery : for purposes of this conversation , let 's keep bribery to quid-pro-quo agreements . and yes , it 's already illegal -- as well it should be . speech : this is the difficult one . obviously people directly expressing an idea is speech , whether with words or symbolic speech . with that last one , we get to the heart of the issue , is money speech ? i want to put that question into more exact terms : should money spent to enable or amplify speech be afforded the same protection as speech ? my answer is yes . i have a journal , i 'd like to spend a few bucks a month to buy a domain to host a blog . i think it 's pretty coherent to argue that this economic transaction ought to be generally afforded the same protections as the speech itself . for example , if the government said "" no spending money on blogs that attack the president , "" i doubt many people would say "" well , ya know , money is n't speech ; you can talk all you want , but you ca n't buy a website to talk on . "" likewise , if i advertise on the blog to raise money to pay for that , i think that should be allowed , and sponsors should be able to choose me specifically because they like what i have to say . i think the larger "" money is ( n't ) speech "" idea is basically just a scaled up version of that . and just to clarify one last thing , i do n't think the system is perfect . i think no system hoping to balance competing interests ( free speech vs. not having disproportionately loud voices ) will be perfect . my position is we get very close to the best balance though . the biggest room for improvement i see is more voices and cheaper ways to communicate . basically the direction we 're headed in . the less it takes money to be heard , the less impact having money has . with fewer people watching tv ( where ads typically are aimed ) , and stuff like ad blockers getting around a lot of online stuff , it 's just getting harder to pay to reach an audience anyways . i would promote a whole lot more development of these tools and more people using them . on the legislative side , i would like more strict rules about independence of pacs , but i 'm not sure what that 'd look like . obvious thing is something like "" if you were employed by a campaign in the last 2 years you ca n't hold an executive or managerial position in any organization engaged in political speech , "" but damn ... like i said early on , almost all speech is going to end up being arguably political speech . i do n't think i want to rule out a career campaign adviser leaving to become the chief fundraising officer for the bill and melinda gates foundation or something . i think there 's probably room for improvement here , but it 's a tough needle to thread . i 'd also raise the maximum individual donation . the extremely wealthy are going to have their voices heard regardless of a $ 2,700 cap . the people actually capped are the upper-middle and lower-upper class . i 'd double or triple the amount they can give . yes , it 's "" more money in politics , "" but if that 's how people want to spend their savings i think that 's admirable . and more importantly , it lets people further down the economic ladder provide more of a balance to the people at the very top . might not be a big improvement , but i doubt it 'll hurt much . one last thing i 'll mention , i 'd probably be okay with some sort of rule that limits bundling ( where one person is authorized to direct many other people 's campaign donations ) , but like everything else , i think there 's also a legitimate place for this , and i do n't want to throw the baby out with the bath water .","non-candidates may not make political ads during the election run-up period , only during non-election periods , and may either endorse a specific candidate/issue or denounce a specific candidate/issue , but not both in the same ad . ads placed online must be taken down/made private during the election run-up period . nope , the biggest room for improvement is for voters to let politicians know , with their vote , that corruption will not be tolerated . you say that the us gets the balance between free speech and political corruption basically right - including and especially around election campaigns . we do n’t have specific political advertising for or against some candidates on tv , we do n’t have televised debates between candidates and we have no significant private money going to political campaigns . before an election parties present programs , politicians give interviews and they hang posters all around the city . after the election parties get reimbursed by the state for their campaign related expenses . i realize that these conditions have at least as much to do with our political culture and tradition as they have with laws and regulations but it nonetheless creates an environment conducive to actual , issue driven debate and practically devoid of any smear campaigns or cults of personality . in my opinion the us would be well served to at least aim to recreate this situation . this could be achieved by banning pacs , explicit political advertising on tv and social media and limiting campaign contributions to very small private donations ( ~ 100 $ or so ) . furthermore , parties should be reimbursed for their expenses in accordance with the share of votes they received . losing your democracy to special interests and having your discourse turned into a circus can not be justified by some technical appeal to the nature of free speech , right ? i am going to presume that you do n’t believe the wealthy are some how more deserving to be heard by the elected government , and if that is n’t the case the rest of this is all for moot . too few people have their voice heard within the american system of campaign finance and all parts of the electoral process , increasing the individual limit wo n’t all of the sudden make campaigns more inclusive in how they finance their campaigns , just the same individuals slightly readjusting how much they would be contributing . the über-wealthy would still give the max amount plus whatever additional ways they could affect public policy in their favor or to their whims , the lower-upper class and upper-middle class would still be maxing out though some of those individuals wo n’t be spending $ 7,000 per candidate and was barely able to make the $ 2,700 limit , so your proposal to increase limits just drowns out those at the bottom of the top 0.001 % who were making maximum contributions . and if the vast majority of americans ca n’t afford $ 1,000 for emergencies , doubling down on the current campaign finance system will just make it less inclusive to those hundreds of millions of americans who could never afford to make a $ 1,000 contribution to their preferred candidate ( s ) . i would propose a legal distinction that electioneering be held to a different standard than any other political speech , and barring all electioneering from individuals/people who are not registered to vote . also direct contributions to candidates would be limited to democracy vouchers that have already been implemented in seattle local elections with significant success to broaden the support at the earliest stage of a candidates campaign and curtail the influence of big dollar donors . free speech and political speech would still continue as is , campaign finance of candidates would drastically be changed for the better , making the electoral process all the more inclusive and dependent on the political whims of the districts ’ constituents instead of the incredibly small and exclusive set of big dollar donors . one could be a billionaire and run ads to “ call elected official so-so and ask them when did they stop beating their spouse ? ” or whatever else they want to , but keeping the candidates finances tightly bound to the voters goes a long way to resolving the problem of too few citizens participating at the inception of a candidacy and removing the big dollar donor capability to filter candidates not to their liking . this is a modern problem , since before mass communication , electioneering was incredibly labor intensive , where campaign staff/supporter would make many speeches on the candidate ’s behalf to town ’s squares . the corruption that the founding fathers were concerned for ( and every good government reformer until modern campaigns ) was bribery towards the voters themselves . the wealthy would hand over a big bag of cash to a corrupt political machine , let ’s take tammany hall for instance , and that political machine would then ensure that for local offices the electorate would corrupted by giving them free meals and booze at speeches in town square paid for by the wealthy individuals that determined who would be the local elected officials . prior to 1884 , voters had to publicly declare who they were voting for , making the possibility of their vote bought by the political machines all the more effective since they could tell who actually “ earned ” their bribe . the first hundred years of american democracy had no secret ballot and on several states it remains a misdemeanor to photograph your ballot to ensure that you ’ve delivered a bought vote to someone else . i give these historical examples as hyperbolic worst case scenarios , but you could see how this type of corruption could be reformed and stopped , but then get replaced with radio/television ads that would forgo the direct bribery to voters and have an intermediary step that is an element of political speech . with democracy vouchers , it would force the prospective candidate to reach out to as many constituents as possible to garner their support via the voucher , and there is no benefit to seeking out the support of the wealthy donors though they obviously remain looming large in the process because they can still buy ads and influence news outlets with their wealth . it ’s not a perfect solution to the exclusivity to american campaign finance but it is far better at making the financing of the electoral process more democratic than the status quo . the government is still allowed to restrict speech if there is a compelling government interest ( e.g. you ca n't cause a panic by shouting "" fire ! "" to learn more , i would strongly recommend republic , lost by lawrence lessig and affluence & influence by martin gilens . they go in depth on the extent to which money is corrupting the political process . it shows how the government is completely unresponsive to the policy preferences of people at the 50th income percentile , but nicely responsive to the policy preferences of the 90th income percentile and above . while you should read the books , i honestly think that graph is all you should need to be convinced that the current amount of money in politics is a problem . to reiterate : public policy is completely unresponsive to the concerns of people at the median income , but very responsive to the economic elite . is n't the point of a democracy to have a government that is responsive to the concerns of all people ? the proposals i 've seen would give each citizen some fixed amount of money that could only be donated to campaigns , and if a candidate accepts other money then this public money is closed to them . this already exists to a certain extent with the $ 3 tax checkoff for the presidential election campaign fund , and it also exists to a certain extent in some states . public funding seems like it would make things better because it would give more citizens a voice in the same way that the wealthy currently have a voice . the problem it addresses is that many citizens can not currently afford to make campaign donations in any meaningful way . as for loopholes , i 'm sure it would depend on precisely how the rules were worded ."
9q872b,"the minimum wage should be abolished i view minimum wage as a detriment to society . it is my view that minimum w does more harm than good to a community by sacrificing the number of jobs available to increase the well being of select individuals . furthermore , i do n't think that the government is capable of setting an hourly wage that is "" fair "" as fair is subjective and varies wildly by region and by career . if i open a clothing store , and i need to hire a cashier . i should pay said cashier a salary that is representative of the value said cashier brings to me and my store . assume that i can afford to pay the cashier is $ 30,000 a year ( about $ 15 an hour ) for the value they bring to the store . then that 's what i pay the aforementioned cashier . let 's say that the minimum wage becomes $ 40,000 a year ( $ 20 an hour ) due to new legislation . i now have a choice : either i somehow find a way to make an additional $ 10,000 dollars this year , or i let my cashier go and take over the register myself . as automation technology matures , i may have the third choice to upgrade to an all-digital system . -- url -- notice how in that scenario the minimum wage increase was not passed with my clothing store in mind . whether or not i actually had $ 10,000 dollars in annual revenue just lying around was never considered . after all , it is impossible for the government to do that for every small business . and yet its somehow fair for me to deal with the consequences regardless of how my business is actually doing . in that scenario , the flick of a government pen has legislated away a job . and that scenario happens all the time when minimum wage increases are implemented . -- url -- please note : i am in favor of basic income . i am seeking good arguments in favor of the minimum wage .","if you need a cashier , you are asking for a human to spend their time and energy in your place . they deserve a wage that recognises they 're a human . if they work 40 hours per week for you , regardless of the value they bring , they deserve a wage that covers their cost of living . if you believe your cashier is worth less than a human , either do n't hire a human or build a robot to do the job . \ > let 's say that the minimum wage becomes $ 40,000 a year ( $ 20 an hour ) due to new legislation \ > i now have a choice : either i somehow find a way to make an additional $ 10,000 dollars this year , or i let my cashier go and take over the register myself i 'd much rather your cashier has that $ 10,000 dollars to cover their rising costs of living than for you to have it to buy another sports car . if you value humans so little that you wo n't even pay them a living wage , then sure , automation is the way to go . currently the american minimum wage is 7.25 , not even half what it should be to have a roof over your head and food on the table . i know i 'm being harsh here and maybe a bit triggering , but a minimum wage is not an economic issue , it 's a moral issue . i do n't disagree with the point that a minimum wage may result in a loss of employment opportunity for some , at least temporarily , but i think this is well worth it . paying less than a living wage is rent-seeking behavior and is harmful for the economy . let 's say , you own a fleet of trucks as part of your moving business . it costs so much to keep the gas tanks full and to keep the fleet maintained . would it be in anyway a good argument to insist that others pay for half of your gas and maintenance because you ca n't afford to stay in business and pay these costs ? you would likely tell this hypothetical business owner to manage their efficiencies . the business owner should charge more , use more efficient routes , or use fewer trucks . there is no way that outsourcing these costs is good for the economy . he 's using resources inefficiently these trucks and their labor can be used more effectively elsewhere . if the business owner can not figure out how to pay for the fleet , then it is best for everyone that he shut his doors . it costs so much to feed and house them . using their saleable labor , but not paying adequately for it , causes a net cost to society . the only reason employers get away with this is that we tend to have more compassion for our fellow humans than a fleet of trucks . now , you may say , "" any job is better than none at all "" and that allowing people to underpay labor and making up the difference is better than having to pay all expenses for an unemployed person . i think it is probably okay to have a tiered minimum wage . ie : you may pay minors less to give an incentive to hire them and provide work experience . this could also go for perhaps the first year of total work experience of any given individual , regardless of age . tl/dr : minimum wage acts as a standard of efficiency and it is beneficial to the economy to have ( a reasonable ) one . if a business requires a workforce to survive but ca n’t pay that workforce enough to feed and shelter themselves , then that business is either incompetent or exploitative . yes , a minimum wage is useful to ensure people have a wage level that affords them the ability to provide for themselves and live with dignity . however , it is also extremely useful to prevent firms from exploiting the government . nobody knows the value some individual will bring to your store . so there may be many reasons for or against a minimum wage , but the value somebody allegedly brings to your business is not a valid one . in my opinion an ever higher minumum wage would increases domestic demand and reduce inequality , boost the economy untill all capacities are used and only then drive up inflation , the latter would be the signal to stop that sort of evil socialst policies . labor supply for low skill jobs , the jobs that pay minimum wage , is highly saturated . if the minimum wage were abolished , then the average wage of workers would go down , because there would be someone willing to do the same work for less , not because they can survive off of that amount , but because even if they do n't make enough money to pay for food , a roof , and other basic needs or even luxuries , making just enough to pay for just food leaves them better off than they were before . just because someone is willing to work for an amount of money does n't mean employers should be allowed to pay them that , because they do n't have a choice in working . the minimum wage protects workers from each other , it keeps them from driving their own salaries so far down that they can barely pay for bare necessities like food and water . businesses do n't pay workers based on what they are worth to the company , they pay them as little as possible , so long as they are worth more to the company that the amount that they pay them . what you are arguing is that the poor would be better off with no minimum wage . there is no strong economic consensus on the effects of minimum wage , generally . there is reasonable consensus that if monopsony ( monopoly of demand ) exists a minimum wage can be useful , though . no one can say for sure how much disemployment minimum wage causes . but due to new legislation you need to free them , they have to decide to work for you of their own free will , and you have to pay sallary . notce that freeing slaves was never considered with my poor plantation in mind . and yet it 's somehow fair for me to deal with consequences regardless of my plantation is actually doing . but some people have no choice but to work minimum wage jobs . why do you think people will work in sweatshops in china even though they are paid poorly and treated poorly ? it 's the whole reason why the minimum wage was created in the first place : to limit the amount of exploitation of the labor force . we get people not paid enough to survive because there will always be more employees for minimum wage jobs than openings . not a wage example , but if we ca n’t trust the private sector to protect its employees from literal immolation while on the job , how can we trust them to self regulate wages ? the problem with the "" minimum wage "" argument as its presented like this is that it only looks at one part of the problem - how much a business thinks it can pay its employees and still be profitable . this , however , dramatically oversimplifies what an economy is and leaves out a major factor that plays into this system - how many consumers there are to fuel that business and others . so if the lifeblood of an economy is the flow of money , then it is very important we do n't allow stagnation - we do n't allow the money to clot because that will lead to necrosis - businesses will fail because there are n't enough customers . people need to feel secure in their work , stability in their lives without fear of having to live paycheque to paycheque , not worrying about how they 're going to get their next meal or feed their kids - they need to have a comfortable income in order to have enough free money left over to then spend on products . regardless of how much skill there may be in any particular job , if you 're working normal business hours at any given location you 're giving them hours of your day that ca n't go into anything else which could make you money , feed yourself , pay the rent , etc. . money stops flowing , businesses have to lay off employees or they go under , less money is entering the system so less money is flowing through the system . the tentpoles of economic growth are not the spending of a few people making investments they never liquidate , the tentpoles of economic growth are not the handful of luxury item sales - the tentpoles of economy growth and a healthy economy are the bulk purchases of everyday commodities and services from average people . businesses across the board need to pay employees enough to make a comfortable living without fear of instability , because that 's when they are free to spend . ubi can assist with that , and may eventually be the longterm solution to automation and the changing economy - however , we still have plenty of opportunity for blue and white collar work , the problem is that larger businesses who only account for bottom lines in the short term such as walmart , amazon , etc. . lower minimum incomes for the working class are short sighted and hurts everyone . speaking as a store manager , i do n't think the hypothetical situation where a modest minimum wage increase forces me to lay off an employee reflects reality . as an employer i have a demand for employees to work and do things in and around the store to make it function . if this demand is n't properly filled , my store ca n't function as well as it needs to and higher minimum wage is the least of my problems . if this demand is filled , i have no interest in spending money on work hours that i do n't need . anything beyond that has severe diminishing returns in terms of value per work hour and is not worth it , not just for the price but also the extra overhead and possibility that employees simply get bored with overly specialized tasks . the only argument i can think of in favor of it would be to gain a competitive edge ( more work hours = more time for details and extra service ) , but if i could hire someone for peanuts to dance for the customers then so could my competitor and we 'd be back to square one . changes to the minimum wage would really only affect the cost of maintaining just the amount of staff that i need . charitably , i could reinvest the reduced employee upkeep into other parts of the store . realistically , if there was something to invest in that i had reason to believe would improve the store and subsequently the profits , i 've probably already done it , cheap wages or not . this is why i do n't think lower or no minimum wage would create jobs in any meaningful sense . i think raising it might cost some jobs , but that if so , those businesses were hiring inefficiently and superfluously to begin with , and would not have had that many employees with more competent management . now , if i were to hire a new employee , i also would not pay them "" representative of the value they bring to my store "" as you do in your example . not because i 'm evil and unfair , but because the value they bring to my store is simultaneously everything ( i need your time and effort or i would n't be hiring ) and nothing ( i 'm probably hiring any halfway competent and motivated uneducated worker , i do n't need you specifically ) . really , i 'm neck deep in budgets and sales figures but i have no way to tell what any one individual employee personally contributes to the numbers because that 's not how it works . i ca n't quantify the overall profit a cashier/stocker adds to my business , i just know whether or not i need one . or rather , we start at or near minimum wage , because i 'm hiring uneducated workers in a saturated job market and "" this is as low as you can legally go "" is usually the applicant 's only bargaining chip . it does n't matter if you ultimately contribute many times your upkeep in terms of "" value "" to the business . you have no bargaining chip , you take minimum wage or i keep looking . this is why i think the idea that employees , especially uneducated workers are paid according to their value ( as in , contribution to profits ) to a business is not only wrong but harmful . minimum wage does not force businesses to pay them more than they are worth , rather it prevents businesses from low-balling wages past a certain point ."
9q5a37,"women who 've been sexually assaulted should take justice into thier own hands . i think one of the biggest failures of modern american culture is the oppression of women 's self defense . to be fair i am a very large ( 6 ' 3 "" 230 lbs ) man in my 20s but every time i hear of a rape or sexual assault against a woman i always have a certain frustration as to why these men never get properly punished . i know the burden of proof on rape , harassment and sexual assault is very difficult to prove . not to sound too edgy , but if anyone had wronged me like that , took away my power and made me a victim , i would try my absolute best to make them pay in some way . also in my view i believe all it would take is two or three high profile cases of vigilante justice before there would be a change in american rape culture . public pressure for more not to happen would force police to have new ways to investigate rape and assault cases and predatory men would be more wary and careful with consent if they thought bad things would happen if they were n't . tl ; dr : women taking vengeful action against their abusers would change the system , rape culture and discourage future abusers .","to the extent that i want justice , what i want is for them to realize what they 've done , fix the things within them that made them think it was okay , and never hurt anyone again . i realize that other survivors want their rapists in prison/paying them restitution and i respect that , but the closest thing to vigilante justice i 've seen advocated or practiced is naming and shaming abusers . vigilante justice puts all the onus on the victim when , really , survivors should n't be responsible for protecting themselves or going after abusers . you 're sort of laying responsibility on them to make sure the rapist does n't rape any more women . most of the women i know have faced sexual assault or rape at some point and none of them have even pressed charges , for a variety of reasons . and even when women press charges they are often dismissed so as to not "" ruin a mans future "" or some bullshit . really it comes down to fellow men sticking up for women and not perpetuation rape culture by allowing rape jokes or talking objectively about women . it also takes women looking out for women ( though , we are usually pretty good about that ) . no , it would just motivate rapist to kill their victim right after they rape them . as a bonus , the person can not provide any testimony against you or talk to the police or anyone else regarding the rape . you are trivializing and incredibly complex and difficult and traumatic situation into few sentences . well not a trivial number of people raped experience ptsd from this event . if you ever experienced a post traumatic stress disorder , triggered by any action even remotely similar to that event . and someone else says "" just get over it "" . this is just one of the problems that might have happen to rape victims , where you could n't take justice in your own hand , even if you wanted to ."
9q4ms9,"to vote for a republican in a national election , someone must be either ignorant or immoral i would prefer not to hold people with whom i disagree in low regard , so i am not comfortable with this view that i have . please help me change it . i ca n’t understand how people can vote for republicans without being either ignorant or immoral . first i ’ll define those terms , then i ’ll explain the immorality that i see . “ ignorant ” is the default condition of a voter . most voters from both parties fall into this category . this is the guy who does n’t know that republicans want to lower taxes on the rich while democrats want to either raise them or keep them the same . this guy just votes based on how other people in his community are voting or for whichever candidate “ feels ” right to him . again , most voters from both parties fall into this group . i ’ll also include as “ ignorant ” those who conform to the leftist caricatures of trump supporters . these are the people who genuinely believed that trump is a great businessman , even though great businessmen do n’t go bankrupt six times . they think that building a wall will actually stop illegal immigration . they believed trump when he said that the latter would n’t benefit from his own tax plan . i wo n't discuss this group any further because they 're not putting any thought into their decisions , which i believe makes the discussion less interesting . “ immoral ” refers to people who significantly discount the wellbeing of people outside their immediate ( 10-50 people ) circle of loved ones . that ’s my careful way of saying , “ they do n’t care about anyone except for themselves , their family , and a few close friends . ” i ’ll pause for a moment here to mention that i believe hanlon ’s razor is a useful heuristic , i.e. i believe that some number of people who support the immoral republicans positions i am about to condemn are people who are simply not competent enough to understand that they are immoral . there is a tricky ethical question here about whether someone who does not understand that their actions are immoral is culpable for them . let ’s save that discussion for another thread , and for now just assume either that they are culpable in that way or that we can ignore them in this discussion . ----- enough preamble : why do i think the non-ignorant people who advocate for republican policies must be immoral ? democracy republicans are in the midst of a concerted effort to undermine democracy through gerrymandering , voter suppression , and big money . in the 2016 election , republican candidates for the house of representatives won 49 % of all votes cast , but ended up with 55 % of the seats in the house , thanks to gerrymandered districts that look like this . republicans are in the middle of a multi-year drive to reduce voter participation by passing voter id laws and closing poling places . in private , they have admitted that these policies are meant to improve their odds of winning elections . the republican judiciary has gone out of its way to exacerbate the problem by repealing campaign finance laws and repealing the voting rights act in 5-4 decisions . i find single-issue voting to be irrational ; each issue should receive be weighted in accordance with its importance and all issues should be considered . that being said , if democracy does n’t work , we might as well give up on everything else , right ? should n’t our weight on this be astronomically high ? is n’t the preservation of our democracy a moral imperative ? climate change climate change is an existential threat , and every little bit of action will help . although a scenario in which climate change does no damage is not possible , the difference between limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 ° instead of 2.0 ° is estimated at 150 million lives and trillions of dollars . unsurprisingly , if we do nothing , we will not meet that target . instead , if we do nothing we expect a 4.0 ° rise . republicans want to do nothing . from their 2016 platform : “ we oppose any carbon tax . ” … “ the united nations ' intergovernmental panel on climate change is a political mechanism , not an unbiased scientific institution . its unreliability is reflected in its intolerance toward scientists and others who dissent from its orthodoxy . we will evaluate its recommendations accordingly . we reject the agendas of both the kyoto protocol and the paris agreement , which represent only the personal commitments of their signatories ; no such agreement can be binding upon the united states until it is submitted to and ratified by the senate . ” … “ we demand an immediate halt to u.s. funding for the u.n. 's framework convention on climate change ( unfccc ) in accordance with the 1994 foreign relations authorization act . ” again , i find single-issue voting to be irrational , but should n’t the weight of hundreds of millions of deaths be really , really high ? is n’t it a moral imperative to try to save those lives ? corruption the trump administration might be the most corrupt in history and the republican congress is doing nothing to see whether or not that ’s the case . trump is hiding his finances , which means we do n’t know from whom he is receiving money . in other words , it is , in principle , quite easy to bribe him . we know of one such instance of bribery ( or , at least , a large cash gift to gain favor ) in the form of a $ 270,000 payment from saudi arabia ( supposedly as a payment for hotel rooms ) . there might be more . there might not be . whatever the case , we do n’t know , because republicans are refusing to force trump to be transparent about his finances . republicans are also refusing to take the mueller investigation seriously . the head of the house “ investigation ” was clearly just trying to cover for trump ( here ’s another source , and another ! ) . both paul ryan and mitch mcconnell have repeatedly refused to protect the mueller investigation from potential interference by trump . please note that , in the above , i am not presuming trump ’s guilt ( except for his violations of the emoluments clause , which are incredibly obvious ) . i am saying that there is reasonable suspicion of corruption and investigations are required . this does n’t receive the same “ existential threat ” weighting that the previous two categories do , but i ’m still including it here because there is an undeniable right answer and the republicans are refusing to act on it . is n’t guarding against corruption a moral imperative ? ----- i tend to disagree with most other republican policies on the merits , but i ’m able to see them as questions of competing values , rather than fundamental immorality . however , on questions of democracy , climate change , and corruption republicans appear incontrovertibly wrong under every reasonable value system , so that is why i am focusing here . plus , climate change and democratic backsliding represent existential threats to our way of life . how to change my view i think there are two ways to do it : 1 ) you can try to convince me that other issues ( such as taxes and healthcare ) actually have a greater moral weight than those i have listed above and therefore someone might feel obligated to vote on the basis of those other issues , or 2 ) you can try to convince me that i ’m wrong to think that democratic backsliding and/or climate change are existential threats and/or that there is reasonable suspicion to investigate trump ’s potential corruption . that being said , the best way to change my view is to present something i ’ve never even thought of ! :) ----- i will try to anticipate one objection : abortion . i understand that there are a non-trivial number of people who feel it is morally necessary to support the pro-life candidate because they view abortion as murder and stopping over a half million murders per year seems like a reasonable moral goal . this is where appropriate weighting matters . climate change , left unmitigated , will kill hundreds of millions . in other words , it ’s a greater threat to human life than abortion , even if we assume that abortion is murder . and , if that ’s not enough , please notice that the abortion rate has been falling since 1981 , even under democratic party control ( some would say especially under democratic party control , but that 's less clear ) .","“ despite what we often hear about the deep divisions between parties , we found that there is actually general agreement that climate change is real , that human activity causes climate change , and that we should do something about it , ” said van boven . participants read a fictional proposed policy , either a cap-and-trade policy commonly supported by democrats or a revenue-neutral carbon tax largely favored by republicans . the researchers informed participants that 95 % of republicans and 10 % of democrats supported the policy , or vice versa . regardless of the version they read , democrats supported a policy when democrats promoted it , and republicans supported the gop-backed proposal . when asked whether they would write an email to their congressional representative in support of the policy , participants were more likely to say yes when the policy was supported by their own party . so could it be that the sneering attitude democrats often take toward republican voters , e.g. clinton 's "" basket of deplorables "" comment or your statement that they must be ignorant or immoral , is actually what 's preventing movement on issues like climate change ? assuming for a moment that the trump administration is the most corrupt in history , which administrations come in second and third , and on what basis ? tl ; dr ( 1 ) it is n't important who exactly you 're voting for as long as the system of checks and balances works , and both democrats and republicans are fully in support of it . ( 2 ) if it starts to seem that your political opponents are stupid or evil , you 've unfortunately fallen under the influence of a number of very common biases that plague us all , mostly stemming from group identity . for example , both trump and obama tried to befriend russia ( cf. obama 's 2009 "" russian reset "" ; trump 's attempts come after ukraine/donbass war , whereas obama 's came after the georgia/ossetia war — i.e. situations were actually almost exactly the same , including russian attempts at election interference , which started around 1950s and never ceased ) and neither was allowed to continue for reasons outside their control . in other words , even presidents as dissimilar as trump and barack obama both ended up doing roughly the same thing . the only meaningful difference between democrats and republicans is that one is not the other and vice versa ; otherwise , for the general voter , they 're exactly the same . their in-group markers are different ( and very much solidified : you will notice that all voters of a particular group strongly believe in exactly the same list of mostly arbitrary things ) , but that 's entirely irrelevant due to the system of checks and balances that forces all elected officials to act pretty much the same . as a rule of thumb , if it starts to seem that your ideological opponents are either ignorant or evil , you 're suffering from the common collection of biases and are speaking from group identity rather than rationality ; these biases are healthy in the sense that almost everyone is subject to them , but they are anything but productive in the complex world of the 21st century . sometimes a person is stupid and/or evil ; but half the country , especially of a modern democratic first-world country , is unlikely to be . i think for your position to hold , you necessarily must discount the real fear in your fellow citizens . some who have studied america 's historical international policy may come to the fearful conclusion that , given the range of atrocities and disruption in so many countries , there 's always the chance of retribution through immigration and sleeper agents ( which sounds ridiculous , i know ) . considering the effectiveness of domestic terrorists , imagine mass movement of people with ( relative ) actual bones to pick . maybe "" single issue voters "" are n't the norm , but issues can be inter-related , and those who care a lot about one can forgive the flaws in the others . now from the scientific perspective , yes , that company deserves to fail ( assuming the d platform intends to correct a decades-old malpractice like rampant pollution ) . you have n't accounted for chronic/acute mental health problems like depression and substance dependancy . this guy probably lives paycheck to paycheck , and can not be there for his family and work multiple jobs after a layoff . he 's probably overweight from decades of inept and/or corruption in the under-regulated food industry . he ca n't escape the toxic masculinity he was raised in , so he 's repressed and depressed ; he defines himself by his job since that 's the only tangible thing he sees himself as contributing to the world . there is a wide range of situations which demand that he stay ignorant by making the moral choice of prioritizing a family in need . to set up your view with an "" or "" statement is an unfair way to get around this case , since you can condemn people for doing the "" right "" thing with their personal time . what follows now is a wider problem though , to participate in the 2 party system is ignorant at best . while we can agree that rs keep topping themselves with self-serving governance and blatant corruption , ds have done terrible things to maintain the class status quo ( and recover general domestic damage caused by r terms ) : choosing "" the lesser of two evils "" is a cop-out , since ds win when they pander to portions of the r 's base . for example clinton 's 3 strikes rule won over ignorant voters , and kept the prison population trending upward thanks to the unresolved war on drugs ( and other cultural/racial issues ) . obama 's post-r domestic rebuild , as is tradition , came at the political cost of maintaining international r wars : drones save their country 's soldiers , but their use has caused civilian deaths , not to mention the mental effects on non-combatants ( developing kids can tell when a drone is in the sky , imagine growing up with that ) . to vote d or r in 2016 was , to some degree , to be ignorant and immoral , as it was in 2012 , 04 , 00 , ' 96 ... you do n't have a government problem , you always have had a cultural and/or 2 party system problem . again with the lesser of two evils defense , "" but i would be throwing my vote away on independent parties since they have no viability "" is still an implicit acceptance of the evils of ds . maintaining the meta cost the 2016 election , since suppressing 3rd/4th party viability contributed to low voter turnout . single greatest reason why this is even a problem today is the anti nuclear movement in the 70s-80s that stopped decarbonisation of the economy and that was not a position of the gop or conservatives.also thanks to fracking ( that democrats oppose all the time ) us has ended reliance on coal as primary source of power and foreign oil and now usa is reducing emissions faster than western europe while growing at around 2x the speed . climate change has sadly been politicized to the extent when proposing retrofits to old coal plants to become combined cycle or other ways to boost the kwh/kg of co2 you are called denier because you show that current renewables are not scalable enough to take entire grid load off conventional power plants . you talk about gerrymandering and such as reasons why republicans are immoral , but the democrats do all of this stuff too , hell , the democrats have even managed to make gerrymandering a legal requirement in one state , making sure that there are district with a majority of us minorities . at the end of the day , some people care about issues more than others . so , no , not everyone who disagrees with you on a few big issues is immoral . automatically saying some one is either ignorant or immoral for coming to a different conclusion is just blatantly wrong . saying democrats do something as well as republicans obviously does not make the act right in the first place , but since your claim is that voting for specifically republicans is ignorant for these reasons , then you must accept that voting democrat is equally ignorant and immoral . if you 're under the impression that democrats do n't gerrymander or enact other policies to help them win elections then i 'm afraid you 're the ignorant one . further , democrats love requiring ids for exercising basic constitutional rights , just not the constitutional rights that they like . in order to exercise my second amendment right , i need to not only present a state id , but also pass a background check that can take up to a week to complete , thanks to democrat lawmakers . if using policy to help you win elelctions and requiring ids to exercise basic rights is enough for you to call voting for a party ignorant or immoral , then i sincerely hope you did n't vote democrat . the paris climate agreement basically amounted to giving china and india billions of dollars on the promise that they will reduce their emissions , with no safeguards other than the un 's limp-wristed retribution . it was a thoroughly bad deal , and even if you liked it , backing out of it is hardly ignorant or immoral . if we want to talk about stonewalling efforts to reduce climate change , let 's look at democrats ' efforts to halt as many nuclear energy plants as they can , purely based on irrational fear . instead democrats prefer way more inefficient methods of energy , such as solar panels , the production of which produces a waste product called silicon tetrachloride , which is far more toxic than depleted uranium , and unlike depleted uranium which can be re-enriched and reused , can only be dumped ( usually in china ) and left to rot the earth its in . if standing against green energy efforts to reduce emissions is enough for you to call voting for a certain party ignorant or immoral , then i sincerely hope you did n't vote democrat . the investigation has been ongoing basically since before the election and trump has made no effort to stop it . saying that mcconnell and ryan are corrupt for not protecting an investigation that is not in danger of being stopped is nonsense . to my knowledge , the only one who 's really been hit by the investigation is manafort , over some finance infractions unrelated to trump 's administration . and here 's another "" rubber and glue "" for you , hillary clinton was also receiving funding from saudi arabia , and was got paid six figures for giving a speech at goldman sachs . so if getting funds from foreign countries and corporate special interests is enough for you to call voting for a party ignorant or immoral , then i sincerely hope you did n't vote democrat . i do n't think it 's immoral and/or ignorant to vote for democrats . those people consider abortion the death of child that did nothing to deserve that fate and never had a fighting chance to control their fate . ( aside : i personally have not formed an opinion but am just saying that this is their stance ) people who die of climate change at least had a fighting chance . i drove my huge v6 car for a 10 minute drive and i actively added to climate change and so i deserve my fate . i did not recycle which resulted in climate change and so i deserve my fate . directly to your view : this is not immoral ( they honestly believe its the right thing to do ) nor is it ignorant ( they take in all the factors into consideration than just two numbers ."
9q3z2g,"the japanese model of extremely low immigration , low natality rates , and huge burden on the working population is the best way forward for the developed world . a core reason immigration is high in many developed countries is to provide enough working-age individuals to continue to produce enough wealth to fund the increasing pension and healthcare costs of the growing elderly . this method eases the burden on the young working class , while ensuring the state is able to provide for the elderly . the consequence is a changing landscape population-wide . countries like the uk , germany or france integrate this change , and attempt to adapt the national identity to reflect it , an identity based not on ethnic origins but on a common national identity , in the same way the us has upon its creation . there are two main drawbacks to this approach : 1 . cultural clashes . immigration is fodder for the alt right and has had a major impact on decisions like brexit and trump . long-term , these clashes might settle ( after all , italians or the irish used to be considered second citizens in the us , no longer ) , but they might not . 2 . economic implications . this one is more important : we ca n't keep having more people . populations need to shrink for the environment to stand even a little bit of a chance . the elderly population will keep going higher and higher , and the problem will not be resolved , it just will have more people involved . the japanese approach is this : no immigration , and instead the elderly work into their retirement , the young work ungodly hours , and take care of their parents ( and often grandparents as well ) . foreign workers are flown in for a couple of years then sent home . meanwhile , the population goes down by hundreds of thousands a year , while the gdp remains stable . every year , japan 's environmental footprint will go lower and lower . this approach also has drawbacks . 1 . cultural isolation . japan is very racist by western standards , and homogeneous . nationalism sentiment is high , and some are worried that if it was n't for the demilitarisation brought about after ww2 , japan might have imperialist aspirations . 2 . economic implications . the young work insanely high and have very little free time . the elderly often have to work into their retirement to make ends meet . foreign workers are treated pretty badly . both approaches have important drawbacks . however , while the first is more comfortable short-term , the second is the only one that may lead to a desperately-needed reduction in population , as well as fewer cultural clashes that feed populists .","there are many effective steps we can and are taking in western countries to try to reduce our carbon footprint . the consumption of meat on a massive scale , for example , is potentially the biggest factor in greenhouse gas emissions . if westerners cut their consumption of meat in half it would have a provably drastic effect on those emissions . how did you come to this conclusion that the only way for human beings to effectively reduce pollution is to stop immigration ? do you have data correlating this specifically to population shrinkage ? this is important because the japanese government and private industry have taken a number of steps , much like the rest of the developed world , to reduce their carbon emissions such as investing in nuclear energy and renewables . i 'd much sooner attribute lower emissions to things like that than the steady population decline . the reason people immigrate is to seek better job and/or life prospects , religious and societal tensions , changes in governments . the economic reason for immigration of the lead economical experts is that free flow of labor , keeps the economy revitalized and future proofed . government gets citizens of working age paying taxes , without the need for paying their schooling and "" growing up health and social benefits "" , etc. . immigration is the cause for the alt-right and ethnic nationalist propaganda that resulted in so much damage . then why does economic expert 's agree that free flow of labor is one of the most important think for flourishing economy to have ? as the economy of countries grows , and then stabilizes , the reproduction rates drop drastically . source . from this data it 's clear that the most effective way to drastically reduce world 's population is to improve the economy of those countries . from the top of my head the rohingya genocide in myanmar , the genocides in sudan , the genocides in syria causing the refugee crisis in europe , christians and muslim 's unrest in central african republic . and none of these happened because of immigrants / refugee 's invading and changing the country demographic . all of these happened because of the native-born population having different religion , combined with the recent shift in the countrie 's leadership ( aka christianity / islam being banned , or established as official religion or persecuted ) . i dont think you understand how catastrophic it would be for there to be less population growth in developed countries that desperately need it . the problem inherently feeds itself , creating a negative feedback loop . were talking about the worst depression the world has ever seen , because we simply dont have enough people to work the factors of production . furthermore , if that were n't the case , population growth isnt actually the problem you make it out to be . innovation in agriculture has always advanced to exceed population growth , and even now , we have the means to support billions and billions more people with our current agricultural technology . both of which would push our agricultural production even higher at no cost to the environment ( in fact , likely at benefit ) . show me an academic study that agrees with you about the perils of population growth , and we can talk . well , unless you are happy with working literally 70 plus hours a week , then i 'm not sure how the second solution would work at all . the basic fact remains that if the people are not satisfied or convinced that this is the "" right way "" to do things , then they would seek to change it . japan misses out on some basic human needs when they focus on just work . if you want a worker who can work 70 to 100 hours week , invest in robotics . if the majority of people are elderly and the youth are having less sex who 's going to fill the positions ? not only that but eventually the low immigration rate and birthrate will begin to affect the japanese economy negatively . the problems with the american model is n't the immigration , birthrate or burden on the working population but government policies that do n't prioritize ecological foresight or foresight of any sort . working until you die does n't sound very developed regardless . a population of 10 billion that uses renewable clean energy is better for the environment than a population of 1 billion that pumps smog into the air all day . japan still has very wealthy people and income inequality that causes massive issues . young people are n't forced to work ungodly hours specifically because of a lack of immigration but because of out-dated ideas about how long humans are effective at work and because they 're struggling to make enough money - money other institutions have . it 's not just wealthy individuals but massive companies that generate huge profits while not really helping out . i agree that japan serves as a model or counterpoint to people who insist that immigration is necessary to prop our civilization up , but it 's not the sole reason things are the way they are . the us could stand to cut back on immigration severely , as could any other country , but this would have to happen in tandem with a huge shift in lifestyle . like paying people wages you might not have expected before once we stop relying on foreign workers who accept smaller wages . while japan is known for its long work hours this is actualy False for the last decade or so . now japan is at place 22 at the oecd countries that work the most . the us holds place 16 ( they work more hours a year japan on average so to say ) and so does ireland and greece . overwork is no longer a large problem in japanese society . depending on if the immigrants are a net economic surplus or loss immigration is either worsening or improving the problems posed to the welfare state . for the gdp per capita to increase the average immigrant would need to earn more than the average native . this is what causes the next problem net tax wich is what affects if immigration is profitable for the welfare state . as op is talking about immigration to the developed world i will only consider immigration from the developing world . the average education level in the developing world is much lower and as a result the net tax effect is actualy negative currently and will continue to be so unless a policy of only accepting the higly educated is formed . japans system is not worse for preserving the welfare state , it is better . their economic situation stems from them being further down the road than any other developed country . japan has not proven they can manage an orderly decline in population while continuing to service their massive debts that will only grow per person as they decline . if that were to ( continue to ) wane , smaller countries would be at risk of increased costs of living , forced isolation or even takeover . japan faces precisely this danger if it ’s population continues to decline . the continue has no natural resources and little arable land , meaning it ’s very reliant on trade and the current world order to maintain its current standard of living . currently even the prime minister of japan is encouraging birth rates to rise . the combination of low birth rates with little to no immigration is a deadly one , because when the current working class retires , there will be too few citizens to support them and resistance against letting immigrants in to prop up the economy . work culture in japan is so problematic that people literally work themselves to death . sharing the burden among more people helps everyone lead more secure , fulfilling lives ."
9q3yfp,"the minimum wage should be directly attached to housing costs with low consideration of other factors . minimum wage is intended to be the lowest wage one can exist on without going into debt trying to buy groceries and toilet paper at the same time . the united states is way too big and way too varied in economic structure for a flat national minimum to make sense , so $ 15 nationally will not work . however , we ca n't trust the local corporate and legal structures to come up with wage laws that make sense for their area without some national guidelines . if you break down the cost of living , the biggest necessary expense for a single adult is going to be housing , usually by a very wide margin . landlords have a financial incentive to make this cost go up as much and as often as possible ( duh ) and no incentive to make housing affordable and accessible , because it 's a necessity that 's extremely hard to go without . you \ need \ housing in order to not die of exposure . this makes it easy for landlords and property managers to behave in predatory ways toward their tenants , for example raising the cost of housing on lease renewal by exactly the margin that the company their tenant works for has increased their pay . the landlord , doing no additional labor , is now getting that worker 's raise . it 's commonly agreed that 40 hours is a standard work week . using that number as our base , but acknowledging that most companies paying minimum wage are not interested in giving their workers the opportunity to approach overtime , i think it 's reasonable to say that the average part time worker can be expected to get around 20 hours . i believe that the minimum wage should be equivalent to the after tax , take-home pay that is needed to pay rent for safe single-person suitable housing within reasonable transit distance from the job , and that this amount of money should be earned in under 60 hours per month ( 15/week ) . this ensures that : 1 . local business will pressure landlords to keep housing near their businesses affordable , so 2 . the cost of housing will trend toward slightly above the cost of maintaining that housing , which deincentivizes profiting off of owning something you are n't using , making the cost of purchasing a home and settling in early adulthood well within the realm of possibility for your average family 3 . the minimum wage is scaled according to the most expensive regional thing you have to pay for , and 4 . anyone who holds any job will be able to afford safe shelter for at least long enough to find a better job or get some education , which will increase stability and reduce the homeless population using the market instead of using public services as band aids i do acknowledge that there are some issues inherent in this , for example walmart purchasing a building and turning it into $ 12.50 / month studio apartments in order to retain a low labor value in the area or the implications in how this impacts military pay , but the idea here is to specifically plan for regional nuance , so doing this would also involve preventing large corporate entities from buying apartment buildings . i 've believed this for a long while but i also do not feel that i know enough about politics or economics to have a reliable understanding of many facets of the situation , and i look forward to discussing it so i can adjust this view accordingly if you start a conversation i 've had 12 times already i 'm just ignoring the message , sorry . and someone asked for specific examples of what rent prices would result in what wages , so if a standard , expected price for a two bedroom apartment is $ 1200 , pay should be around $ 10 ( net pay , so probably closer to $ 12 gross ) because accommodation for one person costs $ 600 a month , which can be earned in 60 hours at that rate . also , i 'm going to bed soon , have work in the morning . & #x200b ;","when i was a landlord , we based our rent on the minimum we could charge and still be able to pay bills , pay taxes , and make repairs . those who could n’t afford it were able to get housing assistance and we often had tenants who utilized this , or social security benefits . we eventually had to sell our building because property taxes continued to increase while wages did not . the water bill went up , too , and this was because the locals voted against paying more in taxes to improve the city ’s water supply system . there are definitely slumlords out there , but keep in mind that cost of living is incredibly complicated , and ultimately it is local property taxes and utility rates that control housing expenses . that system does n't really work , i live with my parents and work so should i get the same as everyone else when i do n't really need it ? there ’s less desirable housing than people who want to live in attractive cities . increasing minimum wage in this manner will just cause rents to increase by similar amounts , making everyone except landlords worse off . it is built on the minimum amount of work you need to do to keep the job profitable . for example , a shop clerk who simple scans purchases and conducts transactions should be paid the bare minimum allotted by law . the job takes no real skill except being able to read and count change , which you should know by the time you hit middle school at the very least . however an engineer should be paid much more due to the skill and education required for their role . if you go and learn a trade , you should be paid more and in turn be able to afford a more expensive place . if you do enough to scrape by then you get the place affordable to you , even if it means 3 roommates in a tiny place . i blame truman , after the war , wages fell be nearly 40 percent because the war effort was over and it was deemed that things would be cheaper again . while the sudden increase of a minimum wage to $ 15/hr may have some effects on commodity prices and employment , it would only be short term , as people earn more money , they also spend more , so in the end it causes an equilibrium . australia has a minimum wage of $ 18.29 / hr , and places like mcdonalds have no higher prices than the us . i dont think minimum wage could ever be tied to housing prices , because what happens if there is suddenly a housing bubble crash ? as for the empty houses issue that causes a ridiculous rise in rent prices because of an artificial housing shortage , wouldnt the better solution be to not allow foreign investors to buy housing , or have a condition that they must rent out the housing or live in it for x number of months a year ? any more than that number and they either have to sell some of their empty houses or rent them out . however , if you are willing to consider that minimum wage jobs are not intended for people who are supporting themselves , then we might be able to find some common ground . personally , i think it boils down to a education/skill gap issue at its core . if public education and government support resources were better , we would n’t see people trying to support themselves or their families with minimum wage jobs . instead , those low-skill , low-stakes jobs would be filled by the kind of workers i personally believe they really are intended for : students looking for some extra cash , retirees looking for something to get them out of the house on a regular basis , and secondary household wage earners looking for some supplemental income . you ’d think they would want minimum wage to go up so they can get a slice of that pie i feel like that would just encourage higher housing costs and lead to less people being employed , unless , perhaps , the employer makes money off of high housing costs . there is zero logic behind basing housing costs on living alone . minimum wage gets raised to match housing costs which incentivizes people to move to the area for the higher pay . this drives up housing costs due to the higher demand . minimum wage laws are a partial attempt to lessen the material difference between workers and capitalists . they 're sold by centre and right-wing political groups , usually by appeal to an electorate . they 're classic technocracy - an appeal to "" what works "" - in this case , the paid worker . the political aim of the minimum wage is to justify the system by tweaking a mechanism . minimum wage laws are not revolutionary ; they 're the result of bargaining . functionally they depend on a belief that the mimimum wage is the price to pay off the left . when the left is unorganized , yet amenable to transactions , you get minimum wage legislation . unions , by definition , push for better wages and living conditions for their members . recent attempts to push for a "" living wage "" reflect the continuing weakness of ( american ) unions . effectively the price to pay off the left has risen . unfortunately for the right , the failure of many developed nations to recover from 2008 has called into question the neoliberal ideology . this makes defenders of the current system propose ever more contorted ways to justify it . because the left is increasingly organising to fight for it 's own ; while the right increasingly defines "" decent people "" and defends their benefits ( pensions ) . where i live people realized it ’s not worth their time to rent traditionally . i worked hard to do something that is n’t bare minimum . if i saved and invested in a home ( $ 500k for something half decent where i live ) to be told it has to be affordable for someone making $ 8-12 an hour it ’s not worth it . there ’s no middle class anymore because people choose not to work for it and instead want $ 15 an hour and subsidized housing the reason we have the minimum wage is because it protected white workers from being outpriced by immigrants . it was sold as a protection of workers rights , but if you dig a bit deeper , it 's intended effect was to prevent able bodied people from working for what they are worth , and that is exactly what it does . your plan wo n't work because all it would do is force low-skilled workers into poverty . the minimum wages is ultimately paid for by consumers in the form of higher prices , meaning it increases the cost of living . housing prices tend to fluctuate with the market , but wages do n't . it would rise exponentially until this is a ginormous gap until everyone is earning minimum wage except a few billionaires . if you 're selling a thing , and ca n't keep it in stock , then you raise the price . so , you 're renting apartments , minimum wage goes up , and suddenly you 're unable to keep any in stock . now you 're the bad guy , but all you 're doing is correctly pricing your goods . this is not to mention that minimum wage laws act to oppress the poor . perhaps you 're worth 12 dollars an hour , but minimum wage is 15 . now you 're unemployable . if they could pay you 12 , you would be able to have a job , and as you get better , you could increase your value . the premise that local business will pressure landlords is a leaping assumption . the businesses do not have that influential power over another a wide range of individual rentals that compete with each other . an individual making minimum wage should expect not to be able to afford a place by themselves . it is literally the minimum "" work "" effort someone is contributing . housing in australia has in the past 12 months dropped roughly 20 % . it seems to me like americans live on the brink of ruin . the minimum wage could be a million dollars and the cost of everything you need to live would still take that from you leaving you no better off than a fifteen dollar minimum wage . i think what is needed is a much bigger change than minimum wage laws . minimum wage is simply the lowest someone is allowed to pay an employee . when a company sells you a product , you want it as low as possible . you do n't care about whether the company can survive when selling at that price . the government fixing it 's price in order to keep the price high enough will not save a failing company . if their product is worth $ 50 to you , the government fixing the price of that product at $ 60 means you simply wo n't buy it . a company only values your hours at a certain price . the government mandating them pay more is gon na make them lay off people . “ minimum wage is intended to be the lowest wage one can exist on without going into debt trying to buy groceries and toilet paper at the same time . ” minimum wage should be the lowest minimum wage reasonable for a 16-year-old working their first job while living with their parents . i also think other welfare programs , like snap for example , should be revised to become more efficient in boosting effective income before we raise the minimum wage . the reason for this is to allow young teens to gain job experience and thicken their resume before they have to rely on their job as their primary source of income . if we were to increase the minimum wage , the job market would shrink to some extent and favor older applicants who have more work experience , leading to less experienced and harder-to-hire youth . why ca n't it be the minimum someone who has n't had a chance to make something of his life to earn while living with their parents ? this whole living alone thing is pretty new too , why should n't minimum wage cover a room instead of an apartment ? most people have roommmates even if they earn enough they can make ends meet without others , cause who wants to afford a lonely one bedroom apartment ? there 's no evidence or reason to believe landlords are raising prices based on how much their tenants make . right 40 hours , if you are making minimum wage its a given you have to work overtime to have nice things . if we start letting the minimum wage workers make enough they can afford luxuries , then they wo n't go to college or trade school and society will be the one to suffer . housing costs have always related to how much people in the city make . if minimum wage goes , more people will want to move out on their own , less houses available , houses start costing more . that would be a benefit , but less people would go to college and contribute something real to society . lastly , money does n't come out of thin air , if the minimum wage worker is benefitting , everyone else loses . in this case a lot , prices will go up to compensate the employees now making double . this will once again discourage people from going to college , if people can make the same amount with or without a degree , they 're going to choose no degree more of the time . i am concerned that corporate america could easily exploit loopholes in this system to underpay their workers . wal-mart could exploit some obscure rule to define the average housing cost as far lower than the real cost , and thus underpay their workers . since the calculation of minimum wage like this would most likely take place at the local level , companies could easily pressure local governments to overlook shady practices . however , i do agree that setting the minimum wage at a level as high as the federal would fail to account for regional diversity . you 've given me something new to think about though . the idea of landlords ( like myself ) being pressured by local businesses is laughable . in which case if the prescribed rent was less than i could get elsewhere or was n’t enough to make the mortgage payments cash flow positive i would sell . the greatest argument for an increase in minimum wage is that the earners generally put every dollar back into the economy - it ’s money well spent for everyone . a lot of small businesses will feel immediate growing pains but literally everyone will end up benefiting from a higher minimum wage up to an almost absurd level ( like $ 25/hr ) when you have a good or service that is relatively finite in nature , the price of that good or service is dictated by the number of goods being sold and the number of buyers buying - we call this supply and demand . if supply drops relative to the number of buyers , the price increases . if supply increases relative to the number of buyers , the price decreases . raising the minimum wage increases the number of buyers , but does nothing for the supply . i think you might retort that supply more than covers the number of buyers , given the number of vacant homes in the us , but this logic is a bit flawed , since people live in cities , not countries . what this basically means is that those vacant homes are not in direct competition , are not a part of the under supplied markets . the existence of vacant homes in oklahoma is not going to drive down housing prices in nyc or vancouver . i might need a person to stock shelves , or to clean the equipment , or to answer the phones . i hire them because each of them perform a function that will increase my profits above what it costs to employ them . if i pay them $ 18,000 a year , and their activity gains me $ 20,000 a year then it is worthwhile for me to employ them . check out thomas sowell 's "" basic economics "" ( great audiobook version ) for a detailed analysis of minimum wage and rent control . when you add a tariff one of the things that happens is domestic producers of products being taxed raise their prices . your premise is just plain wrong - minimum wage is not the same thing as “ support me and my family wage ” . minimum wage jobs are for low/no skill , and are not ( and should not ) be intended to be the kind of thing you can live on ! get an education , work hard , and get a real job to live on ! sounds good on paper , will just cost some people there jobs so the few left can get the pay rise . minimum wage i agree is off at best , but it is not designed to live off of . it is designed for a single person to own a studio , basic utilities , and basic meals . what people are missing a lot of the times is minimum wage is minimum skill ( if any at all ) the reason why landlords have higher pricing is because people move . if we were all assigned to a room and not allowed to leave i can understand making places to live cheaper , but facts are that sometimes landlords have vacant units . those units are bleeding the landlord dry as they still have to pay the mortgage loan they took out to own that property . chances are someone living on their own is going to work at least 30 hours . with a 30 hour work week at 15/hr after taxes you will have about $ 1,560 ( 20 % tax rate to be safe which is ridiculous ) a standard studio is about 800 , utilities average 250 , 150 car payment ( assuming higher for interest and a ok car since some new cars are cheap now ) gas at 100 ( less if you dont drive far or a good mpg car ) 60 for insurance . companies have to make money to pay employees their wages . because 15 is the base pay not the supervisor pay , the managers pay , corporate pay , or ceo pay . and it has to be equal pay no matter what because of equal wage laws . if joe dirt at 1 location does the same work as john doe at a different and they have same title , and experience then they have to make the same or else thw company can be sued . they people above the basic workers will want to step down to make a smig less an hour for less responsibility . along with that higher wage could ( key word ) raise prices to counteract higher wages . companies should be free to pay whatever wage they 'd they 'd like and we , as a workforce , should be free to take our labor to the highest bidder . if a company can hire two people instead of one , then we should n't force them by law to pay a minimum wage that would only allow them to hire one of those people . in big city ’s , with high paying jobs such as developer , it ’s a really tough economical balance . lots of tech jobs , big money startups . because of this , rent is scaled up in the area ( and even surrounding areas ) . if the minimum wage was raised to a standard you ’d expect , all independent businesses ( like the locally famous hrd ) would go out of business . and even larger , more corporate restaurants would choose to remove locations , as the cost over takes the profit , and the business would fall out of the black . basically , this would unintentionally support a hyper capitalistic system , and remove small business even further than its being removed now . for one , if there is a significant increase in minimum wages in an area , there wo n't be any small businesses able to compete with large companies in the first place . landlords are going to charge the market price no matter what . if investors do n't expect to get much rent money , and especially if it does n't exceed their mortgage , you will see an ever dwindling number of houses being maintained . so to recap i think your plan will kill small businesses who ca n't afford to pay market wages well above the value of the actual employees . housing will be in a shortage as land lords would get out of business having less ability to calculate how much rent they will be able to get . this shortage will ensure the few houses left will have high prices ( supply and demand ) . this will then turn around and forcefully raise wages in the area , decreasing employment . wow , such ignorant , entitled , privileged view to think someone should make a living working 60 hours a week . 100 + hr a week ) to make a living , if you are worthless in the market to earn minimum wage . for example , there 's a maximum amount a lease can be increased at renewal ( i do n't remember the exact details , buti think it 's around 3 % , essentially following inflation ) . the landlords can increase the rent in-between tenants but must provide the amount of rent that was paid in the previous 12 months . as long as the tenant follows the terms of the lease , they can not be evicted unless the owner wishes to enlarge , divide or demolish the unit ( and the landlords also have to pay 3 month 's worth of rent to the tenant , plus moving expenses ) . the landlord can also repossess if they want to live in the unit , but only if he does not own a similar vacant unit ( similar meaning of the relatively same size location and rent ) . anything done in bad faith ( fake repossessions ) by the landlord is punishable by the régie du logement ( government body that manages housing ) . it 's not a perfect system but a lot of the problems and landlord abuse you mention ( not all , crazy unaffordable san francisco rent would stay crazy and unaffordable ) would be solved without tying up rent prices to minimum wages . if you 're working $ 10/hr in a high col area ... move out or get a better job . just because you want to live in a big city does n't mean the employers should pay you more , it means you should move somewhere else so you can afford to live comfortably . not everyone can live in a city the same way not everyone can drive a masarati . minimum wage should be directly proportional to the highest pay d member of a society . makes sense but in san francisco as a business owner how are you gon na stay in business selling a $ 10 to $ 20 burger paying your cooks $ 50 an hour ? personally i would argue that we have subsidies for people who can not find a way to make their employment and housing situation work . it ’s not on the onus of the employer to do anything more than compensate employees for their worth based on value to that company . an even bigger company in a foreign country that owns multiple companies that each own 100,000 + homes across the world . with each middle man there is more demand for the price to go up and a bigger disconnect from the location and it 's struggles . i think a good example of this is how for the past few years people in china have been investing money by buying homes in big international cities . they buy the homes , keep the price high , set high rent , and do n't care if nobody can afford to rent it because it is just an investment for them . set reasonable tax rates that will always be enforced no matter what ( this would really screw over evangelical mega churches and corrupt places like goodwill , amazon , etc ) . make a national law in regards to what a landlord has to do ( maintenance , etc ) . make a maximum and minimum pricing scheme based on home evaluation , location , wealth of the area , local economy , etc . it 's no one 's responsibility to make sure other people can afford a house or anything else for that matter . i think it 's crazy that the huge corporations have n't implemented affordable apartments for their employees . if we ca n't trust the local legal structure , what give you any reason to believe we can trust the federal legal structure , which is even more disinterested and less accountable ? where i live housing prices and rent are so insane the minimum wage would have to be $ 20 an hour . $ 40 an hour if you actually expected to buy a house . i know people working in health care that are only making $ 20 an hour , why would you get an education and go into health care if you could just make the same doing a job a highschool drop out can get ? if a person wants to work for a certain amount of money and a business is willing to pay them that amount then who are you to say that they are n't allowed to say that that mutually agreed upon transaction should not be allowed ? circular argument , you are effectively forcing business who do n’t care for each other to work together because the minimum wage demands it , even though it ultimately harms one or the other . imagine applying this to a place like new york city , any janitorial position is guaranteed a six figure salary , and as a result , there will no longer be any janitors , as it becomes cheaper to buy robots than hire people . to drive down housing prices for the current demans , you must build more housing to increase the supply . if you arbitrarily raise the wage ... more people will be able to afford ( increasing demand ... increasing housing prices . can you cite a reference for your definition of minimum wage . minimum wage was never intended to be a living wage to support a family . it is an entry level wage for new members of the work force , college students that work part time , seniors on social security and so on . a minimum wage employee making $ 7.25 per hour , costs the business closer to $ 20.00 per hour , with mandatory health care , employment taxes and other employer matched taxes . forcing employers to pay a higher minimum wage will simply mean that employers will hire less employees and pay the ones they do hire less . other jobs will simply be come contractor positions where the contractor is paid very little and is expected to cover self employment and income taxes . end result , less employees , lower wages for all and a dramatic reduction in tax revenue . end result , virtually no minimum wage earners in seatac . those workers come from , and are paid by companies in the surrounding communities . there are undoubtedly many places where housing costs are relatively cheap but things like food and utilities are through the roof . a novel concept : wage should be tied to value added through an action or series of actions in agreement between two or more persons . make the minimum wage 100 dollars an hour and then see what kind of housing you can afford cooking french fries . it 's all relative , the minimum wage number means nothing because the jobs you do to earn it are worth nothing . this is suuuper petty but am i the only one who wants to know what op makes and what city they live in ? one thing that a lot of people against raising the minimum wage do n’t seem to realize is the fact that a lot of those increased wages will go straight back in to the economy , providing a stimulus of sorts . abolish minimum wage , remove all rent controls , incentivize investment in rural areas via tax breaks , replace welfare with ubi . the effects of minimum wage and rent control are very clear . as soon as you deinsetivize ownership ( stocks , real estate , business ) it turns the area into an economic nightmare . the minimum wage has good intentions but does n't deliver on its promises . the young poor kid is priced right out of the market because government says businesses need to pay "" a living wage "" . entry level jobs are not intended to provide a living wage , but a stepping stone . housing prices are fairly variable even within cities and you would probably end up calculating multiple minimum wages for individual cities . this would make a complicated system for both employees and employers . also housing is not the only good that costs more in an urban environment . a minimum wage should account for a general cost of living for an area . so i agree housing is definitely a consideration , you can only set so many wages as a policy maker . in the u.s we already have set higher minimum wages in states with higher costs of living in most cases . i think a helpful start should be setting a city versus rural wage to adjust for the cost of living . itt people do not know why minimum wage was created in the first place . that experience requirement is intended to ensure that the applicants are worth the pay that comes with the job . and you make the case for adults , people making their own way ... but what about those who are not in the "" adult "" stage of life ? who 's going to hire a 16 y/o , and pay them a wage that was set assuming the appropriate experience and competence of someone with 50-100 % more experience than them ? the housing costs will adjust to what the market will bear . i 'm all for minimum wage but i 've always felt that minimum wage and certain entry level jobs like macdonalds ( i 've worked there ) were for young adults living at home with their parents and that money was just for luxury items or whatever . once you 've worked at macdonalds for a little while , maybe get a supervisor position , you put it on your resume and then get a higher paying position somewhere else . for myself i worked at macdonalds , then i moved to a grocery store and worked my way up to manager . once i was a manager and on "" okay "" money i moved out of my parents place . i 've never considered "" minimum wage "" to equal "" livable single person wage "" housing prices go up because of supply vs. demand — too much demand given the housing supply . if you increase minimum wage to fit housing prices , it would attract more workers and drive up housing prices even more , which then would increase minimum wage more , which would in turn increase housing demand , etc. etc. in an infinite loop . instead , i think a much simpler and more appropriate solution is to give everyone cash . universal basic income . this gives people the freedom to be able leave these economic traps and find a situation that makes more financial sense for them . instead of minimum wage ( which is a pre-market solution ) , we should just give people cash ( which is a post-market solution ) . i might be wrong , but if i remember correctly from my high school national history day project , an economist named benjamin graham tried to make this the idea behind the value of the dollar . it was called the the commodity standard , introduced 1940s ish , where the value of a dollar would be based on everyday household items back in the day ( things like a gallon of gas , gallon of milk , dozen eggs , etc . ) well the schools knew the money was a lock and all of a sudden tuition skyrocketed . now who students not only have to fight for jobs they are stuck with that loan debt that ca n't be bankruptcy . could we have done something better to ensure a proper education that left the student without a mountain of debt ? that ’s not even remotely close to being what minimum wage is . minimum wage is what you pay teenagers and low level entry jobs . silicon valley has successfully created an operating zone inside the united states were the value of the usd is drastically different from anywhere else inside the country . why should you pay workers some 15 dollars an hour if they live on the outer edge of these highly valued zones when there are workers that are willing to travel further to take the job ? if you paid people based on there circumstance , cities would be incentivized to make the cost of living sky high . that would force businesses to pay much higher minimum wage and then allow the government to tax the life out of that money before it landed back in the workers hands . pass flat tax laws , remove all subsidies for housing , drop minimum wage completely . if you are a renter and you want a tenant then you have to charge what they can afford . if people are not locked into received set amounts from government requirements then those landlords are also not going to be able to so easily put a bottom price on there units . employers also have to pay a living wage if they expect there employees to show up at work the next day . businesses can not operate if employees are unable to come to work because they ar n't fed or have decent housing . minimum wage should n't be tied to any outside factor . as you increase minimum wage , sellers of goods will simply increase the price of necessities to match the higher minimum wage and you are back at step one . the market will automatically fix problem by itself . imagine this , in a city like san jose , one of the most expensive place to pay for housing . any business operating here will have to pay their employees enough to at least rent a house . if they will not pay enough , they do n't have the ability to retain their employees , so they will have to relocate to a less expensive area . once enough business leaves an area , employees leave with them too and the demand for housing drops . but on the other hand , if the business is successful like the one in san jose , the housing price will stay up or even increase . in addition , if employees do n't have enough to pay for housing and they end up becoming homeless . as a result , housing price will drops , area becomes a ghetto and businesses leave the area . when enough people leave the area , new residents will come in for the low prices . but with the internet and more transparent salary / housing prices , this problem can go away . minimum wage is simply the lowest someone is allowed to pay an employee . when a company sells you a product , you want it as low as possible . you do n't care about whether the company can survive when selling at that price . the government fixing it 's price in order to keep the price high enough will not save a failing company . if their product is worth $ 50 to you , the government fixing the price of that product at $ 60 means you simply wo n't buy it . a company only values your hours at a certain price . the government mandating them pay more is gon na make them lay off people . let 's do a thought experiment with an area i live near by ( san francisco ) . probably any low margin business where you can order online goes under right away . restaurants have to be local , so they probably just raise their prices a lot . probably some may close since people eat out less , but there still should be a bunch available ( and keep in mind min wage workers have more income now ) . wage workers stop living with roommates since they can afford their own place ( leading to less housing available ) . people from all over the california move to san francisco since minimum wage is $ 30/hr . i think the root of the problem is if you have 5 people and there are 3 housing units , you ca n't make housing affordable to all 5 by paying them more . but your plan could maybe work , by forcing less profitable business to close and those workers to move away . cost of housing goes up , wages go up , cost of everything goes up , landlords raise prices to cover costs and you 've got yourself a feedback loop . salary is based on the value of one ’s labor , not the cost of real estate . however , let ’s ignore all the reasons your idea bad save for one : if you guarantee that minimum wage will cover the cost of housing , the cost of housing will continue to increase . or you wait until no one rents or buys because they are too expensive and have to move the price down . for example it may take you 2 hours to walk to work , but just 15 minutes to drive . if we 're basing this off of public transit , how will this work in smaller towns or cities where there is no/limited public transit available . depending on how "" reasonable "" is defined , you could end up having a minimum wage that varies between neighbourhoods the same municipality . what 's stopping someone from taking a job in an area with a high cost of living ( such as a downtown core or affluent neighbourhood ) while living an "" unreasonable "" distance away in a poor neighbourhood and pocketing the significant difference ? for example , in new york city , the average rent in tribeca is $ 4,000 per month while the average rent in morrisania is $ 1,200 per month . if we broke down the wage by neighborhood , according to your guidelines tribeca would have a rough minimum wage of $ 67 per hour while morrisania would have a rough minimum wage of $ 20 per hour . what exactly is stopping someone from taking a job in a place like tribeca , living an "" unreasonable "" distance away in a poorer community , and pocketing the significant difference in wages tied to rent costs ? similar to reasonable distance , i feel as though people could also take advantage of this . having two roommates living in a 2 bedroom apartment/basement/floor / etc will usually bring the per-person rent costs below the costs of renting an individual one bedroom , sometimes by a considerable amount . this , like a slightly longer commute , would yield considerable higher monthly take-home while only marginally reducing the quality of life of the renters ( if done correctly , that is ) . that 's not really how rent prices are determined , and there 's not much a local business can do to "" pressure "" a landlord into keeping prices down . with the exception of legislated rent control , rents are determined by the demand and supply of rental housing in a given market . what would occur in such a scenario is the movement of businesses from wealthier areas to poorer areas to take advantage of the lower wages . this could also lead to companies implementing corporate housing schemes in order to avoid higher wages in these wealthier areas . the cost of purchasing and leasing property will likely increase alongside such a significant increase . you would be increasing demand for property considerably ( by giving more consumers money ) while the supply would stay relatively constant in the short term ( houses are n't built overnight ) . in the long term , construction costs would likely be higher as well , meaning the cost of building housing would also increase . this would likely increase the homeless and unemployed population as businesses close which are no longer profitable at the current wage levels . small , sensible increases generally do not have a major effect on the economy , but you are proposing a major national change that could see wages in certain areas quadruple overnight . for example , a business with 5 full time employees earning $ 10 per hour currently would cost that business around $ 104,000 per year in direct wage costs . however , if the minimum wage in this area was increased to $ 20/hr ( average one bedroom apartment $ 1,200 ) , this would increase the wage costs of that business to $ 208,000 . another issue facing businesses would be the increased competition between different communities/neighbourhoods . because of the extreme discrepancy in wages in some areas , how could a business based in tribeca possibly compete with one offering the same goods/services in morrisania , for example ? finally , and perhaps the most notable reason as to why this is not a reasonable proposal : if landlords are currently willing to increase rates based on increased rates at work , why would n't they be willing to increase their rates once your rates go up significantly ? the other interesting issue is that you seem to be going after business owners in an effort to prevent predatory landlords , which does n't really make sense to me . if you 're in favour of widespread legislation such as this , surely something like rent control ( which directly deals with landlords ) would be preferable . while rent control is not without its drawbacks , it does seem to be a much better solution to this issue than major changes to the minimum wage . do you think that this would make people who are n't that smart move to the places with high minimums and drain the low wage areas ? so if we take san francisco as an example : the average rent for a 1 bedroom apartment is $ 3334 . if you want to make minimum wage regional , what is to stop people from working and living in separate areas in order to reap the benefits of a wage that is higher than their reflective housing cost ? it would be quite easy to work in a region with a minimum wage that is relatively high compared to the housing cost of the region that they live in . inversely , due to the created imbalance of available jobs with wages that reflect housing costs , people would be forced to find jobs in regions with minimum wages that negatively reflect their housing costs , therefore still unable to afford their housing . the only solution i can think of for that problem would be for employers to individually assess their employees housing costs and administer minimum wage based upon that , which would in return make employers seek out people living in cheap housing and consequently pay them a low minimum wage . not sure if i 'm missing something here , but that was my first thought as to the primary way in which this system could collapse . my personal input is that a solution would be in the form of increased competition in the housing industry . when the government supplies people with housing , it deters the privatized construction of housing due to the fact that there is no profit to be made by making housing that is cheaper than governmental housing which is not intended to make a profit in the first place . if the government already has housing that does not turn a profit , then the only way to compete would be to create housing that returns a negative profit . without governmental housing and regulation , private housing businesses would be forced to compete in providing the best quality housing for the cheapest price . consumers would clearly choose the housing that is of the highest quality in their budget , therefore reducing the cost of housing without diminishing quality . i think housing is no different than any other product , obviously you need it to survive , but the supply and demand concept remains the same . at the end of the day , consumers are going to purchase the product that is of the highest quality at the cheapest price . cars are generally considered a necessity to the average citizen in the u.s. , and by creating competition , tesla is able to continually produce electric vehicles cheaper than ever . i can only imagine this will force other manufacturers to follow suit in creating quality affordable transportation in order to gain business from tesla . you said that landlords have only the incentive to increase housing cost and no incentive to decrease it . if you take this to the fictional extreme , then every landlord would make their rent one million dollars per month ; at that point , anybody with a somewhat business minded brain would make housing one thousand dollars a month and take the business from of all of the competition . this cycle would repeat until eventually we come to affordable , quality housing . i think that if you are going to base a minimum wage entirely off of the single aspect of housing , then perhaps a better angle would be to restructure housing instead of putting a minimum wage "" bandaid "" on it which simultaneously affects every other aspect of people 's lives . instead of roundaboutly forcing employers to pay employees a wage for housing , why not incentivize businesses to compete in the housing industry , therefore making it affordable for the current minimum wage ? historically , wage and cost of living have always been related . but the minimum wage is not and should not be enough to live independently . it is meant for entry level positions so that young people can acquire skills . my solution was to start working part time at 15 . at 20 i had a salaried job with benefits with no degree . employers compete for skilled workers and in turn pay is typically higher then minimum in most high rent cities . sure it sucks to make minimum wage but irrationally imposed minimums lead to increases that are passed directly to the same people renting - consumers . also i am in la where we are going to $ 15 and we have seen a huge push towards kiosks to cut what would be minimum wage staff . the minimum wage generally hurts the poor , and should be abolished completely . moreover , most people on minimum wage are on it for a relatively short amount of time . a huge portion are young people who are n't looking or generally in the position to be completely self sufficient . you also forgot these low skilled jobs are going in favor of being replaced by robots in the coming years as minimum wage goes up the cost of a robot is comparable . i am curious what this would make the minimum wage . honestly , i think the simplest answer to this problem is passing legislation that kind of regulates the cost of living across different states . this would make things like minimum wages and any statistics in general to be so much easier on everyone . say they are closed with a paper sign over the drive thru from the standpoint of someone who used to like the minimum wage concept , but then grew to dislike it as i gained more experience as a blue collar worker and investor , i have the following critiques : wages are already the primary driving force for housing costs . real estate is one of the longest term investments around with the property taking potentially decades to turn a net profit from its initial construction . therefore , as a property owner , it 's in your best interest to charge as much as is feasible for your product so you can turn a profit . and do n't forget , most rental properties are mortgaged just like regular homes , a big chunk of your rent ultimately lands in the bank 's coffers , not your landlord 's . this is actually closer to the the current model for a lot more housing than you may realize . most lenders require that rental properties are insured prior to renting it out . this means that for the majority of properties , especially for new construction , they have to pay not only the mortgage payment , but also insurance and maintenance costs . the average single family rental property is lucky to make $ 400 profit in a given month , reduced even further when a property manager has to get involved to manage the 20 + property portfolio required to make a living solely off rentals . in other words , even on the high end of profitability , they 're actually only making about as much as an engineer in terms of the amount of work required to manage the property in a given month . the minimum wage is scaled off of outrage more than anything an economist has ever said . it 's a direct driver of inflation and is , at its core , a band-aid solution to a much more complex issue . the cycle of the minimum wage tends to go like this : businesses raise all wages up to some variable cutoff point to keep the near minimum wage earners from having their own fit due to the devaluing of their work businesses see their new bottom line and start making cuts in employee hours or layoffs to make up for inflated labor costs ( most businesses operate on small profit margins ) employees that get hours cut go home with the same or less than they were making previously while layoffs have trouble finding any employment as every other employer has taken these steps depending on how much the wage has risen , people either survive the joblessness through unemployment benefits or go homeless ( see s.f. ) eventually , due to increased wages , inflation starts to rise as the lowest rung of the productive economic ladder is making more housing rises with inflation as the True value of the land owners profits diminish business is making more money due to the increased revenue brought on by inflation employees realize that everything is more expensive than it used to be . essentially , from an economic standpoint , a minimum wage earner is of a certain value to the wider public . changing the currency does n't change the value of the work it represents , therefore , everything else will adjust proportionally given time as nothing has changed in terms of the value of the work to society . the reality of the situation is that any increase to the minimum wage causes harm to some ( via reduced hours or layoffs ) for the benefit of others ( the lucky ones that dodge the layoffs and cuts ) . california took this to the extreme with its minimum wage hikes driving people to record levels of homelessness . if you want to affect real change , then you need to either make minimum wage earners more valuable to society or make them worth paying more than minimum wage . we dont have minimum wage at all here in finland .... i live in a rural area and housing is cheap , if you choose to make the commitment and buy . for reasons that are n't clear to me , many people do n't want to buy , they want to rent . someone could have bought the 3br 2ba house down the road from me for $ 40k , but nobody did and now it rents for $ 1,200 per month . renters are always going to pay a significant premium for the luxury of not committing . transportation and healthcare each cost more than housing ( for the homeowner ) . as far as minimum wage goes , we use $ 15/hr as the minimum , but folks that are paid $ 15/hr are expected to generate at least $ 120,000 annually for the company . it is to pay young people and students some walking around money in their first job while they learn responsibility and structure . ffs people it 's not a minimum wage allowance , it 's a minimum land allowance that is needed . big companies welcome a raise in min wage bc it 's gets rid of mom and pop shops to compete with . they ca n't afford to pay their workers so high . yes min wage should not be what you live and raise a family on but min wage jobs are easy to move up , with that comes raises . mcdonald 's should n't pay a cashier that much but if you do a good job you can easily move into management and make a livable wage . youre paid your worth and min wage workers are easily replaceable if you want to live in bell air it does n't seem reasonable to pay me an exorbitant amount working at mcdonalds so i can live in a mansion . in fact , i 'd imagine with this structure , min wage job offerings would cease to exist all together . then you 'd get in to this whole gentrification of labor thing - prevent low income people from moving in to areas by forcing job availability let 's say you 're renting out one - , two - , and three-bedroom apartments in an area where gross minimum wage is required to be at least three times the average rent of a one bedroom apartment . minimum wage is currently $ 8 per hour , and you 're charging $ 500/mo for a one-bedroom , $ 700 for a two-bedroom , and $ 900 for a three-bedroom . the average price for a one-bedroom in your area is $ 600 , so minimum wage goes up to $ 11.25 , and suddenly people can afford a lot more for housing . there is no right that exists , or that should exist , that says somebody can live in whatever city they want and be able to live without roommates in an average house while working an entry level job . if a person chooses to go to a community college to learn a trade that produces a livable wage , they will receive financial aid to help with housing . if they choose not to make themselves more marketable and want to live on an entry level wage , they should move to somewhere that is affordable to them . i used to think like this ; however , now i live on the border between two states with very different social programs , and i can see how there needs to be some sort of federal standard to keep states from just creating disparities . my husband runs a business in the lower minimum wage state and it is nearly impossible for him to keep employees . people will get hired , but as soon as there is another entry-level job a available across the border , those people drop the lower-paying job and drive five extra minutes to work . also , the low-paying state has high property taxes , so there are significantly more foreclosures and empty homes due to the fact that people will just move across the state line as soon as a less-expensive ( tax-wise ) house is available . also , welfare in the higher-paying state is better , so people who require government assistance will move states , thus increasing the burden on that state ’s social programs . having a federal standard for minimum wage and a lot of other things stops this siphoning of citizens , and allows people to find a place to live that suits other needs , like local activities or school systems , rather than just wherever they can afford to live . while this sort of minimum wage increase has negative consequences for employment numbers and commodity pricing which can have knockon effects to housing , that is n't really what you argument is about , so i am not going to address it further . if everything your argument was premised upon worked , the real issue would be the provision of housing . people/corporations build housing , or purchase and rent housing , to turn a profit . only governments build housing ' altruistically ' and it almost universally ends up as a slightly better or slightly worse ghetto . the pressures to keep housing costs down actively dissuade the construction of further housing , making the cost of purchasing or renting accommodation extremely difficult due to supply : demand issues - see : london , new york , vancouver , or any similar large city with substantial social housing provision - all have catastrophic supply/demand problems . you attempt to address this by tying the wage to the housing price , but this simply results in a runaway minimum wage increase trying to keep up , which results either in untenable inflation or the utter death of industry as employers move somewhere where they can actually afford the workers . this problem is fundamentally caused by low-skilled jobs being available in abundance in cities , where housing demand exceeds supply causing high costs . housing affordable on minimum wage exists , just not in big cities . trying to ' force ' minimum wage to be liveable in large cities does nothing , as it completely fails to address the supply/demand issue . if they dont vote on their pay it goes up automatically . so if their pay goes up min wage should go up even in cities , minimum wage is enough to buy the cheapest apartments and cheapest necessities . given let ’s say 30 hours a week , that would be 240 a week , or 960 a month at the bare minimum . even at the most expensive cities , small one person apartments can be around $ 600 . so that leaves you with $ 360 spare , let ’s say roughly 200 is for groceries , that leaves you with $ 160 dollars for extra luxuries like air conditioning , internet , and extra clothing . so even at the bare minimum of 1 minimum wage job , is enough to support a person with maybe a little extra money . minimum wage should be a direct percentage of politicians making decisions about minimum wage . ops rent-tied-to-wage suggestion may not be economically feasible but the minimum wage increase and/or wage subsidies are long overdue . the minimum wage has not kept up with inflation and rising cost of living . anyone suggesting otherwise should examine what they personally have to gain from the status-quo or why the think it 's ok for 78 % of hard working full-time workers to live paycheck-to-paycheck and 40 million americans to live in poverty . if minimum , the largest employers have an incentive to offer extremely limited below-market housing to decrease the wage they pay . if median , poor people would be discriminated against if they live in a more affluent area - goodbye , any minimum wage employees in california . what we need is some real effort to get minimum wage people into better paying jobs by helping them develop their skill . raising minimum wage only increases the number of people who are happy with what they got and dont want to move up . minimum wage is n't designed for people to live off of while working part time . it 's designed for entry level jobs that require little to no experience . i made minimum wage until i started doing more to make them money . something very important to take into account is whether or not the employer can afford to run a business while bumping up the pay for every part time employee . in my case , i learned to use a forklift , i started making important deliveries , i got trained to be a field service technician , trained in crane operation , i learned to operate their specialty vehicles , i started doing extra work around the facility that adds to beautification , and so on . with each thing i started doing , i made more money . i made the company more money so they could afford to pay me more . the problem you have is n't with minimum wage , it 's with landlords . if you want to propose a law that makes it easier to afford housing , do so without making it harder for employers to pay their employees . if everybody gets a raise and you are n't making more , that means employees got ta go . you make more money , they charge you more , so you make more money , so they charge you more ... by your logic it just would n't work . introduce a standard income for all unemployed that will encourage businesses to pay above that level should throw in that any building to be purchased for use as a rental unit should be required to be a local buyer . no more jackasses sitting in an office "" managing "" an apartment complex 60 miles away . no more asshats from other countries buying property and charging ridiculous rent for buildings they do n't even look at let alone upkeep minimum wage should be tied to gdp so when the economy does well , so does everyone in it . minimum wage is not intended to be a liveable wage , most minimum wage jobs require little to no valuable skills ( which is to say they are something anyone can do , simple , not necessarily easy ) . highschool / college kids or someone looking for a part time job to make a little extra cash . if you are not satisfied with how much you are making you can negotiate your pay , try to move up , or find a new job . being a garbage man or janitor , for example , pays well but people actively avoid that kind of work ."
9q3rlu,"my right to be protected as an american trumps/is a bigger right than a foreign national ’s “ right ” to enter or immigrate to the united states . the us welfare system should be inaccessible to non citizens . i believe my right to be protected ( from terrorism , contagious disease , crime , etc ) should outweigh someone ’s else “ right ” to enter or migrate to the united states . as a citizen of this country , i contribute to the economy , understand the laws of the land , do not use or take advantage of the welfare system , and understand us cultural norms and values . as such , when deciding on immigration laws , the trump administration should give greater priority to my right to protection as a citizen , over consideration for the plight or aspirations of foreign nationals who want to come here . a person close to me let ’s call him joe has grandfathers who fought for the us in the civil war , both world wars , and vietnam . when joe reached his mid twenties , he engaged in drug use and alcohol , eventually becoming homeless . at no time during the course of his life did he sign up to receive welfare , which he could have done , and would have made his life easier . instead , joe got clean and joined the workforce . the current model of our welfare system has been taken advantage of by too many immigrants at the expense of the american people , and the decedents of those who fought and died for this country . i am referring to the many immigrants who come here on a visa , obtain a green card , and sign up for welfare for their family of 7-10 ( 5 + kids , some born aboard ) . this particular group of immigrants then find work for cash ( no taxes ) while receiving income from other sources aboard . the us government does n’t see what money they actually have , and as part of welfare , sends the family monthly checks . meanwhile , the parents live comfortably off of savings , and exploit the system for personal gain . i have friends who are social workers and have told me this is a common phenomenon they see . the social worker goes to provide complimentary services on behalf of the state , and finds mom/dad driving a nice vehicle while qualifying for welfare and receiving free education for their 7 kids . it is not a birthright that foreign nationals have to be able to immigrate to the united states by virtue of it being the “ land of opportunity . ” did their ancestors fight and die so we can have our freedoms today ? no . this is not their home . it is a privilege and i think honor to come here . welfare should only be provided to us citizens , so that the current ways by which the welfare system is unfairly taken advantage of through loopholes is stopped . i believe joe deserved more from his country during his moment of crisis . i believe it means something that so many members of his family fought and died for this country . joe ’s right to welfare ( which he could have accessed but chose not to ) is an actual right . “ poor ” immigrants who come here under the guise of poverty who in reality have bank accounts and pension plans in their home countries - should not be allowed access to welfare until and if - they obtain citizenship .","just trying to understand your argument ; are you saying that this is n't the case ( it 's too easy to get into the united states illegally ) , or that you want the existing rules to be strengthened so that it 's even harder for people to legally immigrate here ? permanent residents require a sponsor , who will be financially responsible for the immigrant and prevent their using welfare . or maybe it has drastically changed in the previous 25 years since my 2nd cousin from ireland needed a sponsor when he got a green card . where are the sponsors of these immigrants , and where are they getting welfare benefits where they do n’t check on their sponsors who should be taking care of the immigrants that they are responsible for ? immigrants ( illegal/undocumented ) actually contribute into much of the economy especially through social security which they will never be able to get back and use even though they paid into it . since everyone else here has already countered your points regarding immigration , i 'm going to take on a recurring theme in your post : that your ancestors accomplishments entitle you to benefits that others should n't get . how does the fact that "" joe 's great grandfather fought in the civil war and joe 's grandfather fought in wwii "" entitle joe for more benefits ? so why should joe get priority over the benefits america has to offer . i do n't know joe 's ancestors , but they most likely answered the call to service because the country needed them in a moment of crisis . yet you seem to be of the mindset that because joe was the sperm of a sperm of a sperm who sacrificed , that he should reap the benefits of that victory . this is why many immigrant communities succeed over natural born americans . it used to be the "" welfare queen "" and now it is immigrants . the implication that people are getting rich off of welfare has no basis in reality . i am confused why you think that joe deserved more when you say that he never signed up to receive benefits . the us welfare system is already largely inaccessible to noncitizens . professional visa holders are explicitly forbidden from using welfare - not that they would want to because they are working in good jobs . the closest thing to "" welfare "" that they receive is the ability for their minor children to attend public school for "" free "" . new green card recipients can not receive welfare for the first five years - exceptions being spouses of citizens who fell on bad times for example . even then , there are income thresholds to meet before marriage based green cards are granted , and many immigrants only receive green cards through employment anyway ( e.g. h1b ) . if you 're seeing first generation immigrants using welfare , chances are they already naturalized as citizens . it 's abhorrent how many us citizens in need are neglected by the government , but do you honestly think it directly is a result of resources going to foreigners ? there is corruption and massive wastage in countless levels of government ( military is an easy one ) . if we somehow magically halt the use of public resources by foreigners , i guarantee you that money is not going to find its way to the american joe regardless . regarding that first paragraph i think you u.s. americans have to be protected from yourselves before looking at any immigrants as "" threats "" . but i totally agree that there are people and families who highly exploit these welfare systems , just do n't generalize like this . ( many americans would hold that it is , but in terms of economic opportunities and standard of living , there are many countries in the world with more-or-less similar situations . ) with respect for the ability of foreigners to enter a country , if you are proposing that that should be limited , you need to consider the consequences . while the us , for example , is very diverse economically , there are areas that would be economically ruined if international tourism were to disappear . as for the rights of non-citizens to receive social benefits , understanding that in general , the us provides lower level of social support than many other countries , one needs to consider the situation . there is a difference between a non-citizen that immigrated at age ten with her family and has been a productive member of society for decades , paying taxes like a citizen , and a non-citizen that just immigrated today and expects social assistance . are you proposing that refugees from legitimate circumstances should be allowed to come , and then just set adrift - "" good luck ! canadian provinces and territories provide public health care benefits to all immigrants - even americans - once they establish local residency . if joe is white and his ancestors fought in the civil war , then it is n't unlikely that joe 's ancestors came to the us during times when immigration by particular ethnic and religious groups was highly encouraged and incentivised . had joe 's ancestors been jewish or asian they would n't have had access to any of those benefits . the benefits extended to white protestant immigrants often helped lift them and their children put of poverty so that subsequent generations have something to rely on . why would n't you extend the same benefits to current immigrants ( without the blinders of prejudice , bigotry , and racism on ) so that their children can also prosper ? \ > as a citizen of this country , i contribute to the economy , understand the laws of the land , do not use or take advantage of the welfare system , and understand us cultural norms and values . none of those things naturally follow from the fact that you 're a citizen , nor are they requirements for maintaining citizenship . on the other hand , there are reasonably stringent requirements for being able to legally immigrate to and work in the us . given that , i have trouble with the idea that immigrants contribute less to american society than native born citizens or are any less deserving of government support . i 'm also curious on the source of your ideas about immigrants . aside from anecdotes from your social worker friend , who by definition is unlikely to interact with the best ( or even average ) examples of any group , where did your understanding of immigrants come from ? that your well-being and prosperity as an american citizen trump the interests of a foreign national to enter or immigrate into the united states . to pick a country at random , turkey places a higher priority on the well-being of its citizens than on the desires of non-turkish people , and if you as an american tried to immigrate to turkey and your presence was deemed non-beneficial to the turkish people , you 'd be gone . your second cmv is that once a foreign national is residing in the united states , they should not be given access to the welfare system until they 're a citizen . first , i think it 's important to figure out precisely what your concern is : do you have an issue with immigrants being allowed to receive welfare at all , or do you have a problem with immigrants fraudulently receiving welfare ? i can find you plenty of examples of natural-born americans who do not contribute to the economy , do not understand the laws , do take advantage of the welfare system ( interesting fact , it 's mostly conservatives in conservative states who do this , not immigrants ) , and americans who do not understand us cultural norms and values ( which barely exist since we 're so big a nation and are already diverse ) . i can find you plenty of examples of immigrants who do contribute to the economy , understand the laws , do n't take advantage of welfare ( because they actually ca n't ) , and do understand cultural norms and values where they 're from . secondly , you 're falling victim to a belief so many conservatives do ( and i will label you as one regardless of how you identify , to be honest ) . here 's the thing though : welfare saves us money and helps our economy . too many fox news anchors have convinced people that welfare is expensive because you 're theoretically spending money , but they 're not . the wealth people generate in an economy is more than their income . welfare abuse really does n't happen , and most people on welfare are already working a lot . most people on welfare are already doing what you think they should be doing . do you believe that with the current model of immigration ( the legal immigration process ) your safety is threatened , despite the fact there is data out there that shows legal immigrants cause less crime ( and illegal ones too , when adjusted for age ) , bring and spread less disease ( with us natives travelling abroad and back bringing more ) , and have caused a proportionally low number of terrorist acts ( especially if we 're talking about ' immigrants ' as in people entering the country legally , and we 're not counting the vast amount of native-on-native crimes that the doj does n't classify as ' terrorism ' like most mass shootings ) pretty much any data i can find on welfare programs in general has the benefits recieved by green card holders ( a process that takes years on average , i should remind you ) are exclusive to the green card holder , and most are not in the form of cash bur rather non-cash welfare intended to keep the subject healthy ( emergency medicaid ) , fed ( snap/chip ) , and educated ( public education , and in some states state-born rates for tuition but not state-born tuition assistance ) . the law is designed to prevent immigrants from becoming a public charge , and shaping them into productive members of society , pretty much like it is for native-born americans . hell , undocumented immigrants can even get workers ' compensation and some other on-the-job benefits , which means it makes sense for them to work in the edge of legality with fake social security numbers , and pay the same taxes citizens do ( which now finance a good chunk of social security for aging americans , particularly retiring baby boomers . ) many non-citizens ( who are permanent residents and may intend to apply for citizenship in the future ) contribute to the economy , understand the laws of the land , do n't use welfare , and understand us cultural norms and values ( though they may have their own cultural practices ) . should long-term , legal residents who are n't citizens still be barred from receiving welfare benefits in the event they need them , even if they contribute to the system ? many immigrants do not sign up for welfare , and most immigrant families are far smaller than 5 + kids . and a lot of immigrants find work that is taxed , while plenty of non-immigrant citizens also work for cash under the table and receive cash from abroad . again , though , many of the problems you 're referring to likely do n't apply to many if not the majority of legal immigrants ."
9q2qi2,"on abortions personally , i think the government should not subsidize abortions at all . this would stop the whole debate over pro-life/pro-choice . i think the doctor should negotiate a fee with the patient or go through insurance ( if they 'll pay for abortion ) like any other medical procedure done . secondly , since an abortion is basically the mother opting out of motherhood , i believe the father should be able to opt out of fatherhood as well . during the same time period where a pregnant girl can abort the unborn baby , the father can choose to opt out by signing a form releasing all parental rights to the baby . ( i do n't know how it would work where the woman does not tell the father about the pregnancy until after the baby is born . but i 'm sure politicians or someone on reddit can come up with a decent solution to it ) third , since mothers can abort an unborn baby without any criminal punishment ( murder ) ; a person who kills a pregnant woman and thus the unborn baby , that person should not be charged with a murder of the unborn baby who is still within that time frame of being aborted .","furthermore , going through insurance or negotiating fees could be really dangerous for certain groups of people . those who are underage , victims of incest , were raped or people who ca n't afford an abortion , much less a child , would be forced to negate to more dangerous methods . for instance , in alabama the law states that you have until week 20 of a pregnancy to abort ( unless mother 's life is at risk or her physical health is compromised ) whereas in florida , it 's until week 24 ( again , with the same exceptions of risk ) so if you kill a woman who is 22 weeks pregnant in florida and your best friend does the same thing but in alabama , it 's two different laws . i agree that fathers should be able to opt out of fatherhood and not pay child support . but , he needs to also give up parental rights if he wo n't pay child support . but , this should only apply in countries where abortions are safe , legal , and easily accessible to pregnant women . if the mother never tells the father until it 's born , then the same thing should apply . this does n't reflect a position , that i understand to be very common , which is that the state should make abortions illegal . abortion might be opting out of motherhood , but that 's incidental . the True purpose of abortions is to opt out of pregnancy . seeing as how the fetus has n't been aborted in this scenario , it is more probable that the woman intended for the fetus to continue growing which could be argued imparts some person 's rights to the fetus ; or alternatively that the fetus had a right to life all along and that the abortion is merely the overriding of that right by the woman 's right to bodily autonomy . despite what republicans would tell you , the hyde amendment has existed since 1976 and prohibits use of federal funds for abortion except to save the life of the mother or in cases of rape or incest . the reason the mother is given the option is that she is forced to carry the baby to term in a difficult and exhaustive process . i 'll admit that i do n't really see the benefit to allowing more deadbeat dads in a society already rife with children who are n't taken care of . in legal terms , it means that bodily autonomy should be a right that women naturally have . i , as a ( pro life ) person , would say that abortion is an enforcement method of woman 's natural right to bodily autonomy . but unfortunately today 's government could n't afford the financial burden of paying for the child 's father . what you are trying here to is to establish the principle of equality ( if woman can abort , men should be able to relinquish the responsibility ) . if abortion is an enforcement method for woman 's natural right 's , then this rationale fails entirely . and that women , without abortion do n't have the natural right 's men automatically poses . in fact , the allegory here would be : because women now have equal bodily right 's to men , men must posses additional right 's women do n't have to compensate . even if baby had the full right 's of an adult person . it still would n't be murder , as abortion is legally sanctioned by state . where as murder , reffers to the illegal aspect of ending someone 's life , that does not constitute manslaughter . i kinda agree , but that 's just because i do n't consider the fetus a person . since pregnant women are protected class , if the reason for her murder was due to her pregnancy , it would absolutely add massively to the sentence . in the same way killing a disabled person , or a person of color ( various hate laws , etc. . when a woman is pregnant and had no thoughts of abortion . killing her meant that she gave her consent to starting a family , which would extent the protections of the law even on her unborn kids ."
9q1y27,"victimless crimes should n't be illegal now i 'll preface this by stating the achilles ' heek of my argument outright - it 's effectively impossible to define what is and is n't truly victimless . for the purpose of discussion , i define victimless as an act that does not directly impact the wellbeing or comfort of any person or persons in a meaningful way . i would add the stipulation this extends to needless significant damage to the environment , as it is of net detriment to the human race . my argument is fairly simple . if an act lacks a clear detrimental effect on other human beings , what does the state or the ' criminal ' gain from the act being prohibited ?","for similar reasons we make suicide illegal , not because of any moral judgement , or because of some perceived state/collective right to a suicidal person 's life , but because a society that has no recourse for forcing a suicidal person to get help functions less well . the loved ones of suicidal people may feel their only recourse is to illegally detain a suicidal person , which again turns good people into criminals , because they wanted to prevent the death of their suicidal loved ones . suicide causes chaos in the lives of people around the suicidal person , which disrupts society . so we 've learned , through trial and error , that it 's better to make suicide illegal so there 's legal justification for using force to prevent someone from committing suicide , and to get them treatment , which we 've learned is actually pretty effective at preventing future attempts . obviously determining what laws help society function better is an imperfect science , both because of the subjective nature of better , and because of the complexity of society and it 's interaction with laws , but that 's , to my mind , the most useful framework for evaluating laws . child porn , even drawn , is illegal because it would lead to a demand for the real thing . when you do n't pay taxes everyone get hurt when the state get less money , but when you draw a caricature of mohammed , people see it as a direct attack on their religion . as examples for "" victimless "" you mentioned recreational drug use , which could affect your judgment , ability to drive safely , your perception of reality etc. , for all of these you have an increased risk of doing something stupid and harming others , or ignore someone a risk to others . you also mentioned suicide that could hurt your family and friends , and homosexuality that is also viewed as an attack on specific religious groups . drug use - for example - can result in impairment that affects children of users , other drivers on the road , your place of work , etc . what if say smoking meth most of the time as shown to be victimless but there is an undeniable connection between smoking meth and violent crime ? theorists have split criminal offences into two types : mala in se and mala prohibita . crimes that are mala in se are morally wrong without any law that prohibits them e.g. even if there was no law prohibiting rape , that would not make it right . crimes that are mala prohibita are criminal because you 've broken some rule e.g. running a red light . it is often difficult ( though not impossible ) to nail down some moral nexus with mala prohibita crimes , and a lot of them could be classed as victimless . john stuart mill wrote that the only purpose for which power ( in our case the criminal law ) can be rightfully exercised over a member of a civil community is to prevent harm to others . feinberg has gone even further by stating that conduct which creates a risk of harm should also fall within the harm principle . so if someone drives drunk , they may not have caused harm , but they certainly create a risk of harm . people , however , usually have two problems with the harm principle . it 's over-inclusive - if i break my girlfriend 's heart then that 's technically harm so it should be illegal ( although feinberg might say this is n't a public harm , whatever that is supposed to mean ) . technically there was no "" harm "" done here , life carries on as normal . your post hits more on point ( 2 ) - what do we do with criminal law when there is no harm to anyone ? unfortunately , there is no single answer or principle that determines whether certain conduct should be criminalized . smoking weed in your own home , for example , may meet ( 5 ) , but it would certainly infringe on ( 4 ) as that would make the criminal law overly paternalistic ( but of course , conservatives may say it meets ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 3 ) so we can forgo ( 4 ) ) . the so-called "" victimless rape "" may not strictly meet ( 2 ) but it definitely meets ( 1 ) , ( 5 ) , and even ( 3 ) . tldr : i do n't necessarily agree that all victimless crimes should be legal , but asking ourselves if a crime is truly victimless is the first step on deciding whether it should be criminal at all . if an act lacks a clear detrimental effect on other human beings , what does the state or the ' criminal ' gain from the act being prohibited ? sure , victimless crimes effect nobody directly or immediately , but to legalize them would only increase their rates . so if we as a society should legalize victimless crimes , Truely victimless crimes i should say , then we need to look at the benefits . one of your examples is suicide , but if you commit suicide that has negative effects on everyone in your life . i think that the view on harm to environment depends on intent . but if you ’re dumping your home trash into a lake , or purposefully harm the environment , that should be illegal because that directly harms society but the intent is known to be a malicious intent . one unstated premise you have is that laws are made for good . one would reason that members of that caucus would have principled objections to some of those votes , but are constrained by threats of withdrawal of campaign support or other heavy handed tactics to vote for measures they oppose ethically . the danger is once we cross the boundary to try and then extend the lessons of the hypothetical back to the real . you are entirely correct that it is effectively impossible to define what is or is not victimless . because of this , it is also effectively impossible to argue unless you provide some examples of what you would consider to be victimless . by this definition , and any other definition of victimless crime i 've seen , there are no victimless crimes . whether it 's recreational drug use or prostitution , these crimes produce incentive models that do affect the lives of uninvolved people . legal , unregulated prostitution would inevitably produce an incentive for human trafficking and crime gangs . likewise , the purchase of illegal drugs funds gangs and global supply chains ( such as for heroin ) that do n't commit drug sales as their only crime . necessarily , all actions , and all crimes , have victims by the way that they change incentives to do right and wrong . would not a dirty neighborhood lower housing/building prices and buy rates for the residents and owners there - thus ceasing to become harmless ?"

9q1bzy,"media coverage of jamal khashoggi 's murder exposes the deep immorality of american foreign policy the saudi arabian government ( and mohammad bin salman ) has been accused of murdering a journalist , jamal khashoggi . the details of the murder are extremely grisly . outrage has been rippling throughout the media along with demands for justice and talk of saudi arabia being an authoritarian regime . this is all justified in my opinion . however , the real crime is that this is the event that set off these calls . & #x200b ; saudi arabia has been an anti-democratic state much before this . it 's a literal monarchy . foreign workers are used as slaves . there is no trial by jury . gay people get the death penalty . there is no religious freedom . & #x200b ; additionally , saudi arabia has been using tactics of famine and disease to wage war on rebels in the arabian peninsula 's poorest country , yemen . this war is considered by many the worst man-made humanitarian crisis of our lifetimes . famine and disease tactics affect the entire population , not just rebels . nobody knows how many people have died . save the children estimates that 50,000 children died in 2017 . how often do we hear about this ? & #x200b ; i see multiple articles each day by individual outlets about the murder of khashoggi and demanding that mbs be brought to justice , but how much time do they spend talking about the yemen war or his authoritarian domestic policy ? barely any . how can one person 's life be so much more important than the 10,000 s that have died in the war ? & #x200b ; i understand the instinct to defend this because he 's a journalist and in the u.s. we protect journalists because we see them as people who bring truth to light . however , elevating this single man 's murder to being the primary reason for our criticism of mbs obscures the truth purposefully . it degrades the principle that we hold so high . & #x200b ; the reason is that saudi government is a close ally of the united states in their conflict against iran , as well as the world 's largest buyer of american arms . the american government and media does n't care if they kill thousands of innocent civilians as long as those two things keep happening . they wo n't however tolerate the murder of a washington post columnist . the washington post is one of the largest publications in the u.s . they would look weak if they did n't prosecute this somehow . & #x200b ; while khashoggi 's murder was an atrocity , it 's publicity and the outrage around it is extremely disproportionate and exposes of fundamental failing of the american media . change my view","i think it definitely emphasizes it in a way , but realistically i do n't see it as exposing anything because u.s foreign policy has been apparently immoral for a very long time . maybe i 'm being pedantic , but "" expose "" to me is a rather strong word and i do n't feel it reflects the attitudes of the average american leading up to this . i also think that , however wrong , the reason we are particularly enraged about this situation is the who , where , and how . and if we ca n't send our journalists to sa without fear of them being cut up and killed ... that 's problematic . additionally , the fact that it occured at a foreign consulate is even more cause for concern . those are supposed to be places of peace , and in my eyes doing what they did is n't a whole lot different than brutally murdering one of our diplomats or other such things ."
9q0sqw,"guns are necessary to maintain a free state , and gun control has never worked . if the citizens do n’t have guns , they ca n’t defend themselves , if they ca n’t defend themselves they ca n’t defend their rights , therefore they can be conquered . a citizenry without guns just empowers a government to engage in tyrannical acts , and immediately gives all the power to the government . to maintain a free state the power needs to reside in the people , if this does n’t hold True then it means the government does n’t need the consent of the people to make decisions . guns also have many other benefits , like defense against robbery , and an impressively high success rape prevention rate . conservative estimates of deterrence against crime with guns are 1,900,000 yearly in the usa . gun control is an ineffective way of attacking gun violence . a full gun ban or a ban on “ assault rifles ” has never conclusively been proven to reduce homicides . in fact the gun ban in england only caused homicides to rise , and to this day the homicide rate has n’t been lower than the year the gun ban took action . in australia the homicide rate remained steady for the coming years , and even peaked in 1999 and 2003 , in those years the homicide rate was higher than the year before the gun ban . furthermore , australia now has more guns than before the buyback . the assault rifle gun ban of 1994/2004 that took place in the usa has n’t been proven to reduce gun crime nor homicides .","the claim that gun control has never worked also depends on what working means ... does it just mean crime rate ? if private guns are required for a free state then why has the uks tyrannical government not subjugated the population and abolished democracy yet ? what can civilians armed with guns do against an army equipped with fighter jets , tanks , drones , nukes , or laser freakin ' weapons ? "" if i was asked to chop down a tree in 10 hours , i 'd spend 8 hours sharpening my axe "" . so if a convicted murderer wants to purchase an assault rifle , and literally declares their intent to murder as many people as possible , you feel like this should be allowed , because you do n't believe in gun control ? surely the above situation is an example of someone you would n't want having a gun - surely there is some level of gun control in which you would like to be seen , like not allowing the above person to have any type of weapon they would like ? i think most people imagine that owning guns to fight the government was what the 2nd amendment was all about . my view , and i think hamilton 's , was that if the militia was source of the governments power , that there were no standing army and it was reliant on the militia to fight , then tyranny would be impossible . since you are using a government defense case i 'll say it 's a government ordered police officer come to arrest you for rebellion . or the officer can just grab it while you 're asleep . my point here is , sure , you and your four ballsy neighbors can form a local squadron of civilians to fight off an evil establishment , but would n't it be a hell of a late easier to just vote a more stable government into office ? i du n no when i see school shootings my first thought is to protect the children , not the guns and arming the masses with deadly weapons doesnt seem like the safer bet . i just want to focus on the first half of your cmv , which is that guns are necessary to defend a free state against the threat of tyranny . so to give you an example of the last question , when the patriot act was passed a month after 9/11 , which curtailed civil liberties in the name of national security , some people thought it was tyrannical and some people thought it was vital for national security . for the sake of argument , let 's assume half of the population fell into each group . the murder rate is way lower the the usa , the gun related suicide rate is lower . giving people guns is a much poorer way to arrange this than setting up the democratic system so there 's lots of checks and balances and it 's difficult for people to amass excessive political power . guns are more often used to enforce tyranny , rather than defend from it . take a look at the mass shooting rate in australia since strong gun control was brought in . yet every developed country with stricter gun laws and fewer guns per capita have much lower homicide rates . also more guns has been linked to more homicide in many studies . the data shows no clear trend , suggesting that something else is contributing to the homicide rate , and that you definitely ca n't make a causal relationship like that . australia 's gun buyback happened in response to a mass shooting . plus we do n't even have universal background checks ... however we do know that fully-automatic weapons are very hard to get , and have practically never been used in crimes in the u.s."
9pyolh,"shelby v. holder is a bigger example of judicial activism in the last 30 years than anything that conservatives can point to the liberal justices doing . taking the definition of judaical activism as : court rulings made based on political or personal views of the judges presiding over the case . the reading i have of shelby v. holder is basically that the majority justices decided that the voting rights act in the year 2013 unconstitutionally violated the principle of federalism by nature of it being too out of date . the majority of them conceded that congress has the power to pass this lay to enforce the 14th and 15th amendment , but claimed that it was too out of date , so we should throw it out . given that they conceded that this violation of federalism was allowed , but they just thought it was too old , and that it had been re-approved by congress just 6 years earlier , it was a blatant attempt to impose their own personal or political views onto us law . chief justice roberts writes "" there is no denying , however , that the conditions that originally justified these measures no longer characterize voting in the covered jurisdictions "" but that claim is not in fact undeniable . the arguments he presents that they are undeniable are the same arguments one would use to present that the voting rights act is working . he even writes that voting discrimination exists . the picking apart of the statute and striking of formulas and methods , rather than the denial of the power of congress to enact such laws show how the court was applying it 's own opinions on voter suppression rather than the opinions of the legislature .","while i understand that the voting rights act is important , and i do think that the kinds of provisions that were contained in the stricken-down portions are probably necessary , the fact is that in modern times they were pretty arbitrarily enforced . the voting rights act listed specific districts with a history of discriminating against black voters , and said that those districts should be subject to special scrutiny . those districts listed in the act were based on data from the time the act passed , which was quite out of date . the legal argument is that , while the provisions of the act are within the power of the legislature to enact , the basis for them is no longer relevant because some of the required districts may no longer be discriminating , and other districts not covered by the act might be . the right to privacy makes sense to me when striking down bans on contraception . i think that decision would have been more properly made by legislatures . that state legislatures would not have acted for many years and more women would have been harmed seeking unsafe abortions had the court not ruled as it did . but this i think is to argue that the court was and is justified in its activism , rather than arguing that these rulings are not activist . we 'll call union dues "" compelled speach "" making it a first amendment violation , depriving the legislature of any remedy short of a constitutional amendment . further , let 's premptively rule an opt-out mechanism is also unconstitutional and require explicit opt-in for no other reason than it makes union organizing harder ."

9pwxrj,"conservatives and libertarians adore the electoral college precisely because they know full well that they do n’t represent the views of a majority of americans . this is a phenomenon that has come up recently a couple of times , most notably the recent presidential election . when it came out that hillary clinton had lost despite having ~ 3 million more popular votes than trump , conservative types trotted out the defense that “ america was designed as a republic , not a democracy ! ” that in and of itself is a factual statement , so i ca n’t fault them there . but as for why exactly they ’re so proud of it , i can contest . for all their talk of avoiding “ tyranny of the majority ” and “ 2 wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for dinner ” , i just do n’t believe that it ’s about principles for them . looking at the positions they represent , it ’s pretty clear they represent the minority of america , especially the rich and those who live in rural areas . if elections were decided purely by popular vote , conservative candidates would never win a single contest . they are n’t opposed to popular vote on a principle basis ; they ’re opposed to it because they know full well people do n’t like them and the current system allows them to win anyways . tl , dr ; conservatives ’ love of the electoral college has nothing to do with fairness and everything to do with the fact that they would be destroyed if every vote was counted equally . i ’m writing this on mobile and fresh out of bed , so forgive me if this comes off as rambling or incoherent . i ’ll clarify my views in the comments if asked .","as such , by standard dictionary definitions , republics are definitionally democracies . a candidate has to have so many points to win the election . remove ec and replace with popular vote , then you remove the "" point "" system . this makes it waaaaaaaay easier to commit useful voter fraud . now remove ec and count each individual vote , you now give each voting district in the whole us the ability to commit meaningful mass voter fraud . no area is uncapped in output , so one lone district can destroy the legitimacy of the entire election , rather than just one state 's votes . for example , in ec if a group wanted to commit meaningful voter fraud , they would have to gather help from across the entire us to commit fraud in as many states as possible . in popular vote , they can just mass fraud their sole district and achieve better results . i 'm just going to take issue with you saying libertarians adore the electoral college . i read the whole post but i 'm extremely left leaning and i support the electoral college . the reason i do , is because it impossible for an entire population of 300,000,000 + people to have a sufficient level of expertise to appropriately weight in on every political topic they vote on . the electoral college solves this , by giving the general population a stake in the vote by electing representatives , and then allowing paid representatives to study and best represent the will of their constituency . the electoral college can remove the unscientific nature of consensus by having a group of people whose job it is , resolve that issue . that all being said , being in favor of the electoral college is a perfectly defensible decision as a result . consensus is unscientific and we should not be making unscientific decisions about how we establish policy in the first place . each state either ratified the constitution or specifically petitioned for admission based on the rules of the constitution . these rules very clearly included the us senate with equal representation for each state , independent of population and the electoral college . even more so , why since 2007 , a combination of states representing a ' majority ' of the ec votes has not ratified the national popular vote interstate compact ? this would sidestep the amendment process to give a popular vote anyway via agreement between states . i think you will find that for the majority of the states in the us , the ec represents a check on the power of the largest states . political parties want power and will shift their platform to whatever is most likely to get them to win . the gop is n’t ideological , it is just choosing a bunch of talking points that they think will get it the most votes . and by votes i do n’t mean direct democratic votes , i mean getting them to win whatever the current rules of the contest are . if it ended up being direct democracy then they would choose a different platform and use super sophisticated marketing to do whatever is needed to win that way . i think there 's a lot to be said about election reform and i 'm not a huge fan of the electoral college . is the popular vote really less likely to give us donald trump ( by dt , i really mean any leader of his ... character ) than the electoral college ? overall i think you make a good point , and you 're probably right . i think my main problem with the electoral college is that it means in some ways the fewer can rule over the majority . i think it 's also important to note that sometimes the electoral college does n't really benefit republicans . after all , it 's a pretty rare occurance where the the winner loses the popular vote ( though it has happened twice since the turn of the millenia ) . i think total election reform is better than converting to the popular vote . the main reason for this being that the way things are now basically makes it impossible for anything more than bipartisan leadership , along with the idea that realistically fully democratic elections are somewhat idealistic . you have n't really given a reason as to why you think they do n't genuinely believe that it protects small states ' rights ( etc. ) . "" republics "" are n't separate from democracies , they 're separate from monarchies . while most state allow the electors to vote however they want they tend to vote as their state voted and no election has ever been decided by a rogue vote . and our method is far more democratic than a parliamentary system which does not even have any input from the public on choosing a prime minister . the electoral college mitigates against that , by counting the majority of votes in each state , not the whole country the reasonable assumption you make from this is that republicans always have an electoral college advantage , but democrats had an electoral college advantage in 2004 , 2008 , and 2012 . it would increase their votes in the legislature from 0 % to 5 % . conservatives do n't usually care about electors , but are fine with state-centric votes . she got roughly 5 million more votes than trump from california and new york state alone . can you say that trump would n't have gotten the popular vote ? he clearly strategized and outsmarted hillary clinton and the entirety of the democrats when the goal was the electoral college , can you honestly say it 's a lock he would have lost otherwise ? without the electoral college the question of who would become president would basically come down to urban areas with leftist voters and the other half of the country would n’t be represented . i ’d argue that democrats want to get rid of the electoral college because they know full well that they ’ll virtually control the executive branch if they do . excellent points , particularly regarding sparsely populated swing states becoming more important than the most populous that are clearly red ( texas ) or blue ( california ) . i suppose optimal campaign strategy is really dependent on the rules of the game . however , if the rules were altered so that the team that scored the most runs won the series , then the yankees would have won . this is primarily because they had 1 game in that series where they obliterated the pirates 19-2 . you might even say that many of those extra yankees ’ runs during this game were less valuable than other runs . if the yankees could have distributed those extra 16 runs from their victory margin a little differently , then the outcome would have been changed . somehow , i do n’t think that yankees fans were clamoring to suddenly change the rules that had been in place for the better part of a century merely because it would have favored them to do so . they would also understand that previous world series likely would have ended up with different victors had the rules been different . even though most of the time , the team that outscores the other usually wins more games and the series . one last note - if you have n’t seen the blue / red county breakdown of how the voting went across the country , you should check it out . yeah , i know that ’s not how the ec works either , but in lieu of the popular vote candidate not winning , it gives a pretty stark view of a sea of red with a few small islands of dark blue . could one really look at the map color breakdown like that and say that the will of the nation as a whole was n’t accurately represented in the outcome ? or put another way , should 15 cities 1000 + miles away silence the voices of entire states like north dakota or wyoming ? the president presides over states , so it has to be the states that choose . but , the more populous states get more electoral votes anyway , so i happen to think it ’s a pretty balanced system as it is . and yes , every so often the team that scores more runs in the series loses . the people that are currently complaining about the electoral college are mad about recent events not going their way . i do n't think its that conservatives and libertarians "" adore "" it , just that they are n't going to let this motivated reasoning slide by without calling it out . the other implication here is that the results of the election would have been different if the rules were different . maybe , but the other thing to consider is that the candidates would have played the game differently . if the popular vote was the deciding factor , trump would have ran the campaign in a different way . lets say we repeal the electoral college and then trump wins the popular vote , but loses the theoretical ec vote . do you think the opposition would just accept it , or would we get the same argument "" this is n't fair the other candidate would have won if we still have the ec "" . in the simplest terms , the electoral college was created with the constitution as a balance between population-based and state-based powers of governing , as reflected in the difference between the house and the senate . and the smaller , more rural states lacking those concentrated hubs of populations would not have signed onto the constitution without things like the ec and the senate , per fears of the “ tyranny of the majority ” . the ec protects the rural voices of the nation because they specifically are n’t as numerous or as concentrated . the electoral college was designed for a more libertarian system where states had more autonomy , the federal government and especially the executive branch had less power , and the average person did n't have to care who 's president . everyone has equal per capita representation at the state level , which is where the main battleground for policy takes place , and a small federal government represents the states . i agree that the combination of electoral college and large federal government with minimal state autonomy is disastrous . but it makes sense that people who want less federal government and a stronger democracy at the state level are in favor of the electoral system that accompanies that idea . libertarians are against democracy and the state so we do n't adore the electoral college . you 're greatly overestimating the amount of advantage possible with the electoral college . you 're also ignoring that campaigns would be run differently if the electoral college were removed . second , candidates would campaign with the new goal in mind , so for example the 2016 election would not have had the same numbers because the candidates would both have campaigned differently . ben shapiro lives in california , a blue state whose outcome in 2016 was certain before the race even started . he had significant objections to trump , so he did n't vote for him . if his vote could have made a difference , it 's much more likely he would have voted for him . i ended up feeling comfortable voting for gary johnson , because i live in a blue state . if the electoral college were gone , then my vote would really matter , and i would have ended up voting for trump . what we 're doing here is showing the principles that support our side . it is n't so much that we have a love for the electoral college as that you guys hate it , and we need to respond to your criticisms ."
9pw37o,"civilian deaths from the use of chemical weapons are no more or less morally abhorrent than civilian deaths from the use of conventional explosive/incendiary weapons . i understand that there is a taboo around chemical weapons due to international law , but i 'm thinking that , on a practical level , there is no reason why we should view their use specifically against and/or without regard for civilians as any more heinous than similar uses of conventional weaponry . i 'm afraid i simply do n't see any moral difference between a civilian dying in agony from asphyxiation as a result of exposure to some form of nerve gas ( which usually takes minutes ) , and a civilian dying in agony from asphyxiation/traumatic injury as a result of being trapped in the rubble of a building that came down on top of them after being hit by an explosive weapon ( which can often take hours or days ) . when it comes to incendiary weapons like phosphorus or napalm , the distinction is even more blurred - innocent people dying in horrific burning pain as collateral from an incendiary weapon strike does n't seem any less of a tragedy to me than civilians suffocating in neuromuscular paralysis due to a chemical weapon strike . i guess the notion of one torturous death being morally more permissible than another torturous death simply due to the way it is inflicted does n't sit right with me .","the consequences of chemical weapons are generally more far reaching than conventional and incendiary weapons . on the other hand land mine use has gone down considerably as a result . to start , if we shoot one person in the head and they die , and we take another person and torture them for weeks for no reason and then kill them , do you think those are morally equal ? now the enemy drops more chemical weapons on us , it does absolutely nothing to our highly prepared soldiers , so it 's really just an attack on civilians at this point . now yes , civilian deaths are bad no matter how they occur , but at least with conventional arms you can justify their use because while there are unintended civilian casualties , at least there are intended military casualties that hopefully outnumber the civilians . now , if you 're talking about targeting civilians with conventional arms , yeah , maybe there is an argument that that is equal to targeting civilians with chemical weapons , but it 's not like deliberately targeting civilians is seen as a good thing in the civilized world . civilian deaths ( and injuries ) from chemical weapons are equally as bad as civilian deaths ( or injuries ) from traditional weapons . but the nature of chemical weapons makes civilian casualties way more likely than other , more targeted weapons . if they 're being used in any inhabited place ( as opposed to attacking an armed fortification ) harming civilians is a feature of chemical weapons , not an unwanted side effect . you have to trace the roots back to usually the first world war , though chemical warfare had been used before that in different ways ( like flinging corpses over walls and such ) . wwi was the first time the public was made to think about chemical weapons , and the first time that their use had been so severe . the True goal was to create a sort of gas that could be used to kill people quickly and without many people figuring it out - quick and odorless or tasteless . civilians could theoretically be targeted with impunity because a good attack could be undetected . soldiers might prepare and civilians might , but that would require a lot of work . you can get on some philosophical high horse which says "" wrong is wrong , so it 's all wrong "" , and sort of frame it like any nuance is a way of trying to figure out if one 's "" better "" , but the reality and history of chemical warfare has a storied past . it 's one thing to load actual troops up with supplies and dedicate resources to fighting , but it 's another to just leave something that kills indiscriminately to such a degree . civilians are killed in war but more are killed with chemical warfare . chemical weapons are mostly ineffective militarily — a gas mask renders most chemical weapons harmless . therefore the main practical use of chemical weapons is to attack non-military targets , which is to say civilians . it ’s like if someone designed ammunition that only works against children — on one level , yeah , a child killed by a normal bullet is just as tragic as a child killed by child-killing bullets . but at the same time , it would totally make sense to ban ammunition that can only be used against children . i would think it is easier to justify the use of force when the attack is more targeted , a laser targeted missile would be preferable to releasing sarin gas if you hvae a specific target in mind ."
9pw28c,"disagreements about the definition of "" racism "" are due more to the ambiguity of the word "" power "" than the contextual misuse of the word . we 've all participated in this kind of discussion that ultimately goes nowhere . a person accuses someone of being racist , another person counters and says "" no you 're racist "" , the initial person says they ca n't be racist because the definition of racism requires power and prejudice , the other person counters again saying thats not the actual definition , so on and so forth . the implication from one direction is that power in combination with racial prejudice is required for racism . this usually comes from people who do n't feel empowered . the other side often thinks that racism is done by the individual and that power has no part of the definition . we are all equal as individuals , we are all equally capable of being racist regardless of social power . being an individual denies the usage of the word racism because it is alleged invalid in this context . all of this is uninteresting . so then you have modified versions of racism like institutional/structural racism that specifically link the term to power . this sounds like a good solution to whatever confusion might occur when referring to unjust accounts of racial prejudice . except now the conversation goes like this : a person accuses someone of benefitting from institutional racism , the other person denies this , the other person mentions that the accused is a member of a categorical group that has racial privilege , the accused counters by suggesting that they are not privileged in any way . being an individual not only allows the accused to deny the accusation of racism by that definition but also makes it possible to deny a relationship to social group that is historically empowered . even less interesting . can individuals have enough power to be racist by the power/prejudice definition ? or does power only come in numbers ? does a racist action become more fundamentally racist if the specific individual has a significant amount of authority ? if a person identifies as a member of a powerful social group with a historical legacy of being racist , does that identification in itself automatically make that person racist ? do individual members of groups collectively agree to be institutionally racist ? tl ; dr what i believe is that "" racism "" is a pretty simple concept but "" power "" is extremely complex . there is a way in which we are all racists . however there is a long significant history of racial resentment in certain racial groups that is unparalleled in others . this includes individual racist resentment and institution racial prejudice . denying that you have power is a somewhat easy escape for those accused of racism , but this is really only the case if we agree that individuals in isolation can not be powerful . with that said i 'm less inclined to believe that racism by definition requires power , but i do feel its important to acknowledge that racist actions synthesize a power dynamic whether or not the racist person identifies as privileged . its less important to debate whether or not the casual definition of "" racism "" is shorthand for "" institutional racism "" if we do n't understand the significance power plays in confirmations and denials of racism . & #x200b ;","the lack of nuance or ability to analyse specific instances or situations is why this definition is n’t ever going to be accepted by wider society . most people regardless of their colour do n’t have any power so when white people are told they are powerful but there ’s no evidence given as to what power they have that the average non white person does n’t have then they will rightly reject the claim . if there was some evidence of the power the average white person has that the average non white person does n’t have then there ’s at least the chance to reflect and debate if that power exists , but the p + p definition is often just an excuse to justify double standards where it ’s ok to excuse bigoted behaviour from one side even though the actions and behaviour are exactly the same as the side that are being criticised . the people who assert that they can not be racist because of reason x are just racists that do n't want to be called racists but want to call everybody else racists in my opinion . so not only do i disagree that disagreements about the definition of racism are more due to the ambiguity of the word power than the contextual misuse of the word . i also disagree that there is any ambiguity in "" the "" definition of racism . racism is prejudice based on ethnicity or race defined by one ethnicity being seen as superior to another . so no , the arguments about racism are not derived from the ambiguity of the word power , they are based on the erroneous concept that power is involved at all . i 'm pretty sure the classical original definition of racism did not include anything of power ; that was added later . disagreements about the definition are because people simply are prone to redefine words with a hitherto commonly accepted definition because they want it to mean something else . a lot ofw ords like "" racism "" have a strong emotional connotation to them as in "" it is always bad "" and when something falls under the original definition they do n't think is bad they seek to change the definition ; this happens all the time . terms that were once descriptive often become more of a value-judgement than a descriptive term and often two terms then arise which both mean the same thing descriptive but one is used when "" bad "" and the other when "" good "" . like "" propaganda "" and "" dogma "" were once neutral descriptive terms but nowadays are purely used when the speakers disagrees with the message so when it 's positive "" information "" and "" axiom "" are used instead even though they mean the exact same thing descriptively . there is no need to define power to define racism . it is a product of american political system and completely distorts what real racism is . as an european i can tell you that it is not the first thing that comes out of america that is designed to control people in political process in america that is later propagated by idiots who do n't know when they are being brainwashed . first it 's important to note that liberals believe the whole point of government is to redistribute inflience from the traditionally wealthy and powerful and give it back to the people . if the person being racist does n't have any power they are just being mean . when a large group of people have power and use it for racist means it becomes a political issue . when you here someone say that racism = power + prejudice what they are really saying is that 's what we should be focusing on because trying to stop people from saying mean names is n't really a solveable issue ."

9pr1q6,"the state should start regulating procreation . the state should have the power conferred upon it , to regulate procreation . there should be certain thresholds and criteria limiting the ability of people to procreate . superficially , these should probably be : - income levels : e.g. people living below a certain income level that would make it difficult for them to have children , this could very well be the relative poverty level . - history of mental illness and drugs : those who have a history of substance abuse should be disallowed from having children . - criminal history : those with certain criminal histories should be barred from procreating . e.g. sexual violence . - genetic defects : e.g. mental retardation . this sort of anti-natalist policy could involve the setting up of fines to deter prospective parents , who do n't meet the criteria . radically , the state could be justified morally in removing children from parents . brining a child into the world is a massive responsibility , that is it stands , is almost entirely unregulated by the state . this is unfortunate , considering that bad parenting is probably one of the largest negative externalities . think how much better the world would be , if people who should n't become parents , did n't become parents .","regulating child bearing is such a massive massive regulatory expansion that it is going to take far more than just asserting that “ obviously some people should n’t be parents ” . you should change your view because charging people for being too poor is the absolute dumbest idea anyone has ever had . parents should only be fined after the kid is born . banning people with a history of substance abuse from having children will lead to no one willingly getting treatment for substance abuse . the kind of government that would need to be in place to institute a eugenics program like the one you describe would need to be an authoritarian state that has total control over the lives of its subjects that feels no pity or human kindness towards the weak and the suffering . income levels : this is going to be seen as racist history of mental illness : this could be used to discriminate against a group of people we got bigger problems than crowding the prisons with new parents so we can put the kids in government "" care "" .

9pr1h4,"plea deals distort justice and undermine the 6th amendment just to be clear i am referring specifically to situations where a person is offered a reduced sentence in return for pleading guilty . this creates a number of perverse incentives . & #x200b ; when there is a gap between the sentence offered in a plea deal and the theoretical maximum that could be pushed for it could lead to someone who is accused of a relatively minor crime , who would normally defend themselves in court taking the deal because the threat of a maximum sentence changes the equation . & #x200b ; the same is also True for more serious crimes . if a plea deal offers someone 2 years but if they go to court and contest it they are looking at 10 + years this to a large extent takes away the choice of someone to have a jury trial as is their 6th amendment right . if someone has a 80 % of being exonerated if they go to trial but there penalty will be increased by a factor of 5 then a person is probably foolish to take that chance . & #x200b ; rather than innocent until proven guilty it creates a system where prosecutors try and construct a carrot and stick combination that will ensure people plead guilty rather than clogging up the court with messy trials .","this is an argument to change trial practice to make the results more accurate . without plea bargains the entire justice system would grind to a halt . same with bail , if every person needed to be jailed until a trial , jails would cost trillions to run . people choose what 's best for them and that can often just be the plea deal , and in choosing to do so they implicitly waive their right to a jury trial . you 're correct that it creates perverse incentives , but the more you learn about the realities of the justice system , the better you 're likely to appreciate the concept of the plea deal ( although some are certainly more defensible than others ) . one of the critical aspects of the justice system that people outside of it do n't often realize is that most cases are "" open and shut "" , e.g. you got tackled by police running out of the bank with a ski mask on your head , a gun in one hand and a bag with a dollar sign in the other , etc . you 'll pay a lot of money for a lawyer who 'll do his best but wo n't be able to get around the fact that you were tackled coming out of the bank carrying the evidence , and the government will pay for the cost of the courtroom for your 2-3 day trial , which when you add up the salary of the judge , court clerk , prosecutor , and sheriff , is not small . the justice system also suffers in an abstract sense because there are only so many judges , meaning scheduling this trial delays the trials that definitely should be proceeding . plea deals provide an incentive for obviously guilty people not to waste everyone 's time . without that incentive , we would need to spend multiples of what we currently do on the justice system to cope with the flood of accused persons who say "" screw it , might as well fight it and hope the prosecution makes a mistake "" . also , plea offers are not typically your example of two years for an offence that would attract a sentence of ten years after trial . if the likely sentence is ten years , a plea deal might be for seven or eight years . if the prosecution offers a deal for two years in that situation , it 's an indication that they have problems with their case . maybe not enough problems to shut it down , but enough that an experienced prosecutor knows that there 's a serious chance the case will collapse at trial . it 's rare for a plea deal to be so good compared to the likely result of a conviction after trial that an innocent person would feel motivated to accept the plea ."
9ppm9u,"legislatures should always respect the will of the people in regards to ballot measures . so as an example , i live in utah and two of our ballot measures this year include creating an independent redistricting commission , and legalizing medical marijuana . both of these are polling above 50 % although , should they pass , the heavily republican legislature is threatening to modify or overturn these rulings completely . i do n't see this as ok at all , and not just because i happen to support both of these measures . i think that if a ballot measure passes , the state legislature should immediately work towards carrying out the will of the people and should under no circumstances make efforts to subvert the ruling . we elect our representatives to represent our values , and in a circumstance that there is concrete proof the citizens want something to be done , then it 's our representatives job to respect that .","there have been cases where ballot measures are explicitly mutually exclusive . if ballot measures should “ always be respected ” , then how should/can a state legislature handle logical inconsistencies in ballot measures when voters are not necessarily voting based on the logical and legal consistency , but merely upon what they want which results in inconsistent results which ca n’t both be applied ?"
9pnlvh,"“ people are going to do it anyway ” is a bad argument for legalizing something . i see this argument used on the left and the right , and i do n’t think that it ’s valid . for example : - people are going to get their hands on guns anyway , so we should n’t restrict gun ownership . if we outlaw guns , then only outlaws will have guns . - people are going to smoke weed anyway , so we should go ahead and legalize it . if weed is illegal , then people will get it off the black market , which supports cartels and introduces pot smokers to criminal elements in society . - people are going to get abortions anyway , so we should legalize them . if abortions are outlawed , women will just get back alley abortions performed in unsafe conditions . abortions should be legalized so that women who would get them anyway can do so without risking their lives . - prostitution will happen no matter what , so we should legalize it . if prostitution were legal we could tax it and regulate it . these arguments only seem to work because there are other independent justifications for legalization in each example : - guns can be used for sport , hunting , and defense , and gun ownership can discourage government tyranny or repel an invasion . - smoking weed is harmless and enjoyable . - women should be allowed autonomous rights over their own bodies , and an undeveloped fetus does not have sufficient medical or moral status to overrule the mother ’s decision to end a pregnancy . - prostitution ( when divorced from sex trafficking ) is a mutually beneficial exchange that harms no one , and it can provide a way for someone to earn a living who would have difficulty doing so otherwise . but for crimes that do n’t have independent justifications for legalization , the argument that they should be legalized because they will happen anyway makes no sense . for example : - if we outlaw arson , only outlaws will commit arson . - people will hire hit men no matter what , so it should be legal . if murder-for-hire is illegal , people will just hire assassins on the black market , which supports cartels and introduces them to criminal elements of society . - people will buy chemical weapons no matter what , so it should be legal . if buying chemical weapons is illegal , people will purchase them in unsafe conditions . buying chemical weapons should be legalized so that people who will buy them anyway can do so without risking their lives . - kidnapping and holding people for ransom will happen anyway , so it should be legal . if we make it legal , we could tax it and regulate it . the argument , ‘ x will happen anyway so x should be legal ’ is faulty because it ca n’t justify legalizing x unless you already agree that x should be legal . if x is something bad , then this argument makes no sense , because it endorses giving up on a problem , which will only make that problem worse . if x is not a problem , then it should n’t be illegal in the first place . since the argument only applies if you already think that x should be legal for unrelated reasons , and since it has no persuasive value if you think x should be illegal , it is n’t a useful argument ; it does n’t add anything . if x is bad enough to be a crime , then it makes no sense to legalize it just because people are willing to commit that crime . if you ’re okay with legalizing x just because people will do it no matter what , then x should n’t be illegal in the first place . if the test for whether a something should be legal were “ are people willing to do it even if it ’s illegal ? ” then every crime would be legal . so i suppose i will award a delta if you can provide an example where the "" people will do it anyway "" argument is dispositive ; i.e. , where people doing it anyway or not is the determining factor that makes the difference between whether something should be illegal or not .","people of all races and classes use marijuana , yet criminal enforcement of marijuana laws is disproportionately focused on minority communities . the widespread use of marijuana among all communities reflects an evolving consensus that it is n't really a problem requiring drastic intervention , but because the laws remain on the books in many communities , and because people in poor and/or minority communities are far more likely to have interactions with cops , it means huge numbers of people in these groups wind up in various phases of the criminal justice system for an activity that was n't at all unusual . we can fix this inequity by recognizing that if "" everyone is doing it , "" we have made a collective decision as a society that it is n't something that should be illegal . 1 : if you make something illegal and people still want to do it , the set of behavior around it will change . if one of the costs of banning something is that an underground market for it forms that enriches drug cartels or human traffickers , that is a real cost . you ca n’t eliminate the market or the behaviors associated with it , but you can reduce the chance that people get shot over it , or you can reduce the chance that people engage in risky behavior ( sharing needles , for instance ) by bringing it into the daylight . in other words , if legality does not effect use , it may nonetheless effect safety of use . 2 : in the case of guns ( or , say , nuclear weapons ) , you have two sets of people , those who would follow the anti-gun law and those who do n’t . if you make guns illegal , the set who would follow the law would not have guns and the set who would not follow the law would still have guns . if the latter set is also the one who does all the shootings and armed robberies , you might want other people to have guns for self defense against the lawless set . by making them illegal you give criminals a tool that law abiding people no longer have to defend themselves , when the whole purpose of banning the guns in the first place was to take them away from people who commit crimes with them . those people who commit crimes will be unaffected by the ban , while the people who they might then terrorize would now also be unarmed . in other words , legality may only prevent "" legitimate use "" and leave "" illegitimate use "" unaffected or , worse , more harmful . 3 : we make laws to reflect what we want our society to look like and to maintain order in line with our values . if lots of people want a thing , it ’s worth a second look at why it ’s illegal in the first place . if you banned breathing , we ’d all be felons because we care about living more than we care about the law . in other words , people wanting to do something is not value-neutral , and the fact that people want to do it enough to break the law is one of many factors we should consider in our policies . if nobody were to break the law regarding gun ownership , there would be no gun armed criminals , and you would likely have no benefit for armed populace . hunting , recreation , collectors etc - if they are willing to give up their weapons - that is , to not do it anyways - is a small price to avoid the massive toll gun violence causes . that nobody will do it once the law is the law vastly reduces the cost of compliance and future enforcement , while still providing all the benefits on the ' pro ' side of banning gun ownership . without people ' doing it anyways , ' the benefits may very well outweigh the costs of enacting and attempting to enforce the law . this is a contrived scenario , to be sure - as we ca n't guarantee a scenario where all would willingly just give up their guns , but it is illustrative of the costs society incurs when we expect non-compliance , and with some topics certain levels of expected popular compliance may indeed be the determining factor on putting a law on the books , much like total compliance could be for the gun ban issue . the issue with this argument is that arguing that it 's going to happen anyway is really trying to appeal to people to get them to make a reassessment of the actual damage that such a thing will do and whether it 's better to take the smaller amount of damage over the larger amount of damage . if the desire is to stop people doing things , and you can prove that either them doing so without legal permission leads to harmful side effects or that trying to suppress it has entirely failed , it is a perfectly valid argument . i think the issue is that people are n't backing that up with the statements that should back that up . guns is one where i think the argument that people will get guns anyway is kind of invalidated , because guns are a nonessential and largely undesirable thing ( aside from protection ( largely from other gun owners ) and hunting ( which is a nonessential , controllable activity and often disputed in desirability ) , and are therefore only going to be accessed by criminals . the fact that only criminals may want to get a gun is an argument that causes some dispute , but in other places the argument is followed up with "" but because of that most of the time most criminals do n't carry a gun around because they 're not expecting to have to be prepared for escalation "" . you can also demonstrably crack down on gun crime , too , and suicide rates are lower in a lot of countries where guns are not legal ( although this ca n't entirely be blamed on guns ) . there may be a lot of arguments for guns , but the suggestion that people will just seek out guns does n't play out . it 's suggested , for example , that rates of abortion do not go down where it 's illegal and there is active harm in allowing women to undergo the dangerous procedure . therefore there 's a fair argument that regardless of desirability , it 's better that it happens safely . and since it 's something that happens in desperate scenarios , most of the time , demand wo n't be shifted especially due to normalisation . it 's that it being illegal means many victims of trafficking end up considered criminal themselves because of the ways our laws work in the us . the answer here for example is making solicitation a crime but not prostitution ( therefore it 's a crime for the customer only ) , or legalizing it so it can be regulated . many people will say that countries with legalized prostitution have more trafficking victims-this is misleading , more victims come forward because they wo n't be prosecuted . but the issue is when i hear people talk about gun control ... they often have no idea of what regulations there already are , or any ideas of what exactly they mean by more control . like gun control , right now as it is we do n't have effective means for tracking gun ownership . with more strict background checks for example , not only do criminals still have them , but we do n't fix the large issues of people getting guns from dead relatives , friends , estate sales , or of children/teens using their parents legally owned guns . so ... instead of reject people will still do it anyways , rise to it . keeping track of where guns are and making people account for their guns annually , making everyone in a household go through a background check or a class , etc . a lot of people believe making bad things illegal will make bad things happen less . if you can persuade them that making it illegal wo n't make it happen less then you do n't have to persuade them it 's not bad to persuade them that it 's okay for bad things to be legal . it 's really hard to shake people in their beliefs that these "" bad "" things you list are not really "" bad "" so this rhetorical argument can be more effective . firstly , i think you slightly misunderstand the argument of "" people are going to do x anyway , so let 's legalize x. "" the argument is n't really "" people are going to do x anyway , so let 's legalize x , "" it 's "" x is bad , but making x illegal does n't prevent x and also causes y which is bad , therefore x being legal is a lesser evil than x being illegal . "" is really "" it 's not good for criminals to have guns , but banning guns does n't actually stop criminals from acquiring guns while also preventing law-abiding citizens who would n't commit crimes from having guns . is really "" weed is n't good for you , but banning weed does n't demonstrably affect how many people smoke while also [ de-legitimizing the rule of law in the eyes of minorities who are disproportionately criminalized by these laws , creating a black market which props up cartels which commit violent crimes , etc. ] and therefore legalizing weed is better than attempting to ban it , as banning weed causes more ills than simply allowing it does . is really "" a perfect world would have no abortions , but banning abortions does n't have any demonstrable effect on the number of abortions performed in a country while also risking the lives of women who resort to performing back-alley abortions . therefore , banning abortion is worse than allowing abortion because banning abortion does n't actually achieve it 's goal and causes more suffering than simply allowing it . is really "" prostitution is bad , but banning prostitution has no effect on the numbers of prostitutes in a country while also [ forcing the trade underground and risking the lives of the women working in sex work , promoting the spread of stis in sex work , making it impossible for the government to mitigate the damages of sex work ] . therefore , prostitution should be legalized because making it illegal does nothing to prevent prostitution and makes the matter even worse for sex workers and society at large . in your examples refuting this style of argument , the argument falls apart simply because you ignored the second condition of the argument : that the ban has to create an environment worse than before the ban . specifically , you use examples with many positive effects brought on by a ban of x. let 's break it down : this ignores that banning arson has the tangible benefit of protecting people from arson , as those who commit arson will be held accountable ( financially and criminally ) for the destruction of life and property they cost . this ignores that banning hit-men makes it easier for law enforcement to prevent hits before they happen by allowing law enforcement to find people attempting to hire hit men and charging them before real damage ( like death ) can occur . this also ignores that people who seek out hit men have already introduced themselves to the "" criminal "" elements of society in the sense that they are attempting to take another person 's life , so "" forcing "" them to interact with criminals to hire hit men has n't caused more harm than already exists before banning hit men . on the contrary , a ban in this case causes less harm , which is what renders the argument above moot : there is no "" y condition "" which makes a ban worse than legalization . this ignores that banning chemical weapons makes it easier to prevent terror attacks . society is not worse off with a ban on chemical weapons , so this does n't meet the "" y condition "" of the real argument than society is worse off with the ban . you attempt to meet this condition with the qualifier "" so people can get chemical weapons without risking their lives , "" but most people would say that a terrorist having to risk their life to commit a terror attack is better than a terrorist not having to risk their life to commit a terror attack , so it 's moot . this ignores , again , that the benefit of banning kidnapping and ransom is to protect people from being victimized . banning kidnapping and ransom allows law enforcement to send these people to jail where they ca n't hurt more people . this is a demonstrable benefit to the ban , not a "" y condition "" which makes a society with this ban worse off than a society where kidnapping and ransom is legal . in short , you 're misrepresenting the argument by ignoring the second half of it : the argument is not just that a ban is ineffective , but that this ban ends up causing additional harm to society making the ban quantitatively worse than legalization . when you take into account this "" y condition "" the argument is much more effective . the thing is ... arguing about the negative effects of making something illegal is a reasonable argument . however , it being illegal caused even more tremendous social problems due to the black market and the crime it created . you might call that an independent argument , but it actually only applies or makes sense if people are going to do it anyway . a lot of laws do n't make sense solely because of the social cost of the black markets that arise due to people doing it on a widespread basis even if illegal . if the rulers make a law and the people simply ignore the law , then the government has lost the consent of the people in so far as that law is concerned . so you should n’t make a law that people will just ignore . there will always be some people who reject certain laws and there will be people who accept laws that will seem bad in retrospect . the “ people are going to do it anyway ” argument points to the fact that having people breaking the law creates more bad effects than if the original action ( however damaging ) was simply allowed to continue . i think that while “ people are going to do it anyway ” may not always ( or even often ) be a good argument for legalising anything , its valid when used as an indication that there is a majority of people who desire to do that thing . if the majority of people in a society want to do something , there argument needs to look into is there a compelling reason not to allow it ? one difference between your examples is that in countries where abortion is illegal , it is more common , not less common , than in countries where abortion is legal ( making abortion illegal disempowers women , which leads to power dynamics that result in more unwanted pregnancy ) . in all of your other examples , illegality actually does reduce the chance of the thing happening . there is n’t really reason for nit to be illegal now things like arson ( destroying someone else ’s property/life ) murder/hiring ahoy man ( killing someone/conspiracy to kill someone ) does so basically as a contenting adult i should be able to do whatever i want to myself as long as i ’m not hurting anyone else . since bad guys will get guns anyways , guns should be legal so the good guys arent doomed to die . here it is arguing that guns should be legal for the benefit of those who wo n't commit crime . - my university is in a location where weed is illegal . as such , there are actual health concerns here - going to someone on campus for help with a friend who needs it but is high actually gets us in legal trouble , so people dont report problems ( including sexual assaults or other violent acts ) because of the risk of punishment . since people still smoke weed anyways , its safer to make it legal . - abortions are the same way . they 'll get them anyways , so at least if we make them legal they 'll be healthier for the patients . - legalizing prostitution is also for the benefit if the prostitutes . because it 's illegal , but happens anyways , we should make it legal so prostitutes can safely report problems without legal issues . basically , the point with these examples is that making it illegal does more than just make it illegal - it provides health and safety for the citizens who need it . they are not meant to be a measure of morality or what is right and wrong . they are fluid and are meant to change with the progression of society . but those other crimes are violent in nature . they hurt other people maliciously and therefore are not able to be applied in that arguement because they cause major harm . people are going to do opioid drugs and abuse them , but instead of spending money on a war we know does n't work , we should at least manage it so people can both get treatment and we can lower the cost of dealing with it . otherwise you 'll have to explain why we should pursue policies that are expense and even exacerbate the policy , instead of policies that reduce the cost and reduce the instances . and to note , legalizing something does n't always mean the same thing . everything starts as legal and then we have to pass a law to make it illegal . in my mind the only reason to make something illegal is if the net benefit was going to be positive . if we make something illegal and then afterwards we realized we messed up and its actually worse , we should change it back . the argument is n't "" x will happen anyway "" its which option has the best net result ."
9pm47h,"the united states is going through another gilded age . the gilded age in the us , for those who do n't know , was a time period that was characterized by rampant corruption in the government and big businesses , big businesses basically having total control over the federal government , anti-union sentiment , mass influx of immigrants getting paid poorly , a very strong economy , horrible environmental protection , and hyper-partisanship . & #x200b ; this is almost exactly what the us is going through at the moment . our congressman work for their highest donors and lobbyists , and once again , money and big corporations have nearly unlimited power in the federal government . millions of immigrants currently in the us are getting paid well below what is the federally accepted minimum wage in order for businesses to maximize profits . the republican party especially dislikes worker unions which force corporations to treat their workers fairly . the republican party also has dislike of the epa ( that they set up ) and a weird love of removing regulations set up to protect the environment . the hyper-partisanship of today also closely reflects that of the gilded age , with one party in bed with big corporations and another staunchly opposed to them .","the fact of the matter is there are millions of republicans . this is n’t because of corruption , businesses buying politicians , etc. it ’s because those republican voters are voting for republicans . the plaintiffs had to take their case to the scotus just to get an opportunity to challenge an epa ruling that their property constituted "" wetlands "" subject to the cwa . one seemingly small but important difference in perspective is that big business has n't "" taken over "" government . sometimes the business/government partnership gets so intertwined that the business is basically a wing of government . a lot of people like to point out that the federal reserve is a private institution . they also buy up treasuries so that politicians can spend into deficits that would n't be possible without this monetary monopoly . this process sucks spending power out of the dollars you and i are holding and gives it to the government and the politically connected big banks . a little bit less extreme of an example is regional cable companies or defense companies that constantly get new tax funded contracts . this is cronyism and it should be viewed as a partnership against us little people as opposed to business taking over poor little government because then we can see that the solution is not too give government more power to protect these big businesses . it 's called that because yes there were social problems but it was all hidden under a gold layer , the problems were "" gilded "" so people did n't worry about them . so the very fact that you 're being so open about our problems and all of these problems are problems people deal with and know about and many people want to work against prevent this from being another gilded age . this is n't a gilded age for the united states , it 's an age decadence for our civilization ( a civilization made of a coalition of unruly clans distinguished from one another by imaginary lines drawn in the sand as opposed to just one big entity ) . an age that started when we began to mass produce . when that happens we end up worrying about all that we are n't getting and lose focus on all that we are . greed corrupts and corruption happens at the individual level so of course it 's going to make it 's way into all aspects of society . question : if unions were more appreciated , and more ubiquitous , where would you guess the “ underpaid immigrants ” you spoke about would be working ? but , i guess you not , since the person who is taking the illegal wage is doing so because they are criminally employed to begin with . the republican party does n't hate unions because they force the evil corporations to treat workers well . oh boy , if there 's one thing we know conservatives hate , it 's workers getting treated fairly . then , the union takes this group of workers they hold under their thumb and they pressure the employer . it 's a big , corrupt , self interested , legally criminal mob . they steal from the company and the workers for their own benefit . they attack the company that created the job , that is providing the worker 's family with food and shelter . republicans are trying to check this criminal enterprise and protect those workers who have no voice . i disagree with some of your characterizations of the gilded age and the current state of politics . nonetheless , i would like to push that aside for now and focus on one key difference between now and the gilded age ... the gilded age in the us was characterized by some of the greatest and broadest wage gains in history . historical analogies like these are useful to the extent that they highlight particular trends in the present , like corruption , and suggest lessons we might learn from the past . there 's a lot that gets missed when we make an analogy . the political system was heavily tilted towards one , dominant party , as opposed to the back and forth pattern that 's characterized the us post-cold war . political machines -- no such patronage system exists in contemporary politics . all of these factors distinguished the gilded age from nowadays . i think you could just as easily say that "" the present is like the pre-civil war "" or "" the present is like the gilded age "" or the "" the present is like the roaring 20 's .

9pj4ol,"it 's better to have no freedom of speech than to be given the allusion of freedom of speech . \ \ i think it is better to live in a society where they straight up tell you that you have no freedom of speech than to live in a society where they give you the illusion of having it in the first place . the reason why i believe this is that i like to know the rules first upfront , i hate people changing the rules in the middle of the game . the simplest comparison i can come up with is that if i am walking and then i accidentally walk into someone 's property than i get arrested for trespassing . i rather they straight up hang signs that say i am entering private property in the first place . if i go my whole life believing i have free speech , then one day i get maced or tasered by a cop for speaking my mind . i would 've expressed my opinions in another way . these countries where they say you have freedom but on the other hand oppress you are not free countries nor are they honest countries . in my view , they are worse than an openly oppressive country .","in situation 1 ) , at least the people know now where the boundaries are . tl ; dr : the illusion can be broken by the exercise of the supposed freedom of speech , therefore breaking the illusion . in a society where the government gives the illusion of free speech , they would have to work to keep up that illusion . in other words , they would have to pick and choose when to crack down on speech because if they always cracked down then it would be quickly obvious that there is no free speech and the illusion dissipates . if so , can you clarify by providing an example of what you mean or where you feel that an example of a restriction on free speech that should not be ? it 's unclear what you 're specifically referring to when you talk about "" freedom of speech "" , "" no freedom of speech "" , and "" illusion of freedom of speech .

9pdsxq,"the u.s. military and the defense industry is the largest and most useless ( and dangerous ) makework program in history . more than just the "" military industrial complex "" that gen. eisenhower warned us of , the military post-vietnam , post-draft era has really become a way for the rich and those in congress ( increasingly the same people ) to artificially lower the unemployment rate ; redistribute tax dollars to both shareholders of defense contractors and to marginalized citizens who might otherwise be unemployable ; and essentially operate a political slush fund to support the economy in places with shipyards and bomb factories but precious little else in the way of industry and employment . i recognize that this argument is likely to anger people who have made a lifelong commitment to selfless public service in the armed forces , but numbers are numbers : president trump asked for a 10 % increase in fy 2018 to $ 639 billion . the congress eventually obliged with an 18 % bump to $ 696 billion . our military budget is more than the next seven nations combined budgets , per the pete peterson foundation . like our healthcare system , we spend outrageously and for what ? safety ? global order ? respect ? are any of these actually ours at all , thanks to borrowed ( at interest ) and then spent billions ? tl ; dr : our economy is addicted to spending tax dollars we borrow to finance a war machine nobody needs . like a third-world nation that refuses to regulate transit or mining or logging because it creates low-paying jobs for millions , our vaunted military is really a catch-all for many young men and women who might otherwise be doing nothing at all . change my view .","you might disagree with the method of the us roaming and the ideology it is operating by , but striving to export what you think is right and good for the world is worth it . why do the communists in the us love communists like che guevara , even though he never operated in the us ?

9pcwg8,if the goal is to liberalize and secularize countries like egypt and saudi arabia the west should not rush to isolate but rather slowly push them that way . i have a hard time understanding what people think isolating countries egypt and saudi arabia for massacres and assassinations will accomplish . i think it 's much more likely that these countries will turn into radical islamic strongholds at even greater level than people think they are now if the west aims to economically isolate them . i find it nearly impossible to see them turning into secular liberal democracies from economic sanctions and international isolation . on some level i would like to envision them as finding the same path to democracy as south korea . even though for a long time after the korean war south korea was basically a military dictatorship or a sham democracy countries like the united states continued to use their influence to support democratic liberalization . obviously south korea is still not perfect but to get to where it is from where it was imo was in part because of western liberal influence . if say the united states had moved to isolate south korea after it committed atrocities against it own people i think south korea would have had a harder time liberalizing . even in a country like tunisia where liberalism did find some success from the arab spring we can see islamist parties gaining huge amounts of support . in egypt after their little experiment with democracy we saw islamist parties gain huge amounts of support . admittedly . . i am probably ignorant on south korea 's path to democracy as well as details about what went on in egypt and tunisia during the arab spring . feel free to provide me with any knowledge you think in should have .,in the failing country the people get agitated and then the populace can demand the change . if the goal is to liberalize and secularize countries like egypt and ksa then we should promote democracy first . it is immoral to support dictatorships that then enforce social change . we can work with them but most importantly it would be wrong to impose sweeping societal change with policies that are n’t supported by majorities in the respective countries .
9pbqzk,"the us should continue to support mbs even if he did order the murder of khashoggi so i believe that mohammed bin salman is genuinely working towards implementing wester reforms in saudi arabia , and most importantly , working to move the nation away from wahhabism to a much more moderate and worldwide acceptable form of islam . his reforms are very controversial , but he has cracked down on extremism and corruption in his country and led a move to his country , and islam in general , out of the dark ages . not only do i think his movement to modernize and bring more western reform to saudi arabia are beneficial to us interest in the long run , but i think we know very little about the reality of the situation surrounding khashoggi , like his ties to the muslim brotherhood and turkey 's increasing hardline and militant muslim leader , or the culture of saudi arabia , where the death penalty still exists for offenses such as homosexuality , adultery , and blasphemy . i personally think the media is making such a big deal of it because of the close ties with the trump administration , and trying to tie the situation to trump as a way of promoting their belief that trump is anti-journalism . to change my view you must demonstrate that mohammed bin salman is indeed bad for us/saudi and more generally muslim relations and that we should be meddling in the internal affairs , that have no bearing or affect on the us , of another independent nation","i 'm also going to assume that you 're correct that mbs is genuinely working toward positive social reforms in saudi arabia . there 's an enormous combination of actions the united states could take to express its displeasure with the murder of khashoggi , while remaining saudi arabia 's - and mbs 's - ally . the beauty of diplomacy is that america can precisely measure the amount of punishment it dishes out to fit ( i ) how serious it finds the offence , ( ii ) how valuable it considers saudi arabia as an ally , and ( iii ) how valuable it considers mbs as leader of saudi arabia . for example , america could cut off its logistical support for the war in yemen and cancel the recent arms sales to saudi arabia , then arrange for a high-level meeting between mbs and the president following which mbs expresses regret at khashoggi 's death , and the united states reinstates the arms deal ( but not the logistical support for the yemen war ) . this would have the effect of strongly expressing to saudi arabia that the states does n't want this sort of thing happening again , while reinforcing that the states wishes to see mbs remain saudi arabia 's leader by allowing him access to the white house ( considered a big privilege for a foreign leader ) , and the opportunity to win back the arms deal . the murder of jamal khashoggi is part of the ongoing conflict between turkey and saudi arabia re : the muslim brotherhood . i 'm sorry , regardless of khashoggi 's sketchy history , the world does need to know and hear about that stuff . this would be a great reason to question him , which is something we can not do as a result of of being murdered . you 're forgetting we already support saudi arabia in major ways . our continued support of saudi arabia despite their past actions has hurt our ability to form relations in the middle east . nobody wants to work with us while we 're supplying the bombs saudi arabia is dropping on them . by continuing this involvement even in light of the most recent revelation of saudi arabia executing journalists , we are setting an awful example for the world , that executing journalists is perfectly fine . would n't the extra-judicial killing of a critical journalist be a clear sign that mbs is n't in fact , working towards the very reforms that you mention ? most of the weapons being used by saudi arabia are american made ."
9pblci,"the teenager who baked her grandfather 's ashes into cookies did not commit a crime . so i saw this bonkers story being linked , and one thing that stood out to me was this paragraph : > [ police lt. ] doroshov said police opened a case and have been trying to determine which penal code would apply to baking human remains into food . officers considered a california penal code section regarding the disposal of human remains in an improper manner but public-nuisance charges might be more appropriate , he said . i do not think it is appropriate to try to hunt for a crime like this . the conduct is very weird and gross , but unless something is clearly a crime , the police should not go around trying to find some tortured interpretation of a criminal statute to make it a crime . so cmv and show me a part of the california penal code that her conduct violates .","it is illegal to feed other people things that are potentially dangerous without their knowledge and consent . it is illegal to consume humans , even if they have been reduced to ash . do you think it should be legal to bake human remains into cookies and feed it to other people without them knowing ? perhaps not a crime , but she could be sued for intentionally causing emotional distress by both the unwitting consumers of the cookies and the relatives . there are states that have begun making it a criminal offense , but i do n't think ca is one of them ."
9pb1fp,"elizabeth warren 's decision to release her dna results , and the way in which they were released , was both strategically and morally wrong there are two components to my argument . first , i believe that releasing the results , in the manner that she did , will strategically/politically hurt her chances in 2020 . it makes it look like she is stooping to trump 's level : by playing ball with trump , she has taken the bait and is now stooping to his level of ad hominem politics . it gives the right a ton of ammo for attack adds and talking points . they can now say that warren has benefited from her claim of native american heritage while being scarcely native american - this fits very well into the right wing narrative that democrats are obsessed with ' identity politics ' and fetishize minorities ( i 'm not saying this is True necessarily , but warren 's actions fit neatly into that narrative ) . the questionable morality of the entire thing will make many advocates for social justice , as well as native americans themselves , second guess whether warren would be a genuine advocate for the oppressed or whether she is merely riding this wave for political gain which will significantly reduce the votes she would otherwise get if she kept silent on the issue or released a more appropriate video . second , i believe the way in which she has sold her native american ancestry is morally wrong . in her release video , she claims that the dna results validate her native american heritage . however , in the past , warren has gone even further than saying she has native american heritage - she has claimed that she is native american . this is a big distinction , and to claim that you are native american when you are likely less than 1 % native american , have never had tribal contact , and have never suffered any form of oppression that actual native americans suffer , comes off to me as overplaying a minority status for political gain . native americans themselves object to the use of dna tests to validate ancestry - the whole idea ( to them ) is demeaning and ignores the fact that culture and shared experience are much more important than dna in terms of native american ( or any cultural ) identity . by ignoring this opinion from native americans , warren is tone deaf at best and at worst is knowingly acting against their wishes by going so public with her results . how should warren have proceeded ? i believe that she could have publicized her results without coming off as offensive and culturally incompetent . she could have used the video to honestly explain that her family had hyperbolized her native american roots , that she does not identify as native american , and that she has not been oppressed in any way because of her ancestry . this has been a rambling post , but i think ya 'll get my major points . & #x200b ; & #x200b ; "" in an interview with the globe published last month , warren explained that she identified herself as native american in the late 1980s and early 1990s as many of the matriarchs of her family were dying and she began to feel that her family stories and history were becoming lost . ivy league universities , like the ones where warren taught , were under great pressure to show they had diverse staffs . the university of pennsylvania filled out a document explaining why it hired a white woman over minority candidates — clear evidence it did n’t view her as a native american addition . and the globe interviewed 31 harvard law school faculty members who voted on her appointment there , and all said her heritage was not a factor . "" so , while i do n't think it 's likely that her career has been significantly furthered by claims to native american heritage , the fact is that she has identified as native american historically . i believe that she should have addressed this in her video and been explicit that it was a mistake to ever identify as native american . also , before you comment , i would strongly recommend reading the two articles i have linked as they provide most of the information you need to know .","i was surprised first i heard she released the dna report . the narrative of him refusing to pay the bet will hurt him more than she playing the identity card . multiple members of her family on her maternal side were registered native americans and her parents told her they eloped because her paternal side of the family did not like that her mom was part cherokee/delaware . native americans groups have been on every side of the issue because they agree it 's also hard to verify native ancestry by the paper trail as well , but do n't want members of their tribe kicked out over dna tests which elizabeth warren has said she is against . there 's no way to prove this now , but she 's playing the long game . by the time 2020 rolls around , no one will really remember the cultural upheaval this reveal caused . they 'll only remember that her dna test showed that she has a native american ancestor somewhere in her bloodline . tell us about that in the comments , not in topline posts . my only argument is that the only way to shut someone up who keeps saying something 's not True is to just go ahead and give them proof since you have it . why allow him to keep spewing bullshit when you could just shut him up while simultaneously calling him out on his promise to donate . are you saying you would n't release your dna results to someone saying you are n't the race you are and promising to donate 1 million dollars to charity if you are actually that ethnicity ? and all you have to do is get those results so they 'll shut up and also donate 1 million dollars ? i agree playing ball with this guy is n't necessarily the best decision but it 's either that or sit there while they throw the ball at you over and over . you said that being less than 1 % native means you have not come into contact with native tribes ( which is not necessarily True ) or experienced maltreatment because of her native ancestry . you also said that many natives disagree with using dna tests as a measuring stick for what constitutes native . let us say that being < 1 % native necessarily means that you have not come into contact with native tribes , lived with them , experienced the culture , experienced prejudice or maltreatmenr , and native people disagree with you using that test as a way to justify identity . i honestly just see it as a thing where she released her dna test just to give a chance to a charity getting $ 1 million . it is fallacious to make the claim that she is stooping to their level when republicans wo n't even rise up and have some courtesy and decency as statesmen . i do n't see that as being any different from an american claiming they 're irish because their great grandfather was from cork , something that happens a lot , especially around st patrick 's day . maybe politically it was a mistake but identifying as your ancestry , no matter how tiny that percentage might be , is an american tradition . has elizabeth warren ever been the primary person responsible for bringing up her claims of native ancestry in a political context ? as far as i am aware , she has always done this in response to someone pushing her on it . this does n't strike me as the behavior of someone looking to play "" ... on her minority status for political gain , "" as you say . this whole business about releasing her dna results , in fact , can be considered a response to a direct challenge by scott brown a couple years back . scott brown , as you may remember , was a major player in the original iteration of this whole controversy some eight years ago during warren 's original run for us senate against brown . finally , i want to challenge the notion that she has "" ... never suffered any oppression that actual native americans suffer . "" first , she is an actual native american , both in terms of family lore ( not under question ) , and now due to result of her genetic background . that she is not registered with a tribe is a separate issue from her self-identifying as having native ancestry . second , her lived experiences and her family stories have shown that she was brought up in a lower middle-class upbringing , and that she did indeed face hardships as a teenager . a further point is that , whatever your opinion of it , affirmative action is not just meant to help a person out because of their direct struggles -- it is also meant as a means to rectify generations of past disadvantages suffered by one 's whole family . it can take generations for a family to come out of poverty , for example , and to the extent this issue ( or similar issues ) faced warren 's family , then even if she had used her native ancestry for political gain ( which i do not think she did , but that 's a separate question ) , then that still may have been appropriate i do n't know if you 're still following this , but my view is that this was a good move strategically because it gets the issue out of the way now so that it 's old news by the time she runs for president in 2020 . i think that her heritage would have to be addressed at some point , and it would look bad whenever it happened . if she did n't take the test , then the questions would follow her and the rw media would focus on that exclusively , painting her as a lying cultural appropriator ( what a leftist thing for them to say ) . if she waited till then to take the test , all the negative response you 're seeing would be happening much closer to the election , which would lose her votes . taking the test now gives her a solid rebuttal to those who claim she 's lying , and it gets the inevitable negative press out of the way long before it could hurt her chances . it would be bad no matter what , and she screwed herself over 20 years ago by claiming na heritage in the first place , but not taking the test would be even worse , so it was best for her to get it out of the way now and finish the story so that it 's old news well before her campaign . i am not sure what game the dems are playing but they seem incompetent at this point . i do n't understand why she ca n't be native american even if she 's 1 % and if some native americans do n't like the way she has gone about proving it . and i mean what percentage point do you need to be native american or black or mexican ancestry to be apart of that group , and if shared experience is important and someone had no opportunity to access those shared experiences , like you got murdered as an infant , would you not be native american , or what would happen if you got murdered and were only 49 percent native american there is almost no way you could be native american , people just emotionally ca n't handle white people who feel related to oppressed minority groups , she has a right to feel this way , white people are allowed to be confused too , and she has a right to announce it any way she wants . t rump made the challenge for her to do so in a very public way after trying to ridicule her heritage for months . his public announcement also included his indicating he would donate a million dollars to her choice of charity if she did so . to announce in public her choice of charity ( so there is no way he could say he had n't paid up because she never told him which one ) made it imperative that she make the announcement in public . i 'll hit the first point last and start with the moral aspect of releasing her dna results . due to genetics , i do n't look like i have any mexican blood in me , but it 's there . now we have a bet and in order to validate it , i have to take a dna test . the results of the dna test prove i 'm mexican . that 's different than saying she has the native american heritage box checked on a tax form . one is essentially saying she "" sympathizes and understands the hardship native americans had to endure over their history "" while the other is more of a statement of fact "" my grandmother 10 generations ago was native american "" . so who 's to say her native american ancestor was 100 % native american . now , how the native americans view dna tests is subject to opinion as well . they believe the True indication of a native american is their commitment to the tribe . but that does n't mean they frown on dna tests , they have their own standards for enrolling in the tribe legally . it 's too low . but they themselves have dna tests to validate for legal purposes . understandably , the main indicator of a person 's ancestry is the passing along of the culture . she was just saying she has family that was native american . so for her to make a claim , and be challenged to provide proof , and then step up and provide that proof , show 's that at the very least , she 's not lying . ultimately , if she runs or not is irrelevant since the presidential election is n't won via the popular vote . if the republicans are removed from those key positions , then whoever 's running for the democratic party should win , unless it 's hilary , cause then people just wo n't vote again . it would still happen i 'm sure but something needs to change . you have to understand the target audience for the message she was doctor ford , no wait , she was brett kavanaugh , she was being accused of lying and trump and all the republicans talking about her for the past 4 years called her pochantus and made fun of her for not taking a dna test , she 'd said on record i did n't ask my parents for proof , she said on record i did n't know how much heriatage i had . to those people , her skipping a dna test was as suspicious as brett not wanting the fbi to talk to mike judge . so she takes the dna test , and it says she 's got some ancestry ( not much , but it exists ) so she makes the fact squad , drums it up and gets it out now so it 'll be a done deal come post-november then cheeroke nations swoops in and says , does n't matter what your dna test says you 're not a citizen.as if she was trying to say that in the first place , completely missing the mark . everyone sadly isnt paying attention to the fact that the country is split 50/50 left or right , bowever independents are the ones who win you elections , this will hurt the democratic party , it supports the identity poltics bs . that article means she first began discussing her native heritage in the late 80s/early 90s . first , warren never tried to leverage her native american ancestry . it was the right wing media that immediately grabbed it to attempt to ridicule her ( since she is obviously not native american ) trump jumped on that and played it over and over and over again in his rallys . so she got tested and her percentage of native american ancestry is roughly what she had originally claimed ( one grandparent ? she still never claimed to be na or that her ancestry makes her more suitable for public office . that does n't mean this needs to be uncivil , but you seem genuinely interested . firstly , this does fit directly into our narrative , but we are n't the authors of this narrative , we feel as though we just point out the obvious . regardless of if she knew how legitimate her claims were , she used her "" heritage "" as a tool . we can never prove , nor disprove , the benefit she may have been given from her use of her "" heritage "" , but we do know that she has never been subject to any form of oppression stemming from it . i think the main strategic advantage of warren ’s decision is that it disarms one of trump ’s primary avenues of attack , name calling . all comments that earned deltas ( from op or other users ) are listed [ here ] ( / r/deltalog/comments / 9pl186/deltas second , neither you nor someone with more na dna gets to gatekeep what constitutes “ enough ” dna to make the claim . by her families story it ’s more likely she has 1/32 or 1/64 na dna as well as marriage documentation . there ’s literally a chief of a major tribe with 1/32 na dna . we literally have politicians with ties to the kkk and neo-nazis , a pedophile ran for senate , the most corrupt administration and political party in our nations history and your worried about the optics of a woman sharing her families story and challenging the president to keep his word and donate $ 1mil to a charity of her choosing ? morally , the only thing she did wrong was check a box identifying as native american in a directory of law teachers . there 's no evidence she tried to use this status to her financial benefit , to help her career , or that she identified as native american in any other situation . she claims she did it in hopes that she might connect with other people of native american descent , since she knew it was part of her family history and wanted to learn more . as someone with experience in genetic genealogy , i would say her dna results do in fact validate her native american heritage . the report shows she very likely had a native american ancestor 6-10 generations back . you might be thinking that 's pretty far removed , but hear me out . when this whole thing popped up during warren 's senate campaign , she talked about how her family always told her they were part native american . genealogists started digging and discovered that warren 's great great great grandmother was allegedly native american ( her name was o.c. sarah smith ) . there was no solid proof , but it seems to be a common claim passed down among this woman 's descendants . if this ancestor was full blooded , that would make warren 1/32nd native american . however , genealogists seem to agree that she was n't full blooded . if this ancestor was half native american , that would make warren 1/64th native american , which would mean warren is 6 generations removed from a full blooded native american ancestor . this fits with the dna test , so it 's totally plausible this ancestor ( warren 's 3x great grandmother ) was half native american . a great great great grandmother is not as far removed as you might think . one of my great great grandmothers was still alive when i was born - i even have a picture of her holding me as a baby ! i know all about this side of the family , because she lived so long . this is only one generation less than warren 's supposed native american ancestor , so it 's not unrealistic at all that the family might still be well aware of their heritage , and consider it to be a significant part of their identity . there would be physical traits , stories passed down , names ... all of it eventually dwindling away generation by generation , but they still held onto the identity . just like many native americans who assimilated into european-american society , warren 's ancestors left no paper trail . it was n't until relatively recently that it became acceptable or desirable to claim native american ancestry . there are tons of families just like warren 's , who do n't have it documented , but know through oral tradition . you can put all kinds of political spin on it , but it 's hard to deny there 's something amazing about dna backing up oral family history from at least 6 generations ago , and that 's the main thing i take away from this whole issue . it 's True that warren is mostly of european descent , but at no point did warren lie about this . nothing she said has been proven wrong or even misleading ... if anything , it 's all been reinforced by dna evidence . on the other hand , strategically i would agree with you . republicans do n't care about facts or science . they will build their own narrative , and warren is just fanning the flames by responding at all . the only thing she , maybe , could have done differently was that she could have just given trump the results and insisted he give the $ 1m to the charity . after all , he did say he 'd do it if the agreed to take the test , not based on publicly releasing the results of the test . she just should have take the loss and dont comment about it , must probable scenario is that she got the results , saw the indian heritage and says yes , consults with her people ( which i doubt contained some actual indian ) and everyone says "" yes drump is finished "" , media releases that she is in fact cherokee or whatever but the people dont buy it and then is downhill from there , check reddit post where they are supporting her for saying she is cherokee , the is no correct way of saying she is 1/2020 cherokee dude at that point the error margin comes in to the picture as well as scandals from this companies tainting the results . i might add that the cherokee tribe does not accept anyone who ’s not a direct descendant of a person on the dawes roll , none of miss warren ’s ancestors have turned up on the roll , so she can not claim citizen status ( also her being 1/1024 is probably a flaw on the dna ’s testing , they are not accurate at determining native heritage , and the category belongs to natives throughout the two continents of south and north america with no clear distinction . the gain she will get from standing up to trump 's lie that he would donate $ 1 million to charity if her tests showed native ancestry far outweigh any of the negatives . not only for herself , but for other democrats running in the mid-terms , since obviously that 's what drives her timing on this announcement , rather than any personal gain she might get 2 years from now . the value of this stunt for trump comes from undermining her credibility by painting her as a benefactor of identity politics , and insinuating that she does n't deserve her position for reasons other than affirmative action . by ignoring this , she plays into the narrative that she 's saying what gets her elected . she wo n't even back up the claim that she 's a native american . so now she can be spun as someone whose only credibility comes from identity politics , when she does n't even "" deserve "" that credibility . i think showing that she is even less “ native american ” than the average american just puts her comments in an even more racist tone than they originally needed to be . saying that her parents needed to elope to be married because one of them was “ too native american ” when they would still be at best average . saying that she knows they were native american because of the high cheek bones ... warren says she has heritage , president says "" ill donate $ 1m if its proven "" , warren proves it and the president balks denying he ever said it . she has done more for native americans than the majority of white ppl . i have other more recent family members from italy but this specific italian man taught his son how to do certain things , they ’d eat certain things and speak italian . now i do n’t go claiming italian citizenship ( although i could because of my maternal family ) but that italian man influenced his son and his son my grandfather and my grandfather my dad and me . ew is not claiming to belong to the cherokee , or trying to claim to be a poc or a minority but it is disrespectful to deny her ancestry and her family history . trump offered her $ 1m to a charity of her choice if she took a dna test and it proved she had native american dna . the people who are upset about that issue are basically saying she should be more native american than she was . and how the hell can this reasoning only apply to warren but not to the countless lies trump told about his own background ? i do n't think she did anything wrong , trump is using her to enlarge himself in his supporters eyes continually by distorting a True story about her family that she told . i think that sometimes she may have abbreviated the term , but she never claimed to be native american any more than by heritage . she has been pretty clear i think that her belief was based on the family story that her grandmother had native american heritage , not even native american herself . she never made any type of tribal claim at all . the statement by the cherokee nation secretary of state mainly just reiterated their stance that dna testing is not grounds for admittance into a tribe . it ultimately can not be used that way because we do not have the resolution on genetic maps to differentiate one tribe from another . this is why he specifically objects to "" using a dna test to lay claim to any connection to the cherokee nation or any tribal nation "" , not the idea generally of native american ancestry being tested . nowhere in that statement does chuck hoskin jr. say that the test is demeaning . the statement is a legal response to try to head off the possibility that loads of people start trying to claim membership in specific tribes based on dna tests . the question whether natives ( or anyone else for that matter ) are offended or not by ew dna testing is irrelevant to her searching for proof to her ancestry . the test more or less validated her actual claim ( great-great-great-grandmother being native american , ) and she never actually claimed to be oppressed because of it , nor did she ever receive preferential treatment because of it ( confirmed by employers . ) it 's not an issue of playing ball with trump or not , but providing transparent information about the issue . since warren 's ancestry is in question , taking a dna test and releasing it provides more information about the issue . the fact that trump had promised to donate $ 1 million to a native american womens ' sexual assault suvivors charity and wo n't , is just another way to call attention to his lies and hypocrisy . but that was n't the main reason for releasing her dna . no one believes that she 's 1/2 or 1/4 or more native american - if she had any native american ancestry , it was clearly going to be a very small fraction . the only question was whether she had no native american ancestry , or a very small fraction . the latter supports her claims , and the former would invalidate it . the dna shows the latter , so it supports her claims . i agree that if she identified as native american , that was factually wrong . however , even if it was morally wrong , it was a wrong committed 20 years ago and can not be taken back . it has nothing to do with her decision to release her dna results last week , which is the subject of your cmv . also , since the time she identified as native american , she was not in politics ( and would not be for 20 years ) , she ca n't be said to want to politically benefit from it . your final point assumes that native americans have a monolithic opinion , which is rather a racist view in itself . the eastern band of cherokee indians supports the way warren has used her dna test . they say : "" senator warren has demonstrated her respect for tribal sovereignty and is an ally of the eastern band . as such , we support her and other allies – regardless of party – who promote tribal sovereignty , tribal self-determination , and protection of cherokee women . ” what she does not plan to run for president ? this move will galvanize her into a loud anti trump figure and both raise her profile in the current mood of the left and also provide cover for other dems . with all that energy wasted on her from the right , imagine how the rest of the pool can capitalize on that.kamala harris is running , i believe and this whole set up is perfect for her , cuz the right will be busy attacking the wrong woman . \ > it gives the right a ton of ammo for attack adds and talking points . they can now say that warren has benefited from her claim of native american heritage while being scarcely native american we 're weeks into this thing and no one has shown that harvard even has an affirmative action

9pa925,"the issue of abortion , from a morality standpoint , has nothing to do with “ a woman ’s body ” i would like to preface this argument by saying i am very pro choice , but i think the discussion around abortion gets distracted , and neither side of the argument actually addresses what the other side is saying . those who oppose abortion believe that a fetus is in fact a living human being , so it has the right to live . if everyone agreed that a fetus was in fact a human being , then everyone would oppose abortion . my question is , when did this discussion become about the physical body in which the living being was living ? if a fetus is considered a human being , its right to live surely should not be decided by the person to whom it ’s living inside , right ? the entire argument is whether or not a fetus has rights . if the fetus does in fact have rights to live , then it is no longer the right of the woman carrying that fetus to decide its fate . it ’s physical location should not affect the moral argument . the discussion should only be about when life begins . i believe it is a woman ’s choice to abort a fetus inside of her because the fetus is not a living human being , and therefore she has the right to abort it . but , if i did believe it was a living being , then it would have nothing to do with the fact that the fetus is living inside of the woman . does anyone disagree ?","this argument is framed around the idea of absolute body autonomy . the fetus is 100 % dependent on the parent and is a net negative to the women 's body . if said women wants to remove the fetus , then she should be allowed to . the negative outcome to the fetus does not factor into the right of the woman for autonomy of her body . the same logical line of thought which prevents the state for forcing organ donation . i do n't personally like abortion but i am 100 % committed to the concept of near absolute body autonomy . the abortion debate is unsolvable and at some level just dumb , like people fighting forever about how handle car accidents , before even first teaching everyone to wear seat belts and take drivers ed ! so now we have an issue of conflicting rights , the child or the woman . which side you fall on would depend on which violation of a right you see as the most egregious , ending non-sentient life before it fully develops , or forcing a free citizen into slavery . i agree that fetus is a human being , yet i do n't oppose abortion . even if we assume fetus to be a full grown human being writing poetry with 100 % of all right 's of the mother . it all falls down if you simply disagree that fetus is n't a human , since we do n't have an objective definition of a human being . so your point will be ignored by people who simply disagree with you . that is why abortion supporters generally value bodily autonomy argument more , because whether a fetus is a human or not is irrelevant . so , hypothetically , say you were hooked up to another human being , in some way where your body was being used to support theirs . is it morally permissible for you to disconnect yourself , even if a person will die as a result of your actions ? if you hit someone with your car , and they needed blood , no one could force you to give the blood even though you caused the accident because it 's unethical . it is the right of the woman because it 's inside her . if the fetus was living out in some cave and not affecting the life/health of someone else , then sure let the fetus live . fun fact : the average woman loses 500 ml or 2 cups of blood during childbirth . also , the way that i see it is that if something/someone is causing you physical pain , you have the right to do whatever it takes to get them to stop and protect yourself . if someone tied you down and pulled out a knife and caused you as much physical pain as childbirth does , along with cutting up your genitals , you 'd be allowed to do whatever it takes to get them to stop even if it means murder . the fetus is costing the pregnant woman her health , her mobility and a nontrivial risk of mortality . it is justified to abort even if the fetus is regarded as a human life . my right to life does n't even mean i can take your kidney from you even if you are no longer using it because you 're dead ! the reason that people discuss it as being about a womans body is because they 're talking about whether or not a womans right to her bodily autonomy beats out the fetus . the pro choice side argues that it does , because every persons bodily autonomy should win ."
9p9yol,"people should be judged for the entire platform of a candidate or party they support . there seems to be a common refrain that because no candidate or party perfectly represents a given person 's views , that person can vote for them and then disclaim the portions of the platform they disagree with and try to avoid being judged for that . for example , a republican being a member of and voting for a party which explicitly wants to overturn obergefell and end the federal protection for gay marriage , thus allowing states to again discriminate and ban homosexuals from marrying . ( nb : that 's actually in their platform ) such a republican , when pressed on acting in opposition to gay marriage and getting criticism for that choice , is likely to say "" there 's no perfect choice , and i had to prioritize . i only voted for them because of the economy , i personally support gay marriage , you can only judge me for what i believe in , not what the party does . "" this logic can be summarized pretty simply : "" i am only responsible for the consequences of my support which i desired , if i did n't desire that particular thing i 'm not responsible even if i knew that was the consequence . "" not just that someone is n't responsible for things they do n't do intentionally , but not responsible for the outcomes of their intentional actions unless they also wanted them . that logic is completely farkakte . nowhere else in life do we accept the idea that i can know the consequences of a choice , do it anyway , and then claim that i 'm not responsible for the consequences i did n't "" want . "" if i told someone "" well since there 's no perfect food which is as tasty as a mcdonald 's cheeseburger , but also good for me , i chose to eat mcdonald 's , but that does n't mean i 'm responsible for getting fat , i did n't want to get fat , i just wanted to eat delicious food and i had to prioritize "" i 'd get eye-rolls . if i said "" i 'm not responsible for being poor just because i stopped going to work so i could play video games . i knew i 'd lose my job and stop being paid , but i only wanted the good part where i do n't have to work and can play video games , i did n't want to be broke "" i 'd garner guffaws . but , for some reason , in any political conversation someone will feel justified in saying "" sure i knew this candidate stood for some bad stuff , but i did n't want the bad stuff , i only wanted the good stuff , so you ca n't judge me for supporting him . "" this is wrong . the lack of a perfect choice does not exculpate us from responsibility for the choices we do make . when voting for a candidate or party , we are supporting their entire agenda whether we agree with the entire thing or not , because we are trying to put them in a position to act on the entire agenda . our support does not exist a la carte , and we can be judged on the basis of the entire platform our actions help to support . cmv . p.s : just as a request , please do n't make this about fptp voting systems or the number of parties . even in proportional representational systems , the same choice of "" i do n't agree with everything this candidate/party stands for "" is made .","of course they still bear responsibility for the issues they do n't support but if we 're going to judge a person based on those issues , we have to acknowledge the context in which their decision was made . by saying that you do n't support a certain view of a candidate who you voted for , you 're not denying responsibility so much as saying that in your view that issue is not a high priority . in these scenarios , the people making a choice to prioritize are not wrong because they prioritized . if someone chose to prioritize being healthy over eating food that tastes good or chose to prioritize going to work over video games , they would n't be judged harshly because they prioritized well . basically , it does n't make sense to judge a person based on each individual issue the candidate they voted for supports . they should be judged based on how well they prioritized the entire set of issues . based on your view , the only way you could successfully vote for a politician is if you run and vote for yourself . anything less , in any voting scheme means you are making compromises with your value system . people vote for candidates who best support their prioritized interests . unfortunately , there is never a candidate who meets all of your interests so you are compromising on who you vote for . people voted for bad politicians because the core ideas they care about aligned with that person . if you wanted to ensure a textualist/originalist scotus nominee for scalia 's replacement , trump is the only choice . if that is extremely important to you , then to advance your personal interests , you have to vote for trump . your position sounds more like the desire to ostracize people for voting for a candidate who holds specific positions you do n't like . it seems like you want to project that candidates views , in there entirety , to the individual voter and hold them accountable as if they held those views . i vote for the candidate who will advance the political views i have and feel are most important . i have extremely limited choices so i will choose the one that fits the best . i further accept there are positions this person holds that i do n't hold . i just do n't give those lesser views the same priority as the deciding views . the core political views that are make or break for a candidate . it does not matter what other positions a person holds , if it is against the top ' make or break ' position ( s ) , it is a yes/no for a candidate . vote for the person who holds the key positions i want , ignoring the lesser positions i may disagree with or not voting . in practice that means voting for a person you do not agree with on lesser positions . a person should not be judged for the entire platform of a candidate they voted for . they should be judged only on their prioritized list of political views that led them to choose a candidate . tom usually votes for moderate republicans and disagrees with most democratic party platform positions . both voted for clinton in the last election . they each cast their vote for wildly different reasons , but your standard has no interest in intention . both are judged based on the label of clinton supporter in your book . there may be individuals , in both partys , with whom i more closely agree but if i just judge them on the party then i can not warrant voting for either . what if i vote for a certain party , because i agree with most of what they 're saying , then lobby them to change their stance on certain issues i do n't agree with ? my voice is actually stronger to change their stance on something because they know i am one of their voters , as opposed to someone who wo n't vote for them . eating only bad food has essentially two consequences -- you 'll get fat and unhealthy . not going to work has essentially one consequence -- you get fired . this is nothing like voting for a candidate or party with a platform consisting of 100 issue , 90 of which you may agree on . particularly when the alternatives are to not vote , throw away your vote , or vote for the party you agree even less with . people want to be engaged in the process , so they make the best possible choice , which is usually to vote for a party they only mostly agree with . for example , i think cars are good . they have made people more mobile , they have made it so people can live outside cities , people can travel , people can get places faster , they 've helped the economy . they also pollute and cause deaths . does this mean i want the environment to be bad and people to die in car crashes just because i take the position that cars are an overall good ? what if you are pro gay marriage and your only two choices are : is there a difference between someone who voted for a candidate despite disagreeing with some of their positions vs someone who voted for their candidate specifically to prevent the opposition . for example , you have citizen 1 who voted for hillary because they agreed with her tax policy , but did n’t support her foreign policy . citizen 2 disagrees with all of hillary ’s platform , but votes for her because they find trumps even worse . now , knowing that this is how the system works , we are forced to vote for people that best match our values and policy positions . but these politicians have agency ; they know that there are only a finite set of people against whom they have to compete to get elected . so , they stake out policy positions in the hopes of appealing to a wide array of voters . the structure of this system means that it is the politicians themselves who are at least partly to blame for a "" bad "" position , because they have actively chosen that position . in this way , voters can at least be partly absolved from some poor policy stances that a candidate has , because we are operating in this imperfect system where the politicians themselves have a say in the matter . person a hates someone and plans to viciously murder them and then excecutss the plan correctly . that person is not understanding the context so they looking at one little part in isolation is super unhelpful at best . it 's not necessarily the case ( and often is n't ) that voters vote for platforms . voting can be pragmatic and self-interested and need not be an endorsement . there 's no significant , broadly applicable reason for one to judge in the unnuanced , ham-fisted manner proposed by op . op does n't seem to have any coherent theory of "" responsibility .

9p5o9z,"pushing the "" racism = prejudice + power "" definition hurts any conversation on racism thus has no conversational utiltiy and should be dropped . a major talking point in some leftwing social circles is the social redefinition of racism . growing up racism was always "" discrimination based on race "" with "" systemic racism "" and "" institutional racism "" being greater tiers that only the group in power could wield . it allowed for a simple distinction between "" i hate white people "" and "" we are going to prevent black people from opening businesses "" while keeping the racial factor in the open . & #x200b ; i remember my little sister trying to explain to me the concept of racism only being a power thing back in 2005 or 2006 ( when she was in college ) and while she was initially convinced to a degree my protestations helped change her mind to the uselessness of such a distinction ... and then i went about 8 years before i began noticing it creeping into everyday discourse . & #x200b ; but now every conversation i see ( online mostly but also a couple times in my personal experiences ) has at least one person bring up "" well black people ca n't be racist because ... "" which instead of enlightening everyone and opening eyes it just closes the entire conversation , or worse it derails it into a debate on what "" racism "" is . & #x200b ; it is also often used as a gotcha or a conversation terminating weapon so the wielder can walk away with their heads up high while getting pats on the back from their cohorts and advancing nothing . & #x200b ; i 've decided back in the day and i feel it more strongly now that "" racism = prejudice + power "" has no conversational utility for one and secondly it is n't even an internally consistent distinction as many who try and wield that definition will , in the next sentence , talk about how racist asian and latino communities are towards black people in the usa . & #x200b ; ignoring the contradictions i 've seen , i have concluded that even if you personally strongly believe "" racism = prejudice + power "" it has zero conversational utility and is a poor tool to use in any discussion on race and racism . & #x200b ;","the reason why it 's a sticking point is that people are deliberately trying to shift the focus of the discussion . many people ( it seems you are one of them ) really , really want to think about racism as something that exists in people 's hearts . there 's two reasons for this , i think : one is that certain types of people ( many of whom tend to not be on the left ) much prefer thinking of things in terms of individuals ... that 's just what makes sense to them , and it 's where they normally go . the other reason is , despite any given person 's best efforts , it really is just very easy to get yourself off the hook when you talk about racism this way . it sets a low and unhelpful standard : as long as you , personally , do n't go around denying black people jobs , then hooray , everything 's fine . because of this , people often are talking about two different things . that is , someone can be trying to say , "" the system is set up to favor white people and remaining ignorant of that is a problem , "" and you 're hearing , "" you , as an individual , are morally culpable for black people 's higher levels of unemployment . "" it holds utility in that it means white people ca n't pull the race card . would it be fair to say that the racism = prejudice + power definition repels you because saying something like , ' minorities ca n't be racist ' is essentially excusing prejudicial behavior in minorities ? in other words , do you feel that when people use this definition to say that yelling "" white people all deserve to die ! "" if so , i think curing this implicit assumption might make you more open to using the new definition . you can do this by either imputing the position , "" you ca n't be racist against white people , but you can be prejudiced against white people , and that 's bad , "" to the person you 're talking to . do n't assume they think that prejudice of any kind is okay - just assume that they 're making a semantic point , not excusing bad behavior . if you 're not able to just assume this , then ask them directly . if they condemn all prejudice , then you can continue the discussion using the more nuanced modern definition of racism . if they condone prejudice against people in power , i.e. , it 's okay to be racist against white people , then you can move the discussion to that issue instead ; either way , the term can still be useful , and approaching it this way will probably remove most of your objections . i do n't have an answer to your separate point , that we already have a term for this ( institutional racism ) so there 's no reason to make up new words and redefine old ones , but if that 's your only remaining contention , i would say that your position has partially shifted from where you started . power on the other hand , is a different beast , and something that r =p + p reveals when looking past the americentric white black dichotomy . in america we treat racism as the worst form of prejudice because of america 's ugly history of slavery and segregation that badly harms black people in the present . to me , it 's the stripping of the history that harms conversational utility of the term . by way of example , there 's a reasonable debate to be had about whether "" black lives matter "" is a good approach to improving race relations in america . and one can not possibly address the question of why it 's reasonable to think that black lives matter is not racist but white lives matter is racist without the history/power part of the term . i ’d probably go the whole distance and say that conversations about the definition of racism in general have zero utility . power can amplify racism as we have seen throughout history but it is suspect to make the claim that it is a fundamental aspect of racism by definition . when i hear this definition it is very clear that the person is indirectly referring to the racism of white people . it is also used to exempt people without power from the label . when people argue for the definition of racism minus power they are often trying to flatten racism into something natural that all people are capable of in the same way . many of the indisputable severe examples of racism throughout history have also been extreme abuses of power . the holocaust , the transatlantic slave trade , jim crow segregation are more complex than the definition minus power suggests . investigating how power modifies racism can be important in understanding the broader implications of racist thinking beyond the actions of the individual person in isolation . using power to make broad assumptions about the racist nature of all white people is pointless but this does n’t mean that we should underestimate , ignore , or oversimplify the impact power can have on racism . i think people on both sides cherry-pick statistics and events to make it seem like its a widespread problem ( i.e. immigrant crime for gop or police shootings for dems ) . if someone is confused about what type of racism you are talking about , you can easily just clarify you are talking about institutional racism not individual racism . this usually completely solves the problem , unless you are talking to someone who does n't think institutional racism . you refer to ' converational utility ' and ' advancing the conversation ' and denigrate people who use a ' conversation ender ' to walk away from the conversation without progressing it . and the protests of many people who are challenged by such discussion . thing to keep in mind is , people shut down when challenged . some people , such as your sister , are clearly able to engage in discussion and discourse . some people have the maturity to discuss what sort of powers are at play , what forms prejudice comes in , and how different things factor into socio-equations . the reality is that prejudice and power is the only way to discuss racism . if you dumb it down to simple prejudice , it does not tell us how it plays out , it does n't tell us what power people have , it does n't even scratch the surface . but academia , a world where people routinely discuss the equation of prejudice and power , exists because there is far more than just the gist to discuss . "" guitar "" might exclusively mean "" a wooden acoustic instrument with six strings of gut or nylon originating in spain "" in a conversation about romantic-era music ; that does n't mean that the aforementioned definition is the only valid definition of the word , but it is the only valid definition in that context . similarly , "" racism "" with the definition you 've provided has conversational utility in a sociological context where it 's understood by all conversation participants that "" racism "" is being used as shorthand for "" institutional racism . "" ( but yeah , i think it 's pointless to push this definition as the only valid definition when it 's clear that others are using the word in the colloquial sense . ) what if people were to explicitly acknowledge that there is both a professional/scientific use ( power + prejudice ) and a non-professional/colloquial use ( any racial prejudice ) of the term racism , and use both terms in different contexts/situations ?"
9p4q3e,"the death/disappearance of jamal khashoggi should not matter to america . jamal khashoggi , a saudi national , is believed to be dead , presumably at the hands of saudi agents after they abducted him in the saudi consulate in turkey . khashoggi lived in the u.s. since 2017 , but was not a citizen . he was abducted and killed by the saudi government while not on u.s. soil . saudi arabia is a repressive theocratic monarchy that kills people for adultery and witchcraft . that they would kill a political dissident is not particularly surprising . saudi arabia is also a strategic regional partner of the u.s. despite being a repressive state . they are the devil we know , and our trade and security ties with saudi arabia run deep . my view is that the american government should not react to this killing . it has no effect on the u.s. , khashoggi was not a u.s. citizen , he was not abducted or killed in the u.s . this has nothing to do with us , and now trump and saudi arabia are threatening a trade war over it . sure , we 're supposed to be a beacon of freedom and democracy to the rest of the world , but the murder of one man is not that important in the global scheme of things . to change my view , you 'll need to assert why this murder is a major geo-political shift that puts american interests in jeopardy .","it 's fashionable in some circles to hate the press these days , but a free press is one of the things that defines a free society , and it is worth sanding up for . he was a reporter at a us media outlet killed for his reporting . khashoggi 's murder matters more than others because he was a washington post columnist , a permanent resident of the united states , and because the killing happened outside saudi arabia , in that order . assuming for the sake of your post that the saudi regime did n't intend for the world to know that it was responsible for the murder , it still made an accidental statement that it considers it acceptable to murder permanent residents of america who write opinions for major american news organizations , outside of saudi arabia . if the united states does nothing , then people who fit that description are now perceived as not protected by the american state , and it 's now open season . similarly , america benefits when it is perceived to be able to protect those who are close to it , and as a permanent resident of the united states and a writer for a major american publication , khashoggi qualifies , even if he does n't merit the same ferocity of response that america would extend if he was a citizen . to make a very crude analogy , for saudi arabia to murder someone like khashoggi with so little subtlety is the equivalent of a small-time crook murdering a guy who runs a pawn shop on a street controlled by a powerful gang in broad daylight . it 's an affront to the powerful gang that someone would brazenly employ violence against a person in their territory without their permission , whether the pawn shop owner paid protection money or not . if it goes unpunished it makes others on that street wonder who 's really in charge , and the powerful gang loses face . it ’s bad enough when they are killing their own citizens in their own countries , but when russia starts poisoning people in britain or saudi arabia starts killing people in turkey , i think it ’s a bigger problem . eventually , someone might try something like that in the us , and it ’ll be an even bigger deal . i think it makes sense to come out strongly against these sorts of things now , before it starts spilling over into more regions of the world , and eventually into the us . there is room to argue that different countries with different moral ad political traditions should have different laws ; some of us outlaw the death penalty , some of us behead people in soccer stadiums . there is a fundamental difference between what you do within you borders and what you do in another country , and there is a basic level of respect that must be paid to diplomatic norms . on a purely practical note , it matters very much who authorized this murder . if he did , the reformist image he 's presented to the world is bullshit . if he did n't authorize it , someone other than the king of saudi arabia is directing the intelligence services and royal guard - that is very significant when it comes to our strategic partnership . the turks ( also our allies ) are enraged because they see this as a murder of a dissident on their soil . every other regime in the region will look to our response to determine just what they can get away with - can they murder dissidents without consequence , or will stepping out of line cost dearly ? if we do nothing , it will become clear that saudi arabia ( and to a lesser extent , our other arab allies ) have carte blanche to murder as necessary . america must react to this killing because we are the primary supporters and enablers of the saudi regime ."

9p3st0,"having children is unethical a child can not consent to be born . the newly born person is vulnerable to all sorts of suffering , and creating such a sentience would mean subjecting it to the suffering ( with 100 % certainty at some point of life ) . not creating a new sentience , spares it suffering ( good thing ) but also pleasure . however , unborn person can not know that he is missing pleasure , therefore it does n't cause any suffering or distress to him . so : creating sentience means gambling with its potential alive state in which it could suffer , not creating sentience is neutral since unborn person does n't know he is missing anything . aside from this asymmetry , consent is absolutely fundamental and if someone can not obtain it , he should n't force anyone to anything , simple as that . & #x200b ; \ [ edit \ ] : before anyone starts explaining that unborn entity can not either consent , please read this below and address it as my argument , potentially write why you do n't agree with this . unborn person can not give consent because he is n't alive , however in frame where he is alive , he can express dissatisfaction that he could n't consent to his own life . that 's why i take the frame of consent for ' already existing ' situation . a person that is unborn and wo n't be ever born , will also never know that he could miss anything from life . if the opposite were True , we would be denying life to infinite amount of lives . but it 's not the case , since those people do n't exist in the first place . this is the basic asymmetry between existing-frame and non-existing-frame . & #x200b ; & #x200b ;","the whole premise of denying a child life because it does n't yet exist and can not consent to being born is flawed . an animal that has been abused its entire life can not consent to being freed from its abuser . after all , freeing it might result in it dying in a kennel , or facing worse abuse later . i have a feeling that , despite that chance , the majority of people ( possibly yourself included ) would choose to free that animal . it is the same with the unborn child , why should you deny the child life just because it might possibly suffer in the future . also , if choosing to not have a child is sparing it from suffering , then it would logically follow that it would also be denying the child future happiness . you argue that a child not yet conceived would not know what they would be missing in life , and therefore can not be denied happiness . then you can not save an unborn child from suffering either , as they would be just as incapable of comprehending suffering as they would be of comprehending happiness . the world at large has no concept of consent and neither does an unborn child . outside of human society consent has never been fundamental for life . to conceive a child is to create a consciousness that did not exist , it does not force a pre-existing consciousness from a state of "" unborn "" to "" born "" . setting that aside , the weakness in your argument is that you state "" consent is absolutely fundamental "" as if we should take that for granted . taken to the extreme , every human action could mean subjecting someone , somewhere to some type of suffering indirectly . despite suffering and other negative influences in life , human happiness is actually fairly stable , because of this phenomenon observed in humans called hedonic adaptation : >> hedonic adaptation is the observed tendency of humans to quickly return to a relatively stable level of happiness despite major positive or negative events or life changes . >> generally , hedonic adaptation involves a happiness "" set point "" , whereby humans generally maintain a constant level of happiness throughout their lives , despite events that occur in their environment . so even if children will experience some amount of suffering , it will largely not affect their overall happiness throughout their lives . therefore , the potential of suffering does not make for a good case against having children . consent requires a consent giver , a consent taker , and a specific time at which the consent is determined . at the time of the sexual act , the zygote does not exist . and fertilization itself is entirely up to natural processes and literally outside of the couple 's control . all they can do is try to bring about the circumstances that are most beneficial to the conception of new life and hope for the best , but ( outside of a lab ) no one can create life at will . one leaves them ( unborn child ) the choice to be or remain alive and the other deprives them of such a choice . imagine a vast unbodied pool of souls , and each one can choose whether or not to be born into a body . ( think of it in part like the relationship between dreams and waking life : most people do not remember "" reality "" when they dream , but sometimes remember dreams after they wake . it 's an imperfect analogy in terms of consent , but deals with the issue of not remembering our pre-birth existence and choices while we live . ) you ca n't prove that souls do not exist before birth , and you ca n't prove a lack of consent to being born . you come across an unconscious person on the street , they appear to have hit their head and are bleeding . besides , if it kills it ’s self , that ’s the ultimate expression of consent . do you think it would be unethical to save someone from drowning because if they survive there ’s a chance they might experience pain ? a person who is unborn can not give consent because they are not alive , but they have the ability to retract consent ( i.e. commit suicide ) . we make decisions for people all the time that we think are best when they can not consent , like making decisions for incapacitated people in hospitals . we try to make a decision that will result in the best combination of minimized suffering and maximized enjoyment and accept that there is a risk that we may not have made the right choice ."
9p3ppr,"i am not ashamed to get financial aid to pay for my college schooling even though i am not doing well academically . someone posed the argument that i should be ashamed that i am wasting tax payer 's money by failing some of my classes . i am not excelling academically but i am still trying to get ahead in life . anyways , i am a tax payer so i pay income , sales , and whatever taxes an u.s citizen would pay . i feel like if i added up all the taxes i have paid overall , i pretty much have enough to pay for my tuition at my school . so i am not ashamed to get financial aid for schooling even though i am not doing well in my classes since i am a tax payer myself . i should feel that i am taking other people 's money .","i struggle to say that shame is appropriate , but it does seem like if you are regularly doing poorly that it may be an indication that you are missing either the aptitude or the necessary interest to benefit from this investment , so you may be ' wasting ' your own and the financial aid investment . grades are a form of feedback and so as the student , is can be very useful to take that feedback into consideration and benefit from it rather than being dismissive just because it is negative . that said , maybe your area of study is a necessary component of a career path that is otherwise a very good fit for you , or there is some other reason such as cultural differences or life circumstances that leads you to struggle in the academic setting at this time . you have to weigh all of the information you are given along with grading or feedback from professors and professionals in your field , so blanket statements such as saying supporting all students with poor grades is a waste of financial aid money are unfair , but i think an individuals ' defense to this kind of treatment should rely on a better argument than that you also pay tax dollars in order to be compelling on a personal level . even if you did pay for all of your schooling through taxes , you 're still occupying a slot that could be used by someone in a worse situation than you who could pass their classes . your taxes dont just go for school funding , they pay for every other state and federal budget item in some way . for you to be paying enough taxes to directly fund your schooling you would have to pay such a huge ammont of taxes that you would n't care about the cost of college . just because you pay taxes does n't mean you should feel justified wasting the money and time the program is giving you to help you succeed . including you talking about all of the connections you are making through your extracurricular activities . lets assume that you spend the next 4/5 years and coast through college and barely get a degree . your "" friend "" would realize that if they worked with you , they would have to work harder then you . let 's say one of your really good friends at school goes into the energy industry . your friend is super smart and focused in school and landed a nice job a energy company a and you ask him if he can help you get a foot in the door . it does n't work that way no matter how good of a friend you think you have because your friend will have to put their reputation on the line . this is why i say regret is the emotion you should be worried about . i doubt your taxes even come close to paying for your tuition . plus , keep in mind that there were/are/will always be people out there who do n't want you to get the financial assistance you 're getting . broadcasting a lack of appreciation or non-effort is just going to give people like that more ammunition to cut aid for other kids down the road for the studious and slackers alike . universities foot the bill for different amounts depending on the kid and school . so you ’re wasting your schools money too that they invested in you ."
9p3ow1,"partisan gridlock is a permanent and inherent feature of american politics , and nothing we can do will change it , short of changing the constitution it seems that since at least the 80 's , we 've been stuck in a state of permanent partisan gridlock , and only when there are large majorities of either party and/or all branches of government are controlled by one party can substantial work be done . so i believe that only if we change our system of government , to something where compromise is necessary and encouraged ( how exactly , i do n't know ) can we end the partisanship we see today . how am i wrong , and what can we do to change things without totally changing government ?","encourage the candidates to stay in dc and interact with each other on the weekends . bring back the congressional research agency . this was a non-partisan research agency that advised congress about the state of the nation and the possible effects of policy in the same way the goa advises on tax policy . when it was defunded , congress had to start relying on lobbyists a lot more and that led us to the current "" my facts vs your facts "" environment . laws should not be that easy to pass , but the current extreme gridlock has definable causes and can be reduced by eliminating those underlying causes . well if it 's really only been this way "" since the '80s "" ( and i do n't know if that 's True -- first we 'd have to agree to an objective way of quantifying "" gridlock "" ) , then does n't that prove automatically that we can solve the problem without changing the constitution , because we could go back to doing things the way we did them before the '80s , when the constitution was the same ( at least in the respects we 're talking about ) ? one thing might be require congressmen to live in dc instead of running home every weekend ( which is a new practice ) . we as a country need non partisan voters to show up to the polls at every level of election . i do n't mean we need more of this or that group , or who they should vote for at each level of government , just people increasing the number of votes cast . exit polls , and voting statistics matter to politicians who won the election . if the winner ( on either side of the spectrum ) begins to see a trend that their constituents ( the ones who showed up and voted ) are overall more diverse in their political leanings they will begin to hedge their bets on political decisions . hypothetical example : i 'm a politician that won an election that used to be won by double digit margins in favor of my political party , and now those margins are shrinking to single digit . if those margins shrank because of undecided voters i have to appeal to a larger base in order to have a hope of reelection next time . if those margins shrank because of voter turnout in the opposing political party , i have to become more moderate and cross the aisle from time to time so that a future opponent can not differentiate themselves from my policies enough to mount a significant campaign of opposition . if the voter turnout is overwhelmingly the far left/right partisans then the sitting elected officials have to kowtow to those people and their policy desires in order to ensure their continued support against an opposing figure atop the opponents partisan group . my house member is expected to win his seat by 30 points ( 20 pt margin of error ) . i could stay home and nothing would change , or i can vote my displeasure and believe that if his expected 30 pt win is only 15 pts that he might work harder to represent more of his varied constituents . it is posible that it would drive him farther right in order to get out the vote among the die hard partisans , but that is self defeating in the long run for all the reasons you allude to in why you feel like the gridlock is permanent . partisan gridlock at the national level is a result of the two-party winner-takes-all system currently in place . if the states modified their processes for electing senators and house members to something like single transferable vote ( or literally any system that guarantees a condorcet winner ) , the likelihood of a third party ( and a fourth , fifth , etc ) getting elected to national government would rise dramatically . with multiple parties in government , coalition governments become necessary , which tends to further streamline things by introducing more potential tiebreaker or swing votes ."
9p2yjz,"the us two party system is > 80 % caused by just 2 factors . plurality voting and national elections i often see the claim that money , or elites , or the media , or rules about ballot access , or debate access or the two parties themselves are the reason we have a two party system in this country . i disagree . these things may benefit from the system , and thus work to sustain it ( though less than most give them credit for , but in terms of benefit and the effort they expend to sustain it ) , but they do not cause it , and if we changed all of them , reduced the power of parties to set rules , opened up ballot access and allowed debates between all people on the ballot , eliminated money in politics ( somehow ) and required media to give equal time to every candidate who achieves ballot access , we would still have a two party dominated system . this is for the very simple reason of duverger 's law . if there are more than two candidates in an election , and you can only pick one to support , the risk of vote splitting means the fewer candidates similar to you ( r chosen candidate ) are running , the more likely you are to win . so parties would still find ways of indicating which of their candidates should be supported , and voters would still go along with it , and success would breed imitation , until we had only two real candidates running in each election . there are countries with plurality voting and more than two parties though . as far as i know , every one of them is a parliamentary system . this means that there are no regular nationwide elections to organize the ideologies behind one of two candidates . instead , there can be regional parties , or smaller parties that only compete in districts that in the us would be considered "" safe "" . if one of the major national parties is completely incapable of competing there , then it becomes safe for a smaller party to run , and since there are n't national elections , voters are less likely to consider themselves aligned with one party against the other . the results however are much the same , with two coalitions rather than two big tent parties , and typically only a very small "" centrist "" party , if there 's one at all . the only True fix , therefore , is to change the calculus for voters , give them the option to express their True preference among multiple options in every election . this means two interrelated things . the first is a voting system that allows either ranking or rating all the candidates ( rating seems to do better theoretically , though ranking systems have been around longer and are in use in more places so it 's hard to compare the two based on real world evidence ) the other is proportional representation . in the us proportional representation at the federal level is very difficult , so i propose pushing for star voting at the local level to test out the concept , and familiarize voters with it before finding a way to enact it at the federal level . so my basic claims are this . - plurality voting only functions with two options . - nation-wide elections push the entire system towards those two options coming from the same two parties everywhere in the nation . - changing this system means changing how we vote , preferably to star voting .","the current system means that if we have an issue with how our reps are elected , then we need our reps to change it . it is n't necessarily a direct cause of the specific problem of 2 party systems . but 2 party systems are n't the only possible problem an election system can have . instead of thinking of the 2 party system as the root problem , we need to think of it as a symptom , as one of many possible presentations of the broader problem of giving elected officials the power to entrench themselves . election reform without election reform-reform , if such a thing is even possible , is a bandaid fix . here 's the dirty secret : most systems are "" two party systems . "" you have libertarian conservatives and the religious right and the free market conservatives and the moderate establishment movement republicans and neoconservatives and blue dog democrats and "" corporate "" democrats and the environmentalist left and the labor left and the berniecrats and the progressives . the difference between the united states and other countries is that we consolidate our blocs in the early going of the voting/electoral process . instead of electing individual parties from all of those groups , we have those battles in the primaries , and consolidate behind one person who best represents a given constituency for a given area . we have tons of options , we just filter them out earlier in the process . from what i understand , most countries that have successful multiparty systems are just as much national elections ( if not more so ) as the us . however , our differences there might stem from a different concept of what makes a national election . i do n't know about you , but in just about every election i 've voted in , i 've had choices other than democrat or republican . what we have are two particular political parties who are better at getting support than the other parties . if a team begins to win more , it attracts higher level players and more fans and donors . which makes other teams difficult to compete . this is why for example , in college football , you have "" dynasties "" ( even though there are rules against money in amateur football , it 's still there ) . in the nfl you have a form of socialism via the draft system that "" redistributes the wealth "" ( player talent ) every year , which compensates for this effect , which makes all the teams more competitive . and the parties that have more money and resources are the ones who end up winning , and that 's a cycle that 's hard to stop once it begins . ( although in fairness , one party , the republicans is becoming much more resource-rich than all the others due to their support for corporate interests over the people ) . so in reality , we may end up with more of a "" one-party system "" in the future : the corporate party . it 's also a myth that a "" third party "" would make a difference . any party that becomes viable will begin to attract special interest money and change to represent the will of their benefactors . it just so happens , in america , one party has decided to represent the faction of people who have the most money , so there 's no need to spread it elsewhere . there 's no reason the election for president should change all the other elections . other than that one election , it 's the same as the uk and canada , both of whom have fptp and both of whom have multiple major parties . so too , for that matter , does the philippines , which does have both national elections for president and fptp and has many parties in its congress ."
9p2c2s,"i do n’t think it ’s an unfair consequence to detain and desperate families illegally crossing into the us i understand that in the past , most families would be deported and this current system is draining more resources . my issue is that families crossing the border know there are consequences and they still knowingly put their children in danger . the outrage that this has sparked in mainstream media ( driven largely by celebrities , social media influencers , or news outlets ) is one sided in my opinion . i would never cross illegally if the consequences involved my daughter being separated from either parent . yet , people are continuing to cross , and the general public is advocating for easement on punishments . i believe there should be tough consequences , especially if you know it ’s illegal and risks your family staying together . i understand why people are trying to get into america . i understand keeping children segregated and in warehouses is not ideal , but i do n’t think it ’s an unfair consequence . i ’ve been struggling to understand a valid and logical argument for the other side . please change my view on why it is an unfair consequence to seperate families . second edit : both my parents immigrated from asia ( separately before meeting ) and it was a slow process , but they managed to do it legally . they now are both american citizens . my husband is an immigrant from europe . i am canadian .","when someone commits an illegal action , it is not okay to punish their children . almost everyone agrees on this , and i 'm happy to ignore the people who do n't . this gets contentious for children post-puberty , but pre-puberty nearly everyone agrees on this . from these three things , while we can conclude that it 's okay to punish people who illegally cross the border , it is not okay to punish their children . also , trump 's actions are actually even worse , since these people ( who entered illegally ) are applying for asylum . here 's a surprise : we 're not allowed to separate families of asylum seekers . between punishing children for the crimes of their parents and violating international law , i 'd say i have every reason to be angry at trump for this . you do n't put a kid in jail for a crime their parents committed . children do n't have the agency to say "" no i want to stay in mexico/wherever because it 's illegal to cross the border "" . if the government were putting kids in nice facilities with access to their parents who are awaiting trial , there would be less outrage . i do n't think we should be separating families in general , but this administration has chosen the worst possible way to do it by putting young children in heinous living conditions while separated from their parents . tbqh nothing in your post actually touches on the fairness of the consequence , it just amounts to "" we say we 'll do x if you do y , thus if you do y it will be fair of us to do x. "" which does n't really show a commitment to fairness ( which usually relates to justice or proportionality ) , so much as a commitment to following through on a threat to do something unfair . like if a cop says to you , "" if you jaywalk i 'll kill you "" before killing you for jaywalking , that does n't make your unjustifiable murder "" fair "" , simply pre-meditated and thus doubly horrifying . perhaps you could say "" we warned you "" and be correct but to call it "" fair "" simply because you warned them does n't really make sense . your only justification you gave for being fair is that they laid out the punishment in advance , which even before we get to the fact that they may not know about that , does n't seem like a good criteria for a punishment being "" fair "" . if you cross the border without an immigration visa , that 's what most people think of as illegal boarder crossing . but if you are crossing for asylum , you actually have time after the crossing to submit the petition . but if you separate the children at the boarder , you deny people the ability to submit a petition and follow the law . i think the most relevant argument is that illegal immigration is not only a victimless crime , but actually benefits the country ( more people = more people to trade with , and illegal immigrants actually commit crimes at a lower rate than the native-born population ) . [ data shows ] ( -- url -- + administration + targeted + immigrants + traveling + with + children + government + data + shows ) that the trump administration policies specifically targeted adults who were traveling with children for prosecution : in may , 9,200 adults were prosecuted , of which many with children . yet of the roughly 40,000 adults who crossed the border that month , 24,300 were without children . this means that they could have easily selected and prosecuted the same number of adults , while entirely avoiding locking up any children . heck , they could have prosecuted even more adults if they had used the resources used on processing children , to prosecute more adults . this demonstrates that locking up children is n't merely some unfortunate/unavoidable consequence of the policy . whether you believe that the parents should have acted differently does not change that it was unfair for the government to specifically target families in the first place . you absolutely would if the consequences of staying meant your daughter was going to be murdered or raped . it 's not a fair consequence because , first , it 's abusive to separate young children from their families , and second , it 's not being done in the interest of justice . i thought we were n't supposed to imprison children for the crimes their parents commit . i imagine your view might be very different if we start doing this to people who jaywalk , for example . the families crossing the border are committing misdemeanors for which they they will probably not be charged . then imagine someone trying to justify that by saying the parents knew it would happen . would your view change if someone was able to convince you that even though they were fully aware that their children might be separated from them , they decided it 's still less dangerous for their kids than where they are coming from ?"
9p1oc2,"governments should make changes in a scientific modular way , instead of applying them to a whole nation at once [ long ] to some extent , each new law passed by government , can be viewed like an experiment . if a law increases a school 's budget , you can collect statistics regarding the student 's performance before and after the change , and judge whether the grades significantly improved with the new budget . without a control group and replication however , this kind of experiment becomes somewhat of junk science . just because a school happened to improve , does n't mean that the increased funding was the main cause . the school might have gotten a new management , or some other change that caused the improvement . instead of doing "" science "" people end up having general philosophical representations of what probably works and what probably does n't . due to the lack of hard science , people are forced to judge based on ideology instead of actual experience . a lot of time is spent arguing about what 's the correct way to fix a problem , instead of trying out multiple methods to discover what actually works . the biggest problem , of course is that research and political simulations are expensive . decisions frequently need to be made without sufficient research to back them up . however , i feel like governments passed laws in more scientific way : any time there is a new law , instead of applying it to a whole nation , the law should only apply to one small area - one average sized city for example . all other land area can be considered the "" control group "" . after some time , the law can then be applied to another city . preferably a very different type of city , to see if the effect will be affected by region . continue doing this for several more cities . rerunning the experiment , in another city , can be considered as scientific replication . keep on comparing the control group cities to the experiment cities , and see if there is any noticeable effect . if there is a positive effect , slowly continue applying the change to all cities , until it becomes a nation-wide standard . if there is a negative effect , stop the experiment early , or switch up which cities get tested on . if you get mixed results , undo the law in certain areas and see if there was an effect . try and identify if some regional feature is causing the mixed results . i feel applying any law this modular format , will allow us to do "" real science "" in a political setting , and ultimately answer , "" does this work or not ? "" without having to back down to philosophical ideologies . --- there are obviously a few issues with this kind of government , but i feel they can be resolved given enough thought . > how do you decide which cities should get this law passed first ? if my child gets a lower iq because of your school experiment in my city with a law that failed , was n't that unethical ? there will definitely be poor results from some experiments that some cities will experience . this is inevitable , however it is very useful scientifically . if a government realizes that a law has unintended negative effects on a city , it be considered a good thing that we stopped the law early and did n't apply it to the whole nation at once . if it 's a significantly controversial law , you can try the following : the first cities that get tested on , might be ones that voted most highly to try it out . > would n't a wealthy entity be able to skew the results to look positive for some experiment ? for a few cities , absolutely . however i feel , as you increase the number of cities that are being experimented on , the amount of funding to skew the results in all locations , will be diluted . potentially for some experiments that can have placebos , we can make the experiment blind , ie not announce to the public which cities are currently being experimented on . only release the results when the experiment is over . > wo n't this make passing laws take way too long ? i feel if we replace our current ongoing government debates , with ongoing experiments , we 'd eventually get a lot more done . some laws will have immediate results . if the effect is positive , we 'd apply these laws to all cities relatively quickly . if some laws take a long time to have any effect , we can ask whether or not it 's worth it to have the law at all . hence we might end up minimizing the amount of laws , which would be a good thing . --- you can probably come up with other issues with this kind of government , but do n't they seem resolvable to you ? does n't this sound better than have people endlessly argue , without getting anything done ? i feel like this science based form of governance can really excel over the ideology based nations , and will take a lot of the stress and guesswork out of politics . cmv .","there are so many variables that it would be difficult to control for everything besides change in budget . but like i said in point 1 - we already have imperfect results . you make an assumption that good government is the one that produces an the most scientifically efficient society . you can argue that good government ( in a democracy ) is the one that most accurately reflects the will of the people . for example , if we somehow scientifically prove that the optimal school budget is x , should we get change the school budget to x if it means taxes go up to 80 % of income ? there are certainly people who will feel that the biggest role of government is to protect our individual freedoms , even if that means allowing us to act against our own interest . finally , given the points above , do you have any evidence that a science based society would be on the whole better . as someone who clearly values science , i would assume you would first advocate for experimentation on whether a science-based policy is better than a majority rule based party . there are arguments that collective thinking can produce as effective ( and in some cases more effective ) results than the scientific method . and even if it is worse , but close , we would still have to analyze the cost of implementing the science system versus the additional benefit . your idea is perfectly logical and does n’t seem half bad , however there are several underlying assumptions , mainly in that the government prioritises solving problems above all else . governments in reality are not perfectly efficient and have other goals in mind . often they seek to appeal to the masses , which is especially applicable in democratic countries . having a “ control group ” can be seen as giving that group special privileges by those outside that group and those inside ( depending on the situation ) will be suspicious as to why they ’re “ test subjects ” of the experiment . such projects only sow discord between groups of people and results in a dip in popularity for politicians . politicians have to decide on who gets special treatment and this decision will be controversial regardless of which groups are chosen . this is not to say that politicians only care about remaining in power ; they need to be in power to make decisions after all . while its certainly possible for smaller countries to be managed efficiently , it is difficult to expect a larger country to be run efficiently we just finished a basic income pilot in parts of ontario . my hometown growing up had a experimental curriculum which they eventually expanded into the entire region . that hole being that i can think of a few situations where a law could conceivably be ineffective if it is not applied to the whole country , ie . an anti gun city passes a law banning all firearms , but there is still free travel in and out of the city , the rate of gun homocide could conceivably go up because anybody who wants to shoot up a school just waltzes into the gun free zone with the conception that they will meet little resistance because no civilians have guns . in all of the above , the longer you take to enact it the easier it is to stall or stop outright , and the more people are liable to be harmed by the lack of actual action to help them . if a city wants to pass a law to test a new concept , that ’s great , and many cities do this . for example , in the us , many cities have stronger anti-discrimination laws locally than the federal level . however , at any one level , we should not give the government the power to treat citizens inequitably . one of the primary guarantees of a government is that it treats all its citizens equally . to allow the government to pick and choose which laws apply to which people would create a system ripe for corruption and inequality . for example , imagine the federal government wants to “ test ” tax breaks , and they do so by choosing to do so in states that voted for the current administration . or they want to “ test ” harsher sentences , so people committing murder in town x are punished more harshly than town y . such programs would be violate our guarantees of equal treatment by the government . if we were to follow such a deliberate approach , imagine how hard it would 've been to replace the articles of confederation . all group decisions are trade offs of one kind or another . ignoring all issues of feasibility , the problem with using a series of small randomized trials to test policy ideas is that while they are internally valid , there is little reason to believe their results would be generalizable in general equilibrium . for example , experiments with a large minimum wage increase may show very little effects on employment if the experimental population was a bunch of small cities in a state or even across the country . however , if you then enacted such a policy nation wide , the reason for that result could change . this is just speculation , but in the experiment , maybe the reason there was n’t really a change in employment is because large employers were able to lower labor costs elsewhere in their national supply chains . however , once implemented nationwide , there are no more labor cost savings possible , so prices rise , revenues fall , and layoffs start occurring . experimental programs can not work at all even though the program in general equilibrium would work great . and then based on this process you would throw away a bunch of great policy ideas . an example could be metropolitanizing education funding , so property taxes from a while metro area are distributed amongst schools rather than rich neighborhoods funding rich schools . however , unless you do it across the entire country , it is easy to see how rich people might just choose to move to areas in the control group of the experiment , just replicating the original problem on a larger scale . but your proposal of small scale tests for federal legislation is n't really necessary in the us . in the us , most legislating is at the state and local level unless there is a specific need for nationwide uniformity . another issue is that not all laws have quantifiable success outcomes . i 'll use the same example . they could run a test to see how private medical info remains before and after . how could we possibly do a small scale roll out of a disaster relief fund or anything akin to fdic insurance of banks ?"
9p1ev6,"people should stop assuming that someone in a political party believes everything that party believes in . i ’m a republican . but i believe that anyone can be married to anyone . as long as it does n’t hinder my rights you can marry whoever you want . you can spend the rest of your life with the any person you desire . the republican party believes in traditional marriage and voted against gay marriage in 2015 . i ca n’t believe it was not legal in the first place . things like that make me question the party continuously . my major beliefs belong to the republican party . therefore , i call myself republican . due to the political “ stereotypes ” running around , i sometimes call myself a centrist . i get slandered all the time by republicans calling me “ traitor ” or flat out ignoring me . i get assigned to the long belief list on the republican website . i actually hate many things republicans in power do . i do n’t like trump . i ’ve seen enough . this does n’t just apply to republicans though . it applies to all parties . i only know about the republican side because of my experience . we should stop assuming that people saying that they belong to a party automatically believes in everything it stands for .","for example , i am a strong supporter of free trade and a reasonably close to balanced budget . those 2 things alone would be enough for me to at least change to independent if i were a republican at this point . i switched from republican to democrat in the 90s due to my changing views on social issues though . a gay friend of mine put this in a way that made me re-evaluate my own views as a moderate : "" if you say that you 're a fiscal republican but you 're for gay marriage and gay rights , that just means you 're putting money above my rights . if you thought my rights mattered more than some money , you 'd vote against the republican party . "" its like saying "" not all republicans are racists , sexist and homophobic "" , this is True , but it also wasnt a deal breaker . if you tell me you are a republican , i immediately know that you either agree with , or do n't care , about the following issues ( for a few examples ) : centrist is hard to describe these days because republicans have successfully moved the overton window so far to the right that a centrist today would just be a reagan republican 30 years ago . both parties have polarized and their platforms are pretty much set in stone . when the republican party rallies behind economic measures that devastates marginal communities in the usa , you will be lumped in with the rest of the party . guess what neoliberals also believe a lot of what you do and they are trash too maybe this is n't a direct answer to your question , but i 've really come to see these political categories as the single most destructive force in current political discourse . i 've actually started work on an organisation whose mission is to de-politicise politics . as soon as one person or the other feels like they are dealing with someone who is fundamentally opposed to them , the chance for a middle ground to be reached dissapears . i really believe that there is much more common ground between people than the current political climate allows for . all to say i think the binary political categories your question centers around are a big problem everywhere right now , and the more we can do to start breaking them down the better off we will be . i think a part of why people make the assumption is that so many people who openly identify with a party , tend to base all their opinions off of that party . even with the tea party movement , the gop has now adopted many previous tea party positions and most of the base has altered their positions accordingly . the dems have more schools of thought and a strong and growing progressive wing . i 'm sort of off topic there , but if you heavily identify as democrat ( and not a progressive ) or as a republican ( and not libertarian ) , you most likely just tow the party line on most issues . it 's just a safe bet for them to assume many of your positions until you show them otherwise . if you say you are a republican it does n't mean you are a rapists ... but it does mean that being a rapists is n't a deal breaker for you . really you should stop assuming that someone in a political party even knows what the party believes in . they coined the term "" rino "" - republican in name only - for people who share most of the same views but differ on the real pearl-clutchers . a "" republican "" who holds beliefs like "" marijuana should be decriminalized "" or "" gay marriage is okay "" or "" maybe there should be some restrictions to gun ownership "" or "" social programs are sometimes okay "" would be labelled a rino , particularly if there are candidates running for election in that party . it 's very clear what views are and are not accepted by that party , and if you do n't check every box , they have a handy derogatory term ready-to-go for you . the point i 'm trying to make - if you do n't believe everything the republican party of america believes , then you are n't even considered "" one of them "" by other republicans . even if you truly do believe , like your example says , that gay marriage should be legal , by voting republican you 're saying "" yeah it should be legal , but i do n't really care if it 's not "" and that apathy really is n't too far-removed from wanting it banned outright . but i can safely assume either your view matches the republican party , or you do n't care enough about your view on that matter to make it one of your major beliefs . i get that you support marrying whoever you want , but apparently not that strongly and you 're content to both allow traditional marriage and support politicians who will institute traditional marriage . you 've kinda given up your only opportunity to make an impact on how our government decides to handle traditional marriage and i do n't foresee you making any other impacts based on how minor the issue seems to you ( like you do n't plan to show up to any gay marriage supporting rallies , correct ? ) the problem with free market toting republicans is that they are unwittingly defending giant banks and corporations who are actively funneling money from the poor to the rich and destroying the environment . if you say you 're a republican or a democrat , then you 're setting people 's expectations of what you believe , and you 're implying that you believe whatever is in their platform . i just say i 'm "" pretty liberal "" , even though that 's fraught with misunderstandings too . you 're part of a party of traitors , if you remain part of that party you are not worthy of respect . "" as long as it does n't hinder my rights "" ... i 've met other republicans who will say this same thing and i 'm genuinely curious why you believe that someone gaining rights would somehow affect yours ? first - if you support a party that has an official position that you disagree with , it ’s important to be vocal about that . second - there are views that are so deeply held that it ’s hard to excuse someone for belonging to a party that opposes that view . people who are single-issue abortion voters do n’t care what disagreements a democrat has with the democratic party ; by being a democrat you ’re supporting abortion and that makes you an enemy . on the left , an example is climate change . those who understand how truly dire the situation is ca n’t fathom anyone who would support the republicans - regardless of what individual positions they held . one should always assume that someone who is a republican believes in everything republicans do , because to be a republican means you believe in those things . the problem is a lot of being in a political party stems from at least adopting core principles or tolerating the ones you disagree with to achieve a political goal . the question then becomes "" should you be socially accountable to the principles you align with merely to achieve your political ambitions ? "" that 's a question of what principles you voluntarily tolerate within your own party . it ultimately all comes down to your personal choice and how much you 're willing to tolerate in order to hold political power within a party . wouldnt it be better if we just scrapped the first past the post system and moved away from the two party nightmare that way everyone can have a party that represents them ? the reason you joined the party was its political goals , its political goals are defined and represented by the body of the party , as long as you act in the name of the party it really does n’t matter what you believe in , worse if you represent the party and thus their goals against your belief you are a genuine hypocrite . if the majority of your parties political program goes against your belief you are either insane or , in case you profit from representing the party , an opportunist . so what does a centrist like you believe in , others than that there might be a way to infringe your rights via marriage ... for example , if someone identifies as feminist you will be immediately flooded with mental imagery of feminists and will form an opinion on that person based on your knowledge and understanding of feminism , rather than the feminists . so when you identify as a particular ideology , you 'll automatically open yourself up to all kinds of interpretation that is n't under your control . you can not control the general message of feminism , you can not control what other feminists say about feminism , you can not control how others view feminism . how many times do you hear the argument from a feminist ( just to stick to that example , it works for any ideology ) that "" that is n't what feminism really means "" , sure it does , it 's what it means to the person you 're interacting with , you do n't get to control their concept of feminism , so you need to understand if you 're going to identify as an idealogue you 'll be judged on a variety of factors out of your control . that basis was assuming that primary control of their associated party has a moderate lean . the republican party is heavily leaning far , far right , and no longer pushes an agenda that has any resemblance of compromise . i side with republicans on things like gun control but democrats on things like abortion . in any issue i try and keep an open ear and mind to both sides and make my choices accordingly . with that said , assumptions based off of labeling yourself as one thing or another will not likely change . you say you are a republican and people are going to assume you have a shrine to trump in your home and are a gun nut . a. you 're not describing being in a political party , as per your subject line . if you are in the party then you support the party platform . b. imo if you self-describe as a republican or a democrat ( or any other party ) , then yes you are saying you support the party and their platform . c. saying you are a conservative , conservative-leaning , a centrist , a fiscal-conservative/social-liberal , liberal-leaning , a liberal , etc. are very different than saying you are a republican or a democrat . tl , dr : if you do not support the party then do n't describe yourself that way . i grew up republican , and now find myself leaning far left socially , thinking of policy in terms of fiscal return , and embracing a right leaning foreign policy . despite you correctly saying that your major beliefs belong to the republican party , and you subsequently identifying with that party , you do know that parties change over time . sure , you can always switch affiliation when you think the time is right , but would n't it just be easier to register as nonpartisan ? this is assuming you believe the concept of parties does more harm than good , and , if everyone did that , then the system would likely change to one in which ideas are discussed with more importance than the people who make them . never again would you have to justify a label you 've associated yourself with — only ideas which you may or may not share with others . in order to avoid this when i registered to vote i registered as an independent because i refused to label myself and regardless , everyone would have made an assumption about me that would only be about 50 % correct . she talks about how much she hates republicans , and then goes on to agree with almost every individual platform item republicans stand for . then they should stop being in that party , or at least stop saying they are . "" teams "" are stupid , it 's a substitution for having your own opinion on things , even if that opinion is that you do n't know enough about something to have an opinion on it . part of that is ditching your stupid assed "" party "" or "" team "" . i do n't care if you do n't believe everything in a party , because you are still voting in people who will follow the party line : archaic views of women 's health , cutting the education budget , opposing actual living wages and workers rights , relaxing badly needed environmental regulations , affordable healthcare , etc etc . if that ’s the case , is it possible you feel you are apart of the republican party because that is how your family votes ? my team is right and your team is wrong , and i 'm not going to agree with your side on anything because they 're always always wrong . if you hold your own party accountable , you relieve the burden from the other party and other voters . whether you agree with everything a party stands for is irrelevant because , so long as you vote for them , you 're giving them the power to carry out their all of their policies - not just the ones you agree with personally . furthermore , if you disagree with a party on an issue but vote for them in spite of that , it shows that you do not prioritise said issue . for example , the gop has opposed same-sex marriage ; all republican voters thus either do not support same-sex marriage themselves or , at the very least , are largely apathetic to the issue . if you vote republican but do n't mind things like gay marriage and do n't like people assuming you do n't like gay marriage you 're still complicit in helping to vote in people who do n't like gay marriage by voting republican or by donating to the republican parties and affiliated organizations . similar to people who choose not to vote democrat while still saying they dislike trump more than hilary by choosing not to vote or vote republican regardless of what you personally believe you become complicit in their actions to some small degree if they win because you voted them in or did n't vote for another party . i 'd go one step further ... people should stop assuming that a political party reflects the most extreme views of its most extreme members . parties in the us are compromise , shared platforms that encompass wide areas of ground . she is very much all about people loving whom they love , but is also ultimately pro-life . add in a few other things she both does and does not believe in ( in regards to the republican party ) and viola ! however , when you choose to vote for an individual who is staunchly for or against an opposing view of yours , simply because they hold True to your beliefs in other categories and/or they are a member of your party .... you have invalided your own personal beliefs , and spoken louder with your actions than with your words by doing so . i think it 's time we all should adopt republicans ' strategy of generalizing everyone negative to promote a narrative . if you tell someone you ’re a republican and leave it at that , what else could they assume but that you are a republican through and through ? if you called yourself a liberal republican for example , it would cause people to make less assumptions about what that means . here 's the problem with this kind of thinking ... a vote for a republican politician is a vote that strengthens their ability to fight against gay marriage , even if you yourself have no issues with it . you can call yourself republican even if you do n't always vote for them . sounds like you 've already delta 'd , but to draw further from your example about gay marriage , i guess it depends on what you think is a cornerstone of your belief . lots of people might be fiscally conservative or believe in minimal government intervention in their lives , but would see the right for everyone to marry as fundamentally important and politically align themselves that way . you 're right in that no political party or platform is is likely to align perfectly with any one person 's views ; lots of these values are not mutually exclusive across platforms , but there 's a big difference between "" marry whoever you want so long as it does n't affect me , but i wo n't triumph your right to do so "" and seeing the blocking of that right as something that is n't trivial enough to see as a side-issue . it seems to me that you have some differences in opinion with the republicans party that are not minor . i can understand that you might typically vote republican but making the party part of your identity does n't make much sense . most people i know like you do n't say they are republican . they say i 'm an independent but i primarily vote on x issue , so i usually vote for republicans . do n't let anyone shame you into not calling yourself a republican if your major beliefs line up with their policies . a more apt name for your beliefs might be conservative or something like that as "" republican "" generally means you support the party to a larger degree than what it seems you do . people do n’t realize about 50 % of republicans ( possibly more ) believe we need to do something about climate change . you vote for the party that aligns with these issues you find important . however , as the way the world works , that party also aligns with issues x , y , and z . you tell yourself and others that you value a , b , and c - but you are a centrist because you do not also agree with the party stance on x , y , and z . a persons silence/complacency/willingness to accept is indirect support of x , y , and z . the party you agree with has nothing to worry about from voters in adding crazy things to their platform because they are confident that they will maintain even a large portion of their centrist voters due to a , b , and c. effectively they have no negative repercussions and can pursue x , y , and z all because there are folks who will follow them due to a , b , and c . in fact , there are many single issue voters out there . each one tells themselves that they vote party a because of issue a , but because they do not support party a 's other issues they are not morally responsible and should not be held accountable for those other actions that party a does because they , themselves do not support those particular actions and were only voting for party a for issue a. "" history will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the strident clamor of the bad people , but the appalling silence of the good people . "" i 'm not saying that if you decide issue a is the most important thing in the world to you that you are ' evil ' for voting that party a. however , you should acknowledge that you are also supporting , indirectly , those other items on the platform that come along with your issue a . so it is not a stretch for an ' outsider ' to say that you support those x , y , and z issues - because you have , through your support of party a. note : even with a 3 party or more system this issue is not magically resolved , there will always be things you agree and disagree with . you just have to make a personal decision on the balancing of your personal values and morals what you are willing to accept to get issue a. sall "" r "" republican is a political stance in opposition to monarchy or a monarchical government ( see ireland ) . your political views are based on a political doctrine , philosophy or ideology and not party affiliation since party is a group of people with a common political interest ( i.e. power ) and any ideology or any platfor is instrumental to that purpose . when you describe your political views you should therefore use appropriate terms : you are a liberal conservative or moderate conservative or libertarian or even liberal ( in european i.e. correct political classification ) at least the similarly deceptive split into "" conservatives "" and "" liberals "" refers to broad ideologies and not party allegiance . but even that is wrong as there are no uniform two sides with undecided people ( independents , moderates , centrists , whatever ) but two loose coalitions of diverse voting blocs . compare it with europe where you can have three socialist parties , two liberal parties , a conservative ( christian democrat ) party and a popular/agrarian party in a parliament and that will still not include half of the parties that did not cross the voting threshold . you can be liberal and vote for liberal democrats and you can be liberal and vote for labour although it was traditionally a socialist party . in fact in 20th century britain become more european/continental in its political tradition while america kept the old tory/whig duopoly that only evolves through consecutive party systems . it is a conspiracy of both parties to maintain the status quo which benefits them and it includes the republicans as well as the democrats who ruled the us for over 50 years from 1932 to 1996 . in fact it is only very recently that they can be really blamed for anything since even during the "" evil reagan "" era dems controlled the house . this is a very toxic view of the world that leads to serious issues and unnecessary politicization of everyday life since it ties political party allegiance or a "" team "" to any of your ideological decisions . and liberal ( less conservative ) factions and there is a high disconnect between party and ideology then feminism is perceived as one of many ways of approaching the issue . in america however feminism managed to establish itself as the women 's advocacy in general public discourse since it is the most overtly political of ideologies concerning gender and democrats being a huge political blob of "" everyone who is not republican "" became their playground . or alternatively it 's just like christianity claiming the moral monopoly i.e. why it is harder to be elected president in america if you are an ethical white male successful businessman and atheist , compared to a crooked black lesbian muslim trans advocate and former prostitute . we ’re talking about grown ass adults who label you completely if there ’s an “ r ” attached to you . no , political parties should be abolished because if a candidate does n't agree with the party on the vast majority of issues , then they usually wo n't receive campaign funding from said party if you vote for that party , you vote for , and hold a share of responsibility for , all of the things that party pushes for . in my eyes , a republican is someone who is actually a part of the party and not a voter . someone in the party volunteers or has a job working for the party . as long as you support candidates who do support the things that you claim not to agree with i do n't really care what your personal beliefs on the matter actually are . if you do n't believe that republicans should fight against marriage equality or you do n't believe that they should defund medicaid , medicare , and social security , but vote for people who want to do those things then your personal beliefs do n't really matter , because your actions say that you do believe it . similarly , if i say that i do n't believe the government should fund everyone 's education , but i vote for people who support college loan forgiveness for everyone regardless of income or personal wealth , then you should n't care what i personally believe , my actions have spoken for themselves . as for the republicans voting no on gay marriage , not many are against its legality anymore . i mean , i feel for you , but if you give your money to vampires , vote for vampire candidates , live with vampires and call yourself a vampire , you saying "" hey , i do n't think humans should be the psycho-sexual slaves of vampires or anything , i 'm just in it for the cheap coffin prices "" does n't change the fact you are helping the vampires . you can say you do n't care if gay people marry one another , but you voting for a party that is against that means you do n't care if gay people are n't allowed to marry each other , either . you vote for people who vote against gay marriage , therefore you fight against gay marriage , end of the story . whatever you think , whatever you say , in the end it 's always about your vote . in the end , if you vote republican then everyone gets the whole kit . i 'm a republican and i voted for the republicans are 2 entirely different statements . if you 're part of a club whose official platform promotes discrimination and child abuse ( as the gop 's official platform does ) , and you refuse to leave that club or stop giving them money , then it 's fair to assume you support that club 's official platform , including the parts that call for discrimination and child abuse ( or at the very best those parts do n't bother you enough to give up the massive deficits , endless war , lack of healthcare , job loss , or economic failure the gop also brings ) . i believe anyone can be married to anyone and that 's why i 'd never label myself as a republican because that 's against the official platform but how else am i supposed to categorize everyone else into a cliched version of the world so that i can pretend i 'm a special individual with greater aspirations and that my generation is the only one to have a real passion for the world . the only ones that come even close to me is my social circle , and that 's because i only surround myself with the best people in the world . that ’s why instead of using parties like republicans and democrats , it ’s easier to use labels like centrist , social liberal , fiscal conservative , social conservative , alt right , libertarian etc . if you do n't agree with a lot of it you could always call yourself right-wing or conservative . itt : liberals pretending they 're the only ones who ever held their nose while voting . in one of the episodes , will , played by jeff daniels , was interviewing one of the fictional republican who was running for governor or president ( do n’t remember which ) . anyway , that republican who ’s being interviewed was dropped from the campaign because he was willing to work with the opposition , bc he believes that both parties have a duty to represent america . i do n’t remember much from that episode but it was something i have n’t forgotten bc i feel that in the current political situation , both parties are acting like kids and not owning up to their own ideals . while there are certainly left-wing absolutists , one of the traits that drives me nuts in the "" big tent "" democratic party ( locally ) is the impulse to give our opponents a fair hearing . that does come with its own pros and cons doing that though , but it does also help weed out people that just automatically jump to conclusions . right now you 're identifying with the pro-rape , disability mocking , dictator worshipping party that calls journalists enemies of the people . if you 're too stupid and immoral to stop identifying as a republican under these circumstances , you deserve all the flack you get . in the end , every good citizen in our democracy looks at the available candidates in the primary and votes for the one who most fits their ideals - political and moral - to represent their party . when you vote for many republicans , you are voting for a list of things that the party supports , as do most of its candidates : repeal of obergefell v. hodges ( allowing states to ban gay marriage ) but you do n't like being criticized by people who think that voting republican makes you complicit in some of those other , civil libertarian issues . as long as you identify as a republican , and vote for republican candidates , that 's a fair criticism of you , because that 's what you 're allowing your intrinsic political power to be used for . people should stop identifying with political parties if they dont hold every view those parties believe in . i 've watched the democratic party bash progressives for years while paying lip service to social issues and being center to center-right on foreign policy , wall street regulations , and especially on issues regarding all the money swirling around congress . mainstream democrats have been moving to the right for decades to appeal to moderates and to pad their pocketbooks , and only recently have started to shift back left when they finally started to realize the were losing more of their base than was being gained in new moderate voters . i could have called myself a member of the democratic party the whole time and been more right than wrong on sheer percentage . no , i will vote based on the policies that the men and women running align themselves with , and when that means i 'm voting republican ( very rare , best example i have is the mayor of my town after years of a corrupt democrat ) or independent or third party ( unless it 's the general election for president , i 'm not interested in lighting that particular vote on fire ) so be it . your party is n't interested in you beyond your money and your vote . honestly - you probably are closer to a centrist with how far right the gop have taken the republican party . history books will write about the 2007-xxxx republican party as the most conservative , ridiculous form it ’s ever gotten to . trump has even further transformed the republican party far more effectively than tea party conservatives ever hoped . again - that is what you are currently associating yourself with by calling yourself republican . if the things the gop has done in the past 10 years , more notably in the past 6 , does n’t bother you or make you question the people you associate with - you deserve every label the collective group gets . it got so ridiculous that in 2015 i changed parties to democrat so that i could vote in the primary . again - if what they ’ve done in the past 10 years does n’t bother you , and you still label yourself a republican ... . you know how chastising it is speaking against the religion you were born and raised into . in fact often times i believe that they do n't agree with what their party believes in , but because they are part of the same party , they want their side to win and will defend them . i do n't know when competition between parties that are supposed to represent the citizen 's best interests became the regular . i 've always thought of political parties the same way that i think about the government as a whole . people always assume that the policies of a party do n't change , but they actually evolve quite a bit over time . if every person who identified as republican only voted for republican candidates that abandoned trickle down economics , then the republican party would no longer have trickle down economics as part of its platform . if you 're voting for republicans , then either you oppose gay marriage or gay marriage is not particularly important to you , relative to other political issues . the problem with political parties , in the usa in particular , is the lack of other options . the fact that you believe people should be able to marry whoever they want , but voted for republicans and call yourself one , means that at best you do n’t give much of a damn that people are having that right trampled on . just not enough to not support them or to stop being a member of their party based on that conduct . i call myself a classical liberal , or a left-leaning centrist to distance myself from them . perhaps you 'd be better off calling yourself a conservative instead , because that ties you less to the party itself and more to ( i think ) the ideals that you share with them . stating that you belong to a specific group inevitably means you are associated with the most prominent current example of each group . if two people are meeting for the first time and one states belonging to a group , the other must react to that utilising the information they currently have ... furthermore by stating membership you become a representative of the position of the party within that specific social scenario . there is a benefit to using such tags , you can be accepted into a group , make friends and be part of the gang . in summary by stating membership you become a representative of a party with specific social benefits and costs . sure , it 's unfair for me to assume you have unconditional support of all your party 's beliefs , but the assumption that you are willing to tolerate it is fair game . if you claim to dislike the republican 's stance on gay marriage , women 's rights , voter suppression , child separation , climate change denial , corruption , hypocrisy , lying , or any other fault , but still vote republican , then the simple truth is that you do n't care enough about those issues to break away from the party . talk is cheap , anyone can say they stand for anything , but if they are n't willing to act on those claims or continue to support those who carry on those policies , then they do n't deserve the benefit of the doubt because they 're either a liar or a hypocrite . that said , you can have a priority of complaints that mean you temporarily vote for one party over another . you might see the stance on gay marriage as an affront to civil liberty or basic human emotion , and that might take priority over whatever complaints you have about the democrats . political affiliation should n't be a personal identifier and who you vote for should be as much about the current needs as your personal ideology . when you do n't vote for the guys who support policy you hate , a new candidate is likely to arise to fill the position next election , maybe one more in-line with your personal ideology . political parties fill in and try to capture as many voters as possible , so they will take note when certain issues are costing them voters . it does n't mean you believe in it but you 're responsible for it if you put that person in office . if you say you do n't agree with what the party does in power yet you keep voting for them , you need to accept that you 're actually ok with what they are doing and you 're just trying to save face . if you hang with republicans but are not unbudgingly set in your beliefs , you might try saying you are an "" eisenhower republican "" . if we 're meeting at a ( cocktail ) party and want to discuss politics , then certainly we should discuss various issues and not assume each other 's opinions on one issue dictate opinions on others . and particularly in the present century , 1 of the 2 parties has publicly dedicated themselves to 2 rules : the hastert rule , which says no republican legislator is allowed to vote for any bill not supported by a majority of republicans , and the mcconnell rule , which says every republican legislator must dedicate himself to obstructing by all possible means every policy initiative of a democratic president , even if its content has been previously endorsed by many republicans . which means that by casting a vote for any republican at any level , you 're declaring your total personal opposition to any policy proposal any democrat ever comes up with , regardless of its merits . of course there are honorable individuals who identify as republican because many of the long-standing stated principles of that party align with their own deeply-held beliefs . but republican office-holders ( especially at the federal level ) are constrained from exercising independent thought or principle . again , it sounds like hair-on-fire propaganda , but it 's just plain fact : if you 're voting republican , you 're supporting the dismantling of american democracy . it is my own personal opinion that the republican party has been distilled to nothing more than a white nationalist movement , not only in america but across europe as well . after trump , faux "" news "" is n't even allowed to make a big deal about a politician banging pornstars a month after his kid was born , since i agree it 's not . i 'd be interested in hearing what you think a lefty/liberal is and by contrast , what most people would say being republican is ? if you enjoy premarital sex , pot , r-rated movies , explicit lyric stickers , fun sex , pot , modern basketball shorts , slutty chicks , civil rights for dudes who like guys and pot you may need to read your bible more harder and goodly . when someone associates themselves with a political party , then it 's reasonable to assume they associate themselves with the beliefs of that party . the problem is that one should n't associate themselves with a political party . vote for the candidate that aligns most with your principles , regardless of which party they belong . i do n't think the issue is really that everyone thinks people believe 100 % of any party 's platform , but rather that because we live in a two party system , you have to vote for the policies you do n't want if you want the desirable ones to pass . that 's obviously out of your control , but it requires that you really take a hard look at who you 're voting for and decide whether the one thing you want that they support is as important as the things you want from the other party . you 'd have some right of center parties that might be more moderate socially , focusing on economic issues form a conservative standpoint but ignoring things like gay marriage and abortion . you 'd also have left of center parties that are even farther left than the democrats , pushing hard for socialized medicine and education while the democrats are mostly concerned about center left policies like business regulation . but since we do n't have that , you 're always going to be associated with even the dumbest policies that your favored party supports , even if you do n't support them as well . someone we knew claimed that every person who voted for trump was racist . my roommate and i both disagreed with this , though in different ways . lets say , for example , ( i ’m not claiming this as True , it ’s purely a hypothetical ) that trump ’s immigration policies are objectively racist ( again , not claiming that ’s how it actually is , just using it as an example ) . if that person votes for trump for his economic policies , that vote supports all of trump ’s platform , and therefore also supports the racist immigration policies . they may not have voted for him because of the immigration policies , but their vote still forwarded that cause . so in this case it is n’t fair to call that person a racist for voting for trump , but it is fair to say that person ’s vote supported racist policies . you may not have any negativity towards marriage equality , and it would not be okay to assume you do . but someone could claim that your vote supported the platform that fought against marriage equality , and therefore that your vote still damaged that cause . although i align with the policy platform of the democratic party on many issues , not all by far . for example , i used to identify with fiscal conservatism of the republican party but now they are driving the deficit with unfunded tax cuts . whenever i am stuck in an airplane and the conversation inevitably turns to politics , i say i am interested in discussing any policy issue but i am not interested in having a debate about the president . the conversation can be really short with people who are unable or unwilling to get beyond party identification to talk about the issues . people should n't stop assuming that someone believes all party beliefs . so if we establish that most people who self identify as left or right usually share a plurality of those views then there is n't any reason not to assume they have most of those common left/right views . it 's perfectly fine to internally assume that if someone says they 're republican you then start internally running down the list in your mind of what they 're most likely to think . so ultimately what ends up happening is , i tell someone i 'm a conservative , they tell me i 'm a nazi and then they never make it past that first snap judgement to ask me why . they just assume that they have all the information they need to make a value judgement against my character which neither broadens their horizons or let 's them see me as a person and not some fictitious villain . the problem is not that someone is assuming you toe the party lines on all issues ; the issue is that they ca n't look past that to see you as an individual . what we really need for america to succeed in the real world , is to enforce a simple and elegant law that holds a president accountable for everything that he/she has said during his/her run as a candidate . despite the contrary , many of the party 's supporters will become rotten apples themselves . however , the only reason that this happens , is because their party of choice , is constantly broadcasting news about terrible events to them . they vote for not who is actually right , but for whoever is the one who will solve all of their problems , because they were told that "" their problems are outside your control . "" this is why politicians who do not fulfill their campaign promises keep on being re-elected . ah this is why everyone should be a registered independent and not simply for vote blue or red because that 's their duty to their partisanship obligation , even though that 's not how its supposed to be it is . people should stop joining political parties or believe anything that their political party supposedly believe in . the vast majority of the politicians in both parties ( us ) are corrupt and only in it for themselves . if you support the homophobic baby killing lynch mob party and a gay person ask you why , you can always say "" ohhhh i do n't support that part of the part "" and then when you run into a mother you again just say "" ohhhh i did n't really like that part of it and i 'm not some robot for the party "" ad nasium . then if so , i ask which ones . if those republicans voted for do not follow the core principles and the person claiming the ideology votes for them anyway , then it does n't really matter what that voter thinks they believe in . it ’s an issue to blanket all people together into two parties and assume they agree with each party ’s stance , when again there are literally two legitimate options ."
9p18tn,"the us government should pay for preventative care and catastrophic coverage for all americans there 's endless debate about what 's needed to fix healthcare in the us , and why we seem to pay more ( as a % of gdp ) for healthcare than most countries without better outcomes . all proposals seems to end up stalemated , whether they be for a more market based system , or something like medicare for all , and we only make the slightest improvements that usually do n't rock the boat of the existing system , such as obamacare . my view is that the government should go ahead and pay for basic preventative coverage for all americans , including annual checkups , flu shots , reproductive health , and education on diet/hygiene . because this care prevents costlier care down the line , and because we end up all paying for that costlier care ( er visits by uninsured individuals , lost productivity , etc. . . ) it would be a net gain to prevent this things . my second view is that the gov ' t should cover you in the case of a catastrophic event such as cancer or an automobile accident that exceeds your ability to pay for care . say in the tens of thousands of dollars . the government is already the payer of last resort for most americans , since medicare kicks in at 65 and most medical costs are racked up after that . this would simply cover the folks who hit a major medical crisis at an earlier age . the government often steps in , anyway , say when people need emergency medicaid for nicu stays or things like that . the cost of these things could be covered by a tax , that would be offset by the fact that almost everyone would be paying less for their insurance , and because everyone gets the same coverage ( like medicare ) the program would be much more politically palatable than programs than programs that only offer benefits to specific groups , like medicaid . if we did these two things , the population would get healthier , and people would n't have their ( financial ) lives ruined by medical issues . we could continue to have a private market for everything in between , but these plans would be much less expensive because the private insurers would be off the hook for catastrophes . change my view . or rather , poke holes in plan .","there are max out-of-pocket costs so that individuals are paying far less than $ 30,000 for a catastrophic event , most preventative care is covered , and high premium costs to provide that coverage are then subsidized well into the upper middle class ( up to ~ $ 80,000 household incomes ) to make it affordable to those who would otherwise struggle to pay . i also do n’t think your plan would be any more politically feasible , republicans will see it as a step towards “ socializing all healthcare ” , and they ’re probably not even wrong on that front , so it would be fought just as passionately as a full privatization because they see it as a step towards that . obamacare has proven to be teflon to republicans exactly because it preserves the fully private system , but just sets standards for plans and care to avoid an insurance death spiral while paying the extra costs for those who ca n’t afford it . any political capital you could spend implementing your system would be better spent expanding obamacare and making it better , and because it already exists , you can do that with little pushes whenever there is political will rather than needing to overhaul the entire system again after only a few years since the last overhaul really kicked into high gear . the trick is not really so much as details of what should be covered , or even how to pay it ( so that ’s a really big problem , too : to my knowledge there is not a single country which has both an extremely large military and a very strong social network ; chances are , maintaining both is just way too expensive ) . the problem is , how do you persuade a clear majority of the population to support this program in the current political climate where half of the people mistrust everything from the other half , and political parties both pursue the division rather than unification of the country ? one thing to note about this and most government subsidy proposals is that it will add administrative costs to healthcare that most people outside of economists do not take into account in their estimates . in regards to your proposal , i personally have been priced out of standard insurance plans by obamacare because the subsidies are n't nearly on pace with what they expect your contribution to be ( \ ~ 9 % of income ) for my tax bracket . quite simply put , any plan i can afford costs too much in premiums to turn around and afford the co-pays and deductibles involved . new competition ca n't enter the market due to the barrier of the regulations and thus one company can exercise control of the price of the service . and that 's not even mentioning the added risk and administrative costs to the company in question that would force prices higher even in the few competitive markets . [ -- url -- ) this is what happens when you cut out the insurance company entirely , i go to a direct bill clinic that is a member of the wedge and could get a full physical and blood work each month for the cost of a silver plan on obamacare . quite simply put , markets work , and when you cut out the middle man , you get cheaper predefined and agreed upon prices upfront , and a bill at the end . insurance used to be a purely catastrophic investment and the wedge puts it back were it belongs . medical assistance has its place for people that genuinely ca n't afford the cost of healthcare , but insurance of any type drives the cost of the healthcare it covers up , not down . making the government pay into a system that can charge whatever they want is n't a solution to anything . education , safety , healthcare are the common good and should n't be for profit . the problem is this causes a myriad of problems including incredibly long wait times for ' non urgent ' procedures ( for example a hip replacement which could be solve a ton pain , but is n't life threatening ) and private doctors being unable to accept these forms of insurance due to financial viability . you said that we 'd pay for annual checkups , but people often need to go to the doctor more than once a year , and without insurance that can get expensive fast . many countries have a system where people pay a very small co-pay every time they visit the doctor ( sometimes of just 1 to 2 dollars ) and the rest is covered . that 's just one example of an improvement on what you 've proposed , but in general i think the best way to do it is a single-payer system where everyone is given automatic , comprehensive health insurance funded by the taxpayers . you actually seem to understand the rationale behind this really well : whenever someone has a medical bill that they ca n't pay , the taxpayers foot that bill anyway , and then that person does n't receive proper care and accumulates more medical problems that we end up paying for again . ideally , we should have a system where people 's medical bills are already paid so that they can stay healthy . you would basically be taxing healthy people to pay for this , and those people are already taking preventative actions of their own free will . when you say that "" the government "" should pay for it , where do you think this money is going to come from ?"
9p0j3a,"the availability of abortion procedures should be determined only by women . hello everyone , i have an opinion that really has no basis in facts or statistics , it is just a gut opinion of mine . i believe that life starts at conception . i am a male . i do not believe abortions are ethical ( with exceptions to rape , incest or the abortion being necessary to preserve the mother 's life ) . i would hope that my partner would not terminate a pregnancy , but i also recognize that women are in a situation unique to their gender . men will never be trapped in a pregnancy and forced to carry a human baby to term . literally , men can not become impregnated . due to the unique circumstances of this issue , i do not think men should be allowed to decide whether or not a woman can or can not receive an abortion . i do not have a solution or suggestion as to how we would only let women decide on abortion rights . as strongly as i feel against abortions , i believe reproductive rights ( not only limited to abortions ) should be fully in place and protected for women . if someone does n't believe in using birth control or termination , that is perfectly acceptable . but that does not give them a right to stop others from exercising their rights . the actual bearer of children can and should have more control over her own body . & #x200b ;","men who are pro-life have just as much right to try to stop others as women do , because being pro-life is about stopping other people from "" murdering "" , since you always have the option to not abort your own baby in either case . in fact , in some ways it is more nobel , because they are fighting for the rights of others , not including themselves . and men suffer consequences from both . they suffer knowing all those fetuses are being killed or they suffer from having to care for a baby they help conceive that might not be legal to abort . in some ways men have an even stronger case , because in a world with legalized abortion , women are allowed to kill a man 's baby without the man 's consent . also , even if the women are liberal , they would be liberal , and go to far in their support for abortion , such as having it paid in tax revenue . so , woman can do whatever she wants to her own body , so does men . that means all adults , male and female , have a say regarding to what happens to a everything from zygote , embryo , fetus , and up to a baby . unfortunately , if you think of anything after zygote is a person , women 's freedom stops when their action have impact on their pregnancies . the debate has never been about taking away the rights of women , it is only about giving unborn babies right . that 's obviously a bit ridiculous , but when you say "" determining the availability of abortion "" you 're not just talking about what 's legal , and what 's not , but also about things like access to facilities and staff . suppose a pregnant woman does something that would be otherwise illegal , and then claims it was an attempt to abort the pregnancy . ultimately , "" determined only by women "" is a bit more vague than you may think it is . like many political slogans it does n't have to have clear meaning , but only has to "" feel right "" to be adopted by people . this is a relatively subtle point , but let 's , for the sake of argument , consider the proposition that liability for paternity claims should be determined only by men . that makes me think that this "" only women experience "" stuff is more like making an excuse than a driving motivation . the problem is that the abortion rights debate is an attempt to weigh the interests of two different groups -- ( 1 ) the women who want to get abortions , and ( 2 ) the pro-life side believe that the unborn children also have rights and that their interests should be weighed . if you say "" only women should vote on abortion policy "" , then you 're just giving all the votes to one side of the debate , without representing the other side . thus the problem is just like any other debate where you give all the votes to people on just one side of the debate . in the debate over the death penalty , should we give all the votes to people who have family members murdered ( so most of them would be in favor ) ? or give all the votes to people who are on death row ( so most of them would be against it ) ? we collect the relevant data and make the decision as a group . however , once a woman is pregnant , she does not have a choice on someone else 's life . if you believe life starts at conception but also believe that women should be able to make abortions widely available , you 're making a big contradiction . just because they 're women does n't mean they should be able to kill humans ( by your definition ) . if that 's the case , then there 's no difference between killing a month old fetus and killing a month old baby . should both men and women be able to determine the legality of killing a one month old baby , or is that reserved for women as well ? or is there some reason that women could tell a specific woman that she ca n't get an abortion , while men could n't tell that specific woman that she ca n't get an abortion ? which does give your argument some merit ( though your argument ignores infertile women giving them the right to dictate what others do ) . but those who are pro-life are not actually arguing against bodily autonomy , they are arguing for the rights of an unborn human and are attempting to prevent its killing , something many consider to be murder . you also have the fact that men are also parents and they have intrinsic rights over their children as well as the mother . now i can concede that they should not have as much say as the mother in regards to pregnancy decisions due to their body not being the vessel of the child , but they should still have some say in how things go . your idea of completely excluding them from even the discussions on things completely strips them of all reproductive rights and you can not correct an error in justice by committing the same injustice to a different group . the decision to have an abortion is indeed very personal . for starters , the ultimate outcome of your position is an internalized belief that if a law does n't directly affect you , you should n't be able to vote on it . if we extend this logic to other aspects of law your positions falls apart . the ability to abort has ramifications beyond the scope of just women making the decision . the entire aspect of voting , is so that people can voice their opinions on the way society is run not the private decisions of citizens . if someone is voting against abortion they are deciding that the greater ramifications irrespective of opinion outweigh the need to have abortion as an option . i 'm male and i 'm very pro-choice , but i still deserve a vote because if women vote to ban abortions i still have to pay taxes to fix their mess . which means i am a stakeholder in the outcome of abortion laws . the state should n't chase men down when a woman is financially downtrodden and seeks the states help , hence the state chases after the father . a woman can be in one of 2 situations : she wants an abortion before 12 weeks after conception or after these 12 weeks . the woman has to declare she 's in an emergency situation ( not being able to provide for a child is considered a valid emergency situation ) the abortion has to be performed by a doctor in a medical facility under justifiable circumstances and only after it has been explained to the woman which laws and decrees could help in here situation the abortion shall not be performed within 6 days of the first consultation with the doctor that will be performing the abortion the doctor has to inform the woman about the possible medical consequences she 's exposing herself to by getting an abortion . the doctor has to remind the woman right before the abortion of all the possible shelters if the child was to be bron the doctor has to be personally convinced that the woman will not change her mind . an abortion is only possible if the continuation of the pregnancy poses a credible threat to the woman 's life or if it 's determined that the child will be born with a terminal disease that is considered very severe the law does not provide a definition for ' an emergency situation ' , ' a disease that is considered very severe ' or ' justifiable circumstances ' . the law is however crystal clear that only the woman has a say in the abortion . for example , if a woman gets pregnant and they 're both too poor to support a kid , and the mother does n't want to abort . as for abortion , no human should have the right to use another human 's body without permission , including fetuses . if you hit someone with your car , and they needed blood , no doc could force you to donate blood to save a life because it 's unethical and you did n't consent ."
9ozgff,"people do n't understand politics and political discourse & it 's our faults this is more of a dump of thoughts less then a coherent argument . & #x200b ; from the way i see current involvment in politics , i do n't think people really understand politics . the current political discourse boils down to childish name calling and witch hunts that are ultimatly counter productive to the conversations that should be have . people are gravitating towards name calling to derail any conversation ( far right , communist etc ) and this shows that very few people are politically literate enough actually partake in any real conversation and people do n't have the attention span to take the time to understand politics and the complexities of it . i also think that mob mentality is drowning out any real contributions too which might have infleunced my cynicism around this but i do n't know if that makes it better or worse . & #x200b ; i think the current state of politics is our fault because we 've moved away from taking time and thought to understand something rather we jump on bandwagons lead by people that benifit from ignorance . i do n't reasonably believe that the majority of people can contribute to the conversation properly , lack of time and interest contributes to this , but have been forced into believing they have to and therefore taking stupid & ill informed positions . i think the culture created around feeling duty to be a part of something bigger plays a huge and detromental part in the state of current discourse . & #x200b ; i strongly believe in democracy and the importance of giving people a voice , but i believe that the voices being heard are hurting the conversation & #x200b ; sorry if this did n't make sense .","children who have n't learned these things grow into adults that really do n't have a clue about how government and politics work . without knowing how government actually works , positions that might be reasonable are tossed or the "" opposition "" blamed because they do n't actually know what is possible for the government to do . except that if you remove most people from the group , you remove the wisdom of the crowd . not much to understand - some people good , other people bad , most people mixed . i can only imagine the quality of conversation you are experiencing is due in part to the content that you are viewing . here are some suggestions if you want a more reason discussion ( grouped by category . joe rogan ( i am not exactly sure where he sits politically , but he has great interviews with people on both sides all the time ) jimmy dore ( can kind of get on long winded angry rants at times , but he is well informed even if i do not agree with much of his politics , his joe rogan interview was great ) dave rubin ( does great mellow interviews of people on both sides of the isle , his interview with larry elder is epic ) it 's corrupt and/or self serving politicians faults along with the two party politics involved . people do n't understand political discourse because there 's no proper way to go learn . people do n't understand politics in general for the same reasons - they just shy away from it because its toxic . i would say that the nature of democracy must include the voices which remain ignorant because democracy is not about finding the right answer . in that regard , if you truly support democracy , then realize that the voices which do not possess the same understanding or intelligence as others matter just as much . the ignorant voices , even if they hurt the conversation , are part of the process of democracy . democracy , especially representative democracy , has always encouraged grouping together to support common goals . i think the main cause behind the "" name calling "" discourse that you brought up earlier is n't actually down to people not knowing anything about politics . it 's easy to think that it 's just the fault of people being stupid , but our society has more access to education than ever before . it 's very easy to confuse people into not understanding or not caring if you manage to make rhetoric devolve into simple name-calling or nonsense . this is highly beneficial to those in power specifically because it makes people less likely to participate in politics , and thus makes them more likely to stay in power ."
9oz3gp,"i do n't believe people should press a specific ancestry if it 's extremely distant . i think it opens the door to a dangerous pseudo-reality where people might try to pick and choose how they represent their ancestry for their own benefit or to feel unique . i think white people in particular who have little to no ancestral ties to a minority group might attempt to emphasize that ancestry for social or economic benefit . especially when white people are framed as an oppressor in some circles . why i might feel this way , i grew up as a white person in a community that was heavily aboriginal . my mother 's family relatively recently moved from eastern europe to live on a canadian reservation . despite not being mixed my family for generations has taken part in activities typically associated with the metis . when i graduated high school i won an award specific to the metis even though i was n't part of that minority.i had to turn down the award and i chose to give the ceremonial sash to a visibly upset metis friend who was n't eligible due to grades . the reality where i 'm from is that many status aboriginals carry the last names of prominent metis settlers and for some of them you can even trace their ancestry back to a metis settlers . none of them openly choose to highlight their white ancestry in the same ways you see some white people try to highlight their minority ancestry . i ca n't help but feel that white people choosing to maximize their minority ancestry are looking for some sort of benefit ( whether it be social , economic or even trying to rid themselves of some sort of guilty conscience ) . i also find it concerning when i look at pictures of university groups that are suppose to be made of minorities and large portions of them are made up of people who look white . this is really not a big issue though as skin colour probably is n't a great indicator especially when someone is mixed . ( i have two cousins who are brothers one looks white and the other looks aboriginal . i also want to highlight that i ’m from canada . our employments equity laws are typically much stronger than american affirmative action policies .","i think it 's fine because traditions are family history and are passed down . if it 's something your family has always celebrated it does n't matter if you are now only 1/128th native if you were raised with it as a big part of your culture and life and tradition . someone who is half native has a strong claim to the culture and raises their kid , who is now 1/4th , to have it strongly as their identity and so on . i think it 's up to the person being raised in the culture to decide they do n't feel a part of it and do n't feel like passing it on . the flip side of the coin : white people might feel more connected/empathetic towards minority group when they realize that they have some shared ancestry , helping to reduce racism over time . it 's really only pretty recently , and only within some specific circles , where having connection to a marginalized or minority group was seen as something to be celebrated . historically , most people tried to cling hard to their whiteness , even if they had some "" non-white "" ancestry . so perhaps your post would be better stated as "" people should n't seek to capitalize on a specific ancestry if it 's distant , or they specifically did n't live the experience of being part of that group .

"" elizabeth warren 's words and actions are emblematic of a subtle , but also vile form of "" progressive "" racism . i do n't mean the ignorant claims of "" reverse racism "" spouted by white nationalists . i mean the kind of racism that uses the enforced hardships of racial and ethnic minorities in the us to propel one 's own selfish ends . this is a strange concept for most white liberal people to think about , but fortunately , one of the best movies from last year explains it perfectly . this idea of "" liberal racism "" is the theme of get out . here is how a guardian article frames the issue ( spoiler alert ) . > the villains here are n’t southern rednecks or neo-nazi skinheads , or the so-called “ alt-right ” . they ’re middle-class white liberals . the kind of people who read this website . the kind of people who shop at trader joe ’s , donate to the aclu and would have voted for obama a third time if they could . good people . nice people . your parents , probably . the thing get out does so well – and the thing that will rankle with some viewers – is to show how , however unintentionally , these same people can make life so hard and uncomfortable for black people . it exposes a liberal ignorance and hubris that has been allowed to fester . it ’s an attitude , an arrogance which in the film leads to a horrific final solution , but in reality leads to a complacency that is just as dangerous . i believe that elizabeth warren has done the same thing as the villains in that film . she has claimed native american ancestry to frame herself as a victim . this victim status allows her to present herself with a "" rags to riches "" all-american success story . as another example of this idea , consider this clip from south park . i think the entire thing is one step above rachel dolezal . the way she presented it has n't convinced any native americans . she has n't met with tribal leaders or done anything to show she cares about that group during her time in office . she has used them as a prop . her goal was never to court their votes . her goal was to appeal to white progressives like herself . it 's the same way that donald trump talks about violence in chicago and asks black people what they have to lose by voting for him , since democratic policies have supposedly failed them . it 's not a genuine attempt to win black voters . it 's a way to win white conservatives who want reassurance he 's not a racist . nuances : i believe that even the best spun version of this story demonstrates a complete lack of integrity on warren 's part . it was wrong even if she did n't receive special considerations in her career . it was wrong even if there was some arbitrary in-law issues between her parents ' families . it was wrong , even if she never technically claimed to be a card carrying cherokee . some opinion articles ( mostly written by white progressives ) are framing this as a mistake where warren simply screwed up by trying to fight back against trump . i think trump is irrelevant . this issue exists in a vacuum outside of the current political climate . she made her bed decades ago , and has kept up the charade even today . usually i 'd assume ignorance over malice , but this is especially disappointing because warren has positioned herself as a progressive who knows better . this revelation about her thought process calls into question many other details about her life . for example , she claims she grew up at the lower edge of middle class . is that another white lie to better frame her rags to riches story ? note , i 'm not disputing her accomplishments and the challenges she overcame to achieve them . also , i freely admit that being a professional woman in the late 60s onward was a challenging experience . that being said , being a white middle class child in america in the 1950s was an incredible privilege that even white middle class people today ca n't relate to . given that europe was still recovering from wwii , and newly independant , but formerly colonized countries like india , pakistan , china , etc. were dealing with widespread poverty and hunger , the middle class in the us was able to achieve incredible wealth ( easily enough to be in the global 1 % at the time ) . to put it another way , for decades , the sat was written and refined to capture the writing style of middle class white american people like warren . i find the entire concept of "" racial purity testing "" to be "" problematic . "" this has several implications . first , i think warren screwed up by using the 21st century version of this kind of test . but more importantly , i dispute the one-drop rule , where one-drop of sub-saharan african blood meant a person was black . i dispute it on principle , but i also dispute it in the way elizabeth warren has claimed it applies to her . i believe she has lived a life complete with all the trappings of a white middle class american lifestyle . i do n't think she personally faced any challenges that come with being a member of a marginalized racial minority group . i do n't anyone would have even thought about it for a moment or associated her with it if she had n't brought it up herself . she has inverted this despicable vestige of old school american racism and used it for personal and political ( if not financial ) gain without once facing the challenges associated with that status . as a final point , i despise donald trump . i frequently criticize republicans for turning a blind eye to his crimes in pursuit of "" winning . "" i think democrats owe the same critical eye to elizabeth warren , who is the leading candidate for the democratic 2020 nomination . if warren issues a heartfelt apology , clarifies a detail that invalidates my argument , or otherwise moves past this issue in a satisfactory way , that 's great . otherwise , i think it 's the responsibility of anyone who cares about social justice in any meaningful way beyond lip service to support other candidates in the 2020 primary .","according to her bio , "" warren has described her family as teetering "" on the ragged edge of the middle class "" and "" kind of hanging on at the edges by our fingernails "" , and "" when she was 12 , her father , a salesman at montgomery ward , had a heart attack , which led to many medical bills as well as a pay cut because he could not do his previous work eventually , their car was repossessed because they failed to make loan payments . to help the family finances , her mother found work in the catalog order department at sears . is there any evidence she has used her native american ancestry to present herself with a "" rags to riches "" story ? it seems to me that she has such a story , but it has nothing to do with being native american , nor did she ever claim to be one . well she did call out trump on refusing to give a $ 1 million donation to a native american charity . white middle class people today make more than white middle class people in the 1950s . further , trump 's privilege is far greater than warren 's , since he was the son of a multimillion-dollar real estate developer in new york city , and a man to boot . i do n't think this should be a rule , but if mostly white people want to identify with their mixed-race heritage , i see that as a good thing , not a bad thing . the more people recognize their mixed race heritage , the more we 'll realize strict dividing lines by race are bullshit . even if you maintain your view on all of the above , you ca n't state this last line unless you show that the other candidates do n't have problems in themselves , which many of them do . i think you 're going to have to find some evidence of warren actually framing herself as a victim in order for your viewpoint to make sense . as far as i know , warren never actually tried to use her ancestry to get any benefits . yes , she represented herself a certain way when sharing her perspective , because what she was taught about her ancestry informed that perspective . father could n't work as a used car salesman when she was a kid , because of a heart attack . many people in america had these similar stories about their family . up until the recent genetic testing sites , it was n't possible to check it , so you tended to believe what you were told - parents told you they came from ireland + germany and had some native american in your family . i have n’t seen evidence of warren “ checking off ” the native american box when asked about her race on any paperwork . and while i agree what she ’s doing is a form of racism , i do n’t think it ’s exclusively a liberal thing how much of warren 's framing of her upbringing as "" being on the edge "" of middle class has anything to do with whether or not she is part-native american . the truth is that you 're not going to find a lot of people from oklahoma at elite northeastern colleges , and the ones that do end up there are usually wealthy people whose parents were there to work in oil or something like that . that she is a woman , who dropped out to get married , etc all are things that make her story all the more exceptional and having nothing to do with being american . i have n't really seen any evidence that she presented herself as native american to portray herself as a victim . if she was part native american , and had never spoken a word about it , could n't we see that of evidence of her wanting to deny her ancestry in order to better fit in her new elite circles ? keep in mind a lot has changed over the years , so back when she originally identified as na , it was n't necessarily so celebrated to belong to a minority group . this could just as easily be seen as native american pride . lots of americans have hazy claims about native american ancestry . spend a lot of time in qualla boundary , learned some of the language etc because he thought for 50 years it was his ancestry , based on visiting his grandmother as a child whose house was filled with cherokee artifacts . my guess is that closer you are to oklahoma , which has a relatively large na population , the more people who will believe they are part native american with no proof . warren has worked on behalf of native americans in her role as a senator . all that said , i do think there is some push within liberal circles , or in universities , for students to find a way to identify with a marginalized group , and it probably results in people really searching to make some connection ( i.e , my grandmother was an immigrant from ireland so i understand refugees ) in a way that ends up being insulting to people who really do belong to marginalized groups . to understand where warren was coming from when she claimed native american heritage you would have to understand oklahoma , her birth place . many people here claim native american heritage ( including myself ) because their parents told them they are and so they grew up accepting it . oklahoma history is native american history and many people here have at least a fraction of native american blood . my great grandmother was full blood shawnee , but i have fair skin and blue eyes , like my mother and grandfather . my cousins have black hair and brown eyes like their mother and grandmother . we carry the same percentage of native american blood , but i would be laughed at by most people in this country by claiming it and they would be taken seriously . taking my own experiences into account , i do n’t believe warren is racist because my experience is similar , which is growing up being told you have native american heritage and identifying with that and i also do n’t believe she meant to trick her way into college by claiming that heritage . i ’m sure there are many conservatives here that feel different , but i can only relate my personal experiences as an oklahoman . okay , first let us begin by considering what is meant by racism , utilising an online definition as "" an action or set of actions directed against someone of another race based upon there own belief that there race is superior "" . for the sake of argument let us suggest that warren Falsely chose to represent her race ( i will discuss the problem with this assumption in a later parapgraph ) . i do n't believe you have clearly demonstrated that warren actions were driven by the hatred or predujice to another group based upone race , you have utilised examples of hate groups acting as victims , however filling in university forms and a cook book does n't seem to be a comparable example . this does n't suggest that the action taken by warren are morally wrong or right , but utilising the concept of racism to address them seems flawed , so start with a simpler statement , for example consider this simpler statement , warren should not utilise a race she does not belong to for personal benefit ? utilising skin colour would be horiffically racist , let us take the example of black british people travelling in america who are often misidentified as african american . or a further example of somone who has lived in another country there entire life , yet originate from another country , there is no definite line , there is no exact point , race is fluid evolving , defining it based upon genetics or other factors is impossible , it is in the end a social construct utilised to draw in people and create groups , nothing more and nothing less . thus you now have to proove that warren lied from her perspective on those forms , she has stated that her family told her stories of native american ancenstory , which she may have believed , is it possible that she utilised this as an advantage while applying for one of the most competitive law schools in the world , well yes , but that also does n't mean it is False . finally you have to consider the context of the genetic test , it was taken only after she was directly insulted by donald trump , stating that she was lying about her heritage , what other actions can she carry out in this case , considering this is the man she is running against in 2020 ( most likely ) , is she simply meant to ignore him , endless reporting over and over again , as he is bound to . or can she utilise this test which demonstrates that at one point she had ancenstors who were native americans , as a tool against a man who will lie constantly , state False news . do n't people need to stand up to trump with every piece of information , every piece of facts as otherwise 2020 may be a repeat of 2016 . but in the end is this the major marker of her character , should she not be judged on the rest of her life , on her policies , on her stated beliefs , in the end it is your right to judge what you deem important within your politicians , i would be interested as why this would be a major focus of yours . in summary , i do n't think you have demonstrated a clear link to racism or have clearly shown that warren did lie about her race and moreover in my opinion there are far more important factors in supporting a politican , such as there policies and past legeslative work and voting patterns . warren has never claimed to be native american , but rather part native american based , and that ’s been proven to be True . and i also think a lot of the information you present here as fact is n’t really a fact ( such as warren identifying herself as native american in college ) . there ’s nothing wrong with that , especially since there ’s no evidence she ’s ever used that to get benefits or play a victim in any situation . it was my understanding also that due to so few native americans using 23 and me or w.e. that they cant get an accurate percentage of heritage currently . i never heard of this woman before this week , and she disgusts me . i 'm sure there would be an uproar over that 1 % of black blood she would claim to have . our voices are not as loud as the black community . while i agree with you that many people , especially in the college application process , check the minorities box to get ahead despite having none of the challenges , that 's not what she 's doing here . so if thirty years down the line we finally get some recognition for our challenges , does that make my current lack of support in dealing with systemic discrimination invalid ? i 've been discriminated against every step of my life , yet i still check that asian box because that 's what i believe my heritage to be , largely because i am a first generation immigrant . she had probable cause to believe she was native american . i would certainly agree that liberals are as prone to racism as anyone else , but i fail to see how elizabeth warren specifically goes beyond the pale with this . for example , if i have a co-worker who only drinks guinness and talks about his proud irish heritage constantly , even though he ’s only 1/16th irish and no relative he ’s ever met has ever even been to ireland , is that also emblematic of insidious racism ? i think of it as a somewhat uniquely american yearning to connect with our roots , since most of us are of at least somewhat mixed heritage , with a lineage that only goes back a few generations before it changes continents . current polling puts biden at 33 % favorability for 2020 and warren in the single digits behind bernie sanders and kamala harris . op , if my great great great great grandmother was cherokee and the women in my family had passed it down as a point of pride for generations , i would certainly call myself part indian . i 'm not arguing for or against your point , but if you 're not happy with her justifications for her claims , you need to establish what you feel should be the minimum requirements for a claim like this to be valid . there are at least two ways of looking at non tribal members with native ancestry : cultural appropriation vs. cultural shame . many of us who pass as only caucasian have ancestors who came out of the orphanages . they were taken from their parents and never learned anything about their own language and culture . they were forced to act white , and spent their lives doing their best to pass as white . their children , and grandchildren , and great grandchildren grew up surrounded by white culture , and never knew anything about their heritage . given that , is it worse to keep up the lie and pretend that ancestor was never stolen away and forced to live a lie ? or is it worse to claim that heritage openly , when it is so diluted so as to be almost invisible , and not a trace of shared culture remains ? there is a part of me that wants to knock on the door and say , “ your child was stolen from you . by coming here , i return them to you , that your family - our family - can be made whole . ” but there is another part of me that winces at all the thought . claim the ancestry openly and proudly , but do n’t claim tribal citizenship . and i ’m not going to contact the tribe without permission from my other relatives , and it ’s an awkward question to bring up . it ’s not that i feel the cultures i currently identify with are lacking and i need something more , and it ’s not that i think i ’m lying if i do n’t mark down that native american ancestry on forms . the bloodline exists ; i want to be proud of my native ancestor , who had a pretty amazing life , not act like i ’m ashamed of them and denying their existence . reading through some of your responses ; it seems you determine a persons culture based on , what i would call , a "" nature or nurture "" scenario . if you were born a certain race ( predominantly ) or raised in that culture ( no matter your majority racial characteristics ) then you get to make the claim that you are of that race/culture . now , in this case with elizabeth warren , it actually sounds a fair bit like my own familial heritage . supposedly , my maternal great grandfather was a native american man from south dakota . nobody really has much idea of that family line , as many died early in their lives and my grandmother refused to speak about her past much . considering that i am a "" white mutt "" with ties to at least five countries in europe who immigrated to the us , what makes this native american ancestry of mine any more or less valid ? additionally , i was n't raised swedish or german or french or ect ... anymore than i was raised as a native american . i just grew up as an "" american "" , which is just as much of a hodgepodge culture as my bloodline . as far as i can tell , she 's done nothing insidious or made any claims to having a minority status . as i see it , she 's free to identify with whatever part of her heritage that she likes . i think all any of this debacle around a persons race is just a sign of how we put some things on a pedestal , to everyone 's demerit . instead of calling it "" racial purity testing "" , i prefer to think of it as "" societal cannibalism "" where people just can not stop trying to pull everyone else down . if i understand correctly , what prompted you to write so much on this subject is that , at some point in the 90s , that woman checked a box about having native ancestry . trumps learns about this and thinks its a good way to discredit her since she appears quite white . verdict : her implication with the cookbook indicates that she relates on some level to natives . through all this , she did make a statement about her status : she has personal consideration american natives due to her ancestry . i do n't understand how this can make anyone perceive her as a victim to which affirmative action is due . she benefited by being perceived as someone who can relate to natives due to her personal attention to some aspects of the culture , albeit minor . asking for a "" heartfelt apology "" about a detail in a form from a few decades ago is ridiculous . having this kind of absurd goalpost seems like a way to trick yourself into not liking her on "" virtuous "" grounds while your main issue with the woman probably lies somewhere else . to me , it seems a if you seized this detail about elizabeth warrens to discuss the broader topic , even though it did n't quite fit . i dislike that some people are brainwashed into hating gays , oppressing woman and spreading this ideology . warren said she did n’t approve the school using her background to talk about minority status and that she did n’t remember talking about her heritage with the school , especially during the hiring process . other officials at the school backed her up that her heritage was n’t part of hiring conversations . she did not know that her native american ancestry was so minimal . the only reason it 's a thing is because scott brown , her opponent for the senate seat , made a big deal about it . you 're gon na need some sources , because i follow everything warren puts out , and i have n't seen any of the things you 're upset with her for , other than the fact that she was a white person who bought too much into their family stories of being native american , which hardly seems worth calling her a racist over . it sounds like she did something as simple as checking a box decades ago , and she 's never made it a major part of her platform . reading wikipedia ( -- url -- ) , it sounds like she 's never wanted to make it a major part of her image , and in fact , my reading of her non-affiliation with her tribe is that she would rather make the issue go away entirely . even if you could make the case that she should n't have done that , is n't this whole thing just a big distraction from the fact that she has the most radical , yet practical ideas about the economy out of any major us political figure today ? both of her opponents have been bashing her , she had been able to trace lineage to her great-great-great-grandmother as being partially na previously and now had the data to back it up . not sure if you 're from mass or have seen some of the crass ( and poorly photoshopped ) campaign ads her independent opponent for senate has been running . he probably does n't have a snowballs chance in hell of winning , especially running on a 3rd party ticket ... but he can easily help to split the ballot as a spoiler candidate , and even her r-opponent has been saying the same , although to a lesser degree . tl ; dr : it 's an election year and she 's facing attack ads on both sides . she does n't want to be the weak woman who lays down and takes it , especially in this political environment . i would n’t consider a women who grew up in the 50s as privileged . it honestly looks like this all started with harvard mislabeling her for their own gain , in the 1980s with pressure to show a diverse staff . she never used her verbal family history of "" some native american descent "" to any gain ! why is it wrong to make statements like "" my mother told me x. "" you never state in your post . you ca n't just blanket say talking about race is wrong and not back it up.how deep down the rabbit hole have we gone if someone is criticized for such a vapid statement such as , "" i hold some genetics from a minority group . "" she stated she held some genetics from native americans , and now you are telling her she has to go meet with tribal leaders and show she cares about that group and do who knows what else . perhaps relatively she was privileged , but women were and are still struggling . particularly in that era in that part of the country . first , none of the claims you make appear to have valid sources . there is ambiguity with a few , in terms of who made decisions to call her things and outright denial by all parties for others . second , the aspects of what she did that are not in dispute , to me , show a pride in her heritage rather then taking advantage of the situation . the only question i have concerns your statement "" defends against accusations with phrases like "" islam is not a race .

9ox32p,"modern-day feminism ( third wave ) seeks to break the social contract between man and woman , negate the positive qualities of both the masculine and the feminine , and has no plan to reconcile the two parties . ( this is not a post about the legitimacy of women ’s rights . ) the best of man is brought forth when he applies himself . this dedication and fervor is due , in part , to the love he might feel towards a woman . abraham lincoln succeeded at his best once he found the love of his life . napoleon ’s military victories came to an end after he put josephine aside . even leonardo da vinci ’s greatest work are due to the beauty he saw in mona lisa , though he himself many suspect did not lean toward the heterosexual tendencies . it is common knowledge that a married man will be more motivated to earn more than bachelors , and that they do earn more . there have been many examples throughout history of men making use of what is referred to as this “ transmuted sex energy ” to further their ambitions and goals . most likely it harkens back to a time primordial were the cave man was most inclined to prove he was a worthy mate by providing for the female . this is not a goal he strives for himself . it is to provide for her . his own individual is a secondary part to the goal he wishes to achieve . for if he is not able to provide for the female there is no possible way he may foster a family with her . this has to be his contribution to the social contract between the sexes . in furthering modern-day feminism , the movement has forgotten to reconcile the masculine form with the feminine , instead seeking to nullify its existence and influence . the aggression the male form has to survive the unknown beasts of the wild , indeed his ‘ toxic masculinity ’ is a necessary evil when circumstances require it . the knee-jerk reaction to this statement brings up unpleasant imagery of despicable acts men perform on women . however , these extremes do not represent the whole . one does not characterize the whole of islam as a religion of terror for the work of a few , neither should all of men be chastised by the deeds of a few . one can argue that this text seeks to do so with the radical feminist , however the prevalence of the aversion to masculinity is more wide spread than the aversion to say islam – indeed the negative aspects of islam are correlated to masculinity . therefore , it can not be considered a generalization of the small representing the whole . especially when the normal advocates of feminism still demur the attributes of masculinity . having said this , one should point out that one of the conditions of the social contract is that the man should maintain civility of mind in the presence of the female form , to not do so would undermine the rules of the contract – provide and protect the female form . however , the radical feminist symbolically castrates the man for being a man . this will have a detrimental effect on society as a whole and should be avoided . it is of pivotal importance to the worth of a man that he acts like a man . otherwise he has nothing to contribute in regards to the contract . it is then a responsibility for the woman to provide this image within the man ’s mind for which he struggles and fights . if she revokes her responsibility on this point , the man will not be inclined to provide for her , their family or potential family , and - in due course - society . he will avoid his responsibility if is she avoids hers . it also entails a responsibility to be an honest partner , to not use and manipulate one another for one ’s own goals . this would breach the contract that a successful relationship strives for . indeed , men who sleep around can do so , in part , to the fact that this contract is being undermined by feminism . if the contract was in play , a man who is unfaithful ( likewise a woman ) would be avoided and the social environment would stir clear of them - hopefully . however , with the proclamation that women should be free to express their sexuality , the contract is void to begin with . from this point it can be argued that the traits we attribute to the feminine form , that of beauty , grace , kindness , that which gives the man the deeper feeling that there is something within this world worth fighting for , must be maintained . her worth to the contract is maintained by how she acts like a woman . in negating the role of the mother , feminism removes the incentive for the man , and the wheel of civilization stops turning . this is not to say that she may not exhibit herself in masculine ways , the determined and aggressive woman who leads the way in , for example , a company can still elicit the adulation of man as much as the loving mother . as can the creative and expressive man , with his words and prose for example , provide for the woman . however , several women 's activists have voiced their opinion on this matter and state that modern-day ( third wave ) feminism does more harm than good . to the point were common assumptions of what it means to be a woman are somehow negative to attribute to a woman . indeed , appreciating the female form for what it is , is somehow negative in this modern circumstance as it points out that they are not male . it is somehow only accepted in the doctrine of modern-day feminism to behave in a feminine way if one is a man , and to behave in a masculine way if one is a woman . to do as your nature compels you to would be strict heresy . to sum up , modern day feminism does more to break this contract than it does to maintain it . not only does it chastise men for their masculinity but it seeks to undermine the feminine form . and it has no way of actually bringing the two parties together , where one party is n’t in complete domination over the other . together the masculine and feminine create a symbiosis which nurtures the family – in a macrocosm the man and the woman – together – nurtures society . this is the foundation of the social contract . if seeking equality of the sexes is just that , then why does modern-day feminism try to change the roles around and disregard the natural contract between man and woman ? if it were a movement to truly see the equality of the sexes then it would appreciate their differences and see that their most admirable parts were brought forth . change my view .","sir isaac newton died a virgin and he was very driven all his life . nicola tesla , j edgar hoover or hans christian andersen did as well . they all were driven in their life , none of them needed a women to "" push them further "" . has nothing to do with women or the social contract . sex does not magically transform you into a better person - someone who is poor with time management , lacks the will to learn , and does not consider others in social situations will not magically become a socially-adept , agile-minded master of time management just because he has sex or is pursuing a woman . like any motivator , sex can spur someone towards a specific goal , but to say that this specific motivator is somehow necessary to reach a man 's full potential does not mesh with reality , unless you arbitrarily define "" is in a relationship with a woman "" into the definition of "" full potential . "" also this does not account for relationships between gay men , or lesbian women , who have successful careers . if he is unable to justify his existence outside of his relationship with "" the female , "" then there is little reason for "" the female "" to want to "" foster a family "" with him in the first place . if your only offering is that you are of the "" correct "" gender , then you do n't have much to offer at all to separate you from anyone else who can offer the exact same thing ( nearly 50 % of the human race ) . insofar as you define "" the masculine "" as "" lacking drive in existence outside of the context of a sexual relationship , "" i unequivocally agree that this should be nullified . if only one side agrees to it , it 's not a "" contract . "" by this logic , slavery was a "" social contract "" because one side expected it of the other and used force to back it up . what does it mean to you to "" act like a man ?

& #x200b ; & #x200b ; & #x200b ; & #x200b ; tl : dr you buy land , gov. taxes annually , you do n't pay , gov. takes your land = you rent land from gov. & #x200b ; i would be thrilled if my view was changed .","what you want is called allodial title and only the us is crazy enough to allow this , see the wikipedia link for a description of how obtaining allodial title in nevada works . almost everywhere , if not everywhere onnearth you 'll pay property tax . it is much much lower than renting prices would be , so the difference in amounts would make it a very improbable renting price . and you pay that tax and you get something in return for it . in short you could conclude that : one : your land is protected from being stolen by others , the deed us in your name and the government will enforce your claim to it from other people . so the nations defences ( the military ) will protect it 's borders and land , which includes your land . if not , any other nation could swoop in , take your land by force and you 'll have no way to stop them . offcourse this is in no way complete or a full legal explaination , but it might give you an idea why you are paying the government a fee for your land . like you seem to have a moral objection to property taxes specifically and what it 's ramifications are for ownership . your land has roads leading to it and some infrastructure given to it . if you do not pay homage to that system , through taxes , a man with a gun comes and takes it away . the same way a business might liquidate stock to pay off bills . the business pays its bills or the debtors take its stuff . what you have is something of value ( land ) and a debit owed ( taxes ) . but eventually that land will be absorbed by our sun as it turns into a red giant . if you really wanted to "" buy buy "" land you would have to set up your own country and buy land in the same sense that us bought alaska . but even that would not be quarantee of rights , it would just be contingent on diplomatic relationships ( if the us decided to annex your land there is no hard authority to complain to at most you could get other countries to condem the us ) . other property beside lands does not unconditionally remain with you . i am pretty sure if you fail to pay taxes your posessions will forcibly get converted to cover them . if you fail to pay taxes , and the government takes your land , it 's not stealing by you your own definition . the meaning of "" stealing from you "" in the us is that the us government will enforce your rights to the land you own using its police , courts and military . this is a meaning everyone has to accept , because nobody has the power to ignore or oppose those systems , and so the continued operations of the us government are the very thing that allows you to own your land . and , every person who owns anything pays taxes to the state . think of ownership as a service you pay for , and the government a business that in exchange for an yearly fee guarantees that you can make use of your property continuously . if you dont pay your taxes , and your land is your only resource , sure , the government can take it ... but usually the tax is negligible compared to the land 's worth and for them to take it you will have to accumulate quite a debt but in most people would still consider using the word "" own "" to owning a property that could be taken from you if you do n't pay your property taxes . there 's already a precedent for what property tax is that makes much more sense than rent ... it 's a utility bill or hoa fee . a non-optional one , to be sure , but it 's the regular price you pay for the utilities provided by governance . having elected to live on property that is a part of your national "" homeowner 's association "" ( because it 's within the borders ) , you contribute towards the pool of money that provides for the common governance of those who dwell there . hoa fees are not rent , but if you do n't pay them then your property can eventually be seized and sold off , because not paying your membership fees is theft of services . that aside , you 've expressed that you might be fine with property taxes if you could just pay them all at once and not worry about them in perpetuity . that 's not how upkeep costs work , but nevertheless it 's actually not that hard to get such a mechanism set up via a trust . you just need enough money in stable investments to pay out dividends that will cover the costs in perpetuity . for instance , i owe about $ 5,000 annually in property taxes , if i was to put aside a quarter of a million dollars ( $ 250,000 ) in government bonds at 2 % , the interest accrued on that money could probably pay my property taxes forever . in most cases people do n't do this because you 're basically doubling the up-front cost of your property ( depending on where you live ) and that money could get you much better return if invested elsewhere ."
9ow87x,"vegans would have a better impact on supporting the welfare of animals in the food industry by supporting businesses and farms that treat their animals humanely if someone ’s reason for becoming a vegan is the welfare of animals in the food industry , would it not be more effective to support the smaller businesses and farms that are trying to do it right - all while working against the market ? if the only people that care enough about animals to make a change boycott the industry altogether , are they not paving the way for bigger , inhumane businesses and farms to dominate the market even more than they already do ? i understand this does not deal with the environmental factors of animals in the food industry . i ’m talking more about animal cruelty . there are definitely businesses and farms out there that treat their animals with the upmost respect . there are too few vegans to boycott the meat , dairy , and other animal product industries effectively . this would only mean the people that supposedly do n’t care about animals are the only people left effecting the market . surely these people will go for the cheapest options , which are usually provided through inhumane farming . i argue it would be more effective to support farms and businesses that take care and respect their animals by buying and consuming their products , even though they are usually more expensive . again this would only apply to people who became vegan for the sole reason of boycotting animal cruelty within the food industry .","vegans are such a tiny percentage of the population that they could never constitute enough of the market share to influence more humane practices . their market share is so small that without even looking at hard numbers it ’s pretty clear the industry would n’t justify using more humane ( expensive ) practices to get those new customers . so yeah at best you might get some humane high priced specialty meet sellers but the only ones who are going to care enough to pay the higher price are the vegans . if the general consumer cared enough the market would ’ve already shifted to more humane conditions . so all you ’ve done is get more animals killed . sure they ’ll be treated more humanely then other animals but again without the vegans buying the meat they would n’t have been bred and killed in the first place "" do n't you eat that really expensive beef from the local market ? "" "" so you 're not a vegan then ? "" and this is how every conversation along those lines would go - people have tried to convince me i 'm not vegetarian because i pick at my own nails , could you imagine a die hard vegan actually eating meat ? and even a carefully crafted explanation as to why would end in the same question , because people love ripping into vegans too much . besides which , most vegans would argue that there is no way to humanely take an animal 's life , regardless of how well they 're treated during it . there 's no humane way of milking a cow , because while you 're milking it it 's either trapped in a box or a field and does n't get any say in it . you ca n't have free range eggs because no one in industry truly does free range - if they 've tried , they 've already gone out of business . i have seen vegans getting fresh eggs from places like sanctuaries or even chickens they 've rescued themselves , but that 's about it . supporting small , "" more humane "" industry is still supporting the industry , as some of the money going to the farmers etc you want to support will go to the slaughterhouse they used , other farmers they 've traded/bred with , and any other less ethical places they 've had dealings with . and whichever way you look at it , if you 're supporting a cow farmer , you 're supporting the killing of cows . this does n't mean vegans have to shout about it and make a huge fuss over everyone else doing it - some do because it 's how they try to make a difference to those animals , but even just not paying into the industry is better than paying a large amount of money for most likely worse tasting meat all in the name of supporting someone who was nicer to his animals until he stacked them up in a small trailer and drove them to the nearest death box . because welfare standards are undefined in such a way that "" free range "" chickens only means that there can be no more than 5 chickens per square meter , and because i ca n't physically see the act of killing in a supposedly "" humane "" farm to see if i do actually find it morally ok , i abstain from animal products completely . if i ca n't absolutely guarentee that there was zero harm in that animals life and that the death was instant , ie "" humane "" , i would rather just get myself a veggie burger . on an industrial scale , i think truly humane killing is impossible in any case so a society that only eats "" ethical "" meat is even more unlikely than a totally vegan world forgive me for the lengthy reply , but this is an issue that many people wrestle with ( vegans and non-vegans alike ) so i think it warrants some attention . i think the issue is that many people seem to be looking at the problem from the top-down ; of course one person is going to appear to not be making much of a difference if you 're looking at the animal agriculture industry as a whole . we discuss what we should do and realize that if we go back to shore for help , they will all drown by the time help arrives . should we leave because we ca n't save them all and saving one or two of them wo n't make that big of a difference , or should we try to save the one or two that we can ? this could be extended to environmental causes as well ; should each of us do what we can to lower our impact on the environment , or should we just feel free to spew greenhouse gasses and pollutants as much as we can since a single individual ca n't change the entire system ? even from the top-down , there are major and observable changes happening with the food industry , and these changes are happening at an increasing pace . just 20 or so years ago , not many people had even heard the term vegan . the markets have adapted as the demand for more vegetarian and vegan options has grown . not only is soy milk available in almost every town , but many areas now have multiple varieties and brands of cashew milk , almond milk , rice milk , oat milk , and coconut milk . a vegan mayo has taken away so much market share from the major players that that it even caught the attention of the president of the american egg board , who called the product "" a major threat to the future of the egg product business . "" the faux meat industry has grown from selling a handful of low-quality unappetizing product to a huge range of high-quality plant-based meats . vegan substitute companies like beyond meat and hampton creek are attracting huge investors like bill gates . even major fast-food and restaurant chains tout the fact that they have vegetarian and vegan options . taco bell regularly advertises their meat-free options and the fact that they have menu items certified by the american vegetarian association . fast-casual burrito chains like chipotle , pancheros , and moe 's have begun offering sauteed or grilled tofu as a protein option right alongside their meat options . even white castle has had a vegan burger on their menu ( link2 ) , and white castle have recently rolled-out impossible sliders to all of their locations . the pizza chains mod pizza , blaze pizza and & pizza offer a vegan cheese option for every pizza . most other chains have made an effort to include at least a few vegan or vegetarian options on the menu , even if it 's just a simple veggie burger . there have even been some completely vegan chain restaurants emerge with locations around the us , like native foods and veggie grill . u.s. vegetarian food sales , which is a category that includes things like soy milk and faux meat and not simply produce , doubled between 1998 and 2003 . in 2016 , tyson foods ( one of the largest players in the meat industry in the world ) announced that they are investing in plant-based meat-alternatives , and bought stake in a vegan meat company . in 2018 , when asked why they invested in beyond meat , a spokesperson for tyson said : "" we are a consumer products group and we sell delicious food to people all around the world , and as consumer 's preferences change and diets change , it 's our responsibility to go where the customers are going to be . "" in the uk , the rate of veganism has gone up by over 360 % over the past decade , and vegan food sales have risen by 1500 % in the last year . in 2017 , canadian meat-producer maple leaf foods bought a stake in lightlife foods , a company that produces plant-based vegan meat products , due to the increased demand for these types of products . later in the year , they bought field roast , another company specializing in plant-based meats and cheeses . marketwired reports , “ growth of alternative protein sources is poised to accelerate , potentially claiming up to a third of the protein market by 2054 , profoundly affecting agriculture , food technology , and end products , according to lux research . ” in 2017 , cargill , the largest privately held food and agriculture company in the world and one of the largest beef producers in the us , sold off its feedlot operations to divert funds to expand into other protein options , including plant-based proteins . in 2017 , at a dairy industry conference in chicago , the ceo of select milk producers said "" i think the threat is very serious , "" in reference to plant-based milks taking market share away from conventional dairy-based milk . 2017 , tgi fridays restaurants started offering the plant-based "" beyond burger "" at all of its locations . 2017 , pizza hut starts offering vegan cheese at all of their uk locations . 2017 , baum & whiteman food & restaurant consultants identified plant-based ( vegan ) food as the # 1 trend for the industry to plan for in 2018 . it 's clear that the millions and millions of vegetarians and vegans in the world have made a difference . now , i am not a vegan nor a vegetarian , but ... for meat it 's pretty obvious , no matter how great their life on the farm is , they get killed at the end . for milk products it 's already a bit more complicated , you 'd have to take the calf away from the mother . remember , it 's not a choice between either supporting "" cruel meat "" companies or "" nice meat "" companies . rather , it 's a choice between support "" cruel meat "" , "" nice meat "" , or "" non-meat "" . it 's hard to see how taking money away from plant-based companies to support "" nice meat "" companies would somehow result in improved animal welfare . it 's also worth point out that , sadly , the realities of our economy make "" nice meat "" or "" nice dairy "" somewhat unrealistic . allowing animals to live to their natural life span , free range captivity , enrichment , allowing calves to stay with their mothers , not keeping dairy cows in a state of near-pregnancy ... these basic welfare steps would immediately raise the cost of meat or dairy to prices that are simply unmarketable . this simply is n't True , although it is True that the size of the ' effect ' ( in ' effectively ' ) is small . vegans can and do allow the creation of plant-based products and companies . a sustained income stream of vegan customers convinces companies to offer more ( and better ! ) the near-future prospect of lab grown meat is a good example of this : it 's not unreasonable to think that the vegan market , while small , was instrumental in encouraging research in this area , and if these meat replacement products go on to substantially replace animal products in the future , it will be in no small part due to the purchasing power of vegans today . in other words , the goal of veganism "" here and now "" is n't so much to single-handedly take down the entire meat industry sometime next year , but merely encourage a slight shift in the market share . every vegan : 0 animals used for human consumption ( and other products ) even if you could established something you consider "" humane "" it would still be breeding , caging , butchering animals . since 0 will always be less than x , a vegan has a bigger impact ."

9ot8ms,"there is no definitive point in time where we can say that racism ended in america . it used to be more common for people to imply that racism ended in the united states sometime in the recent past . some would refer to the events that took place in the 1960s as the point where everything evened out and past prejudices and racism were all reconciled . to say the least things have changed . not only in the sense that fewer people deny that racism exists but also that the way we understand racism has changed . racism is now understood as structural , systematic as well as prejudice and bigotry . how ever you interpret its meaning , we are no longer in a time where people flat out deny the existence of racism , instead we debate over the definition or who is more racist . i argue that progress away from racism in the america is superficial and that racism never ended .","still , what most pundits consider racism ended a while back . it 's also hard to argue the country is still "" racist "" considering we have had ( and still have ) black ceos , politicians , as black president , and the entertainment and sports industries are dominated by black men . if you are arguing that racism at all still exists , you would be correct . we had the wasps ( white anglo saxon protestants ) prothletising white genocide ( and by white , they meant northern european protestants ) , not jjsut from the supposed threat of black people , but also from the new immigrants who came from southern and eastern europe as well as ireland . none of these people were considered white , and the wasps would not sell or rent them property anywhere outside of the ghettos because other wasps didnt want them living near them and property value would be lowered , so they were stuck in crowded , over priced lead poisoned slums , generally suffering in poverty with no help from the government . the wasps not only exaggerated the levels of crime , they blamed it on something inherent within the new immigrants , as part of their ethnicity . the wasps blamed them for not leaving the ghetto , despite having nowhere else to go , they were accused of being lazy and hopeless . the wasps also held great suspicion toward asian americans , who despite often being born in the us orr having fled their nation of birth due to dictatorship and oppresion , were deemed to have in built allegiance to japan and so were banned from owning farms , land , getting certain jobs , voting , and later thrown into internment camps . it did n't help that all these minorities , having closer ties to their parents country or their own country of birth , were not far removed from the dictatorships they 'd fled , and so were much more skeptical of the government or blind patriotism , following of the status quo , some would engage in activism or join workers unions ... no good for the corporate elite at the time , and far too socialist ... even then the red scare was well under way , anyone who was n't a wasp must be a communist sympathiser . all these things parrallell today , from the populism of trump and wilson , scapegoating asians then and now muslims , trans people , gay people , systematically forcing minorities into ghettos , gentrification , massive tax cuts for the rich , once again prothletising a white genocide . isolationism can easily turn into facism from what i can see in history , though im not that well read tbh . you can point to an exact date state sponsored racism or racist policies ended in the usa . to further curb some of these abstract notions of racism like unconscious bias or whatever else requires authoritarianism and tyranny . america has made a lot of progress over the past 50 years , but there are a lot of people who do in fact deny racism even exists today ."

9oramy,"the metoo movement does more harm to assault/harassment victims than help . first : let me make it very clear that this is not a pro-assault or pro-harassment view point , nor am i saying i believe any of these men / women are lying about being assaulted . that has nothing to do with my opinion at all . additionally , this is not meant to attack or shame any victim past , present or future . this is about those who have experienced assault , knew it would hurt them professionally and did not report it when something could actually have been done about it . a prime example of this ( and certainly not the only one ) would be most of harvey weinstein 's victims . so many women and girls . scores of women spanning decades . most of which went on to reap the benefits of his influence later . actresses , screenwriters , models , tv hosts , etc . i 'm betting a major reason no one spoke out about him is because they each had something to lose . which in this case is a career in show business . this was their biggest pay-off ( as well as an \ actual \ pay-off in some cases ) . so they did not speak out , they kept quiet and it continued to happen . to compound the fear and shame that comes along with a crime like this , they knew that their careers would suffer . so they said nothing . some of these women have admitted that they knew it was happening or had happened to other women . this is where the True harm comes in . but now , 20/30 + years later , after the benefits have been reaped , under the veil of strength and bravery , women are coming forward in droves crying about this injustice . and now its a "" movement "" that we are supposed to rally behind . everyone of these women have failed the women that came after them . making it harder and harder each time for them to come forward . the damage is done , there will be no proving this ever happened . he has gotten away with it , and each one of the women that did not come forward helped him , and those like him . i know , first hand , how bad it sucks to have to report a person of power who has taken advantage of me . i know it is difficult because i 've done it . this does not make be any more of a woman and i am not looking to start a movement . but as woman we all know that no one is going to stand up for us especially if we are n't willing to stand up for each other . i said something . i lost my job , i knew i would . but it is my sincere hope that i made it easier for the next woman to say something and in turn making it more difficult for him to do it again . granted , he is not harvey weinstein , but that does not make my fear and shame at the time any less . it does not help for a millionaire actress to come forward and say she was assaulted 30 years ago . my young daughter who may look up to her can not use that . the outcry has lost it 's power . what she needs to see is women propping each other up in the now . not : this happened years ago and i have gone on to a fabulous career in the public spotlight . this does not take his power away . our children often ( way too often imo ) look up to these women as idols . our girls are seeing what can happen if you do n't speak up . i speak very candidly with my children about many things we see in the media . the only good thing i can see that has come of this in my household is i have been given another chance to talk to my kids about what is appropriate , what is not and no matter how hard something might be , you should always , always do what you feel in your heart-of-hearts to be right . should the women of long ago ( and certainly not just the alyssa 's and salma 's of the world ) have stood up for each other the conversation around the dinner tables of the country could be much different . i would rather be saying "" we can thank these women for being brave trailblazers "" not , "" yeah , they should have stood up for themselves and each other ""","if you frame metoo against that ideal world , i can see how you 'd see the movement as a net harm . the proper frame would be to look at what came before metoo : silence about abusers . given what 's happened , i think coming forward is much , much better than never coming forward at all . moreover , i think that coming forward later rather than never will encourage people to come forth sooner : it shows that women can be believed and makes it more clear to men that they will face social , career , or even criminal consequences for their actions . that 's the whole point of the movement - by coming forward now , more people are starting to come forward earlier than they would have in the past . i get what you 're saying , but the past is the past , and the fact that so many have come forward ( even when it 's relatively safe ) has shifted the way we all think . i 'd bet that , because of all of this , if someone walked into a hollywood producer 's hotel room and he pulled a weinstein , they 'd be a lot more likely to say something now - because people would believe them . i also think less men are doing things like this because it 's way more likely that someone will speak up . how do you propose we quantify it and measure it to reach a conclusion on the net impact of all the outcomes ? but is n't your view more harmful to sexual assault victims . the metoo movement is about getting women to come forward about when they were assaulted , to overcome the fear and shame that assault made them feel . that helps to not only highlight how frequent women are assault and how our culture has normalized it . but also to reassure future victims that if they speak up their are people who will listen . but your viewpoint seems to want to add shame to being assaulted . you are just putting some arbitrary timeline on when coming forward about sexual assault is good . you mention that you lost a job after you reported sexual harassment , but what about the women who ca n't afford to be fired from a job ? say a woman on probation that if she loses her job would end up going back to prison , does her story not have value because she told it anonymously through a metoo tweet ? a huge number of women had their careers hurt or outright derailed by weinstein . if your view is "" the women who were hurt earlier selfishly stayed silent so they could personally benefit , "" that 's just a downright incorrect belief . every #metoo post i saw on facebook was followed by women reaching out to support the victim . i think one important thing you are leaving out is how the overall political climate has changed over the past several decades . you could be right that a lot of women did a cost-benefit analysis and realized that they would be giving up opportunities to make money by sticking their neck out on principle – but in running that cost-benefit analysis , they probably understood that the chance of their claim being believed was much , much lower than it is now . is it selfish to wait until the tables have turned in our sexual politics such that society is ready to believe victims ? in my mind , it would n't be an ordinary , ethical choice to destroy your own career just to slightly budge social consciousness of sexual abuse ; rather , that would have been an extraordinarily brave and courageous thing to do , especially twenty or thirty years ago , and it does n't really seem fair to criticize some women for being practical instead of extraordinarily selfless . wrong , because she is a famous actress , your daughter knows who she is and looks up to her . therefore , seeing her come forward provides a powerful role model for speaking up . harvey weinstein is going to jail based on accusations made as part of #metoo . the fact that many more accusations have come to light because abused women have said they felt emboldened seeing other women come forward , is evidence that #metoo has changed the climate . you 'd have to be arguing that losing your career , going to jail , are not serious deterrents to men who might abuse in the future ."
9opx4j,"kneeling for the national anthem is not disrespectful . i personally have not served in the military , but both my grandfathers have served , my dad 's dad was a military police officer , and my mom 's grandfather was a navy officer during the korean war . my dad 's brother is a retired chief of police . and some of my friends from high school are serving right now . that being said , most people who go against the national anthem protest , have never served , not only that , but they act like players are doing this for no reason . like the police brutality , and racism in our country does n't exist . ignorance is bliss , and players are n't gon na stop because your feelings are hurt . cmv : kneeling for the national anthem is not disrespectful to the military , or veterans .","now - if the players were marching in front of the ferguson police station , that sends a pretty clear message . more to the point , should people be offended by an action ( regardless of the intention behind it ) or by the intention behind the action ( regardless of the despicableness of the action ) . take a look at the debate that periodically crops up surrounding the confederate battle flag . some people view it as a symbol of independence , regional heritage , family pride , etc. , which are all noble enough things to celebrate ( i.e. noble intention behind the action ) . other people view the confederate battle flag as a symbol of slavery , of divisiveness within the union of the united states , and of a failed rebellion ( despicableness of the action ) . and funnily enough , most of the people that want to condemn kneelers for their action 's inherent disrespect defend the confederate flag on the basis of intention . and many of the people that defend the kneelers because of the intentions condemn the confederate flag on it 's inherent symbolism . my problem is not that these players are not standing for the national anthem ; it 's that they are using a public stage , which is technically their place of work , in order to gain attention . a green beret asked kaep to kneel because he used to sit . even if you intend no disrespect , it can be valid for someone to perceive a symbol or phrase or action as disrespectful . people felt disrespected ( and for good reason , not trying to make that an issue ) , so intention did n't matter , or people assumed they knew what her intent was , no matter what she said . it 's perfectly valid to say that no disrespect is intended and that you personally ( as i personally ) feel it is n't disrespectful , but our common perception is n't objectively correct ."
9opwtg,"the #metoo movement makes men afraid and can harm innocent men i recently read an opinion post on the telegraph ( i believe - apologies if i 'm incorrect ) that talked about how the #metoo movement have made men afraid to "" make moves "" along with the kavanaugh case made me think more critically about the whole movement . up until this point i 've been fairly supportive of it with few criticisms of it . i should also probably mention that i personally think the base idea/concept of the #metoo movement is simply great . bringing attention to an issue that has for a long time been either considered taboo or been avoided . to this extent i agree with the message behind the movement . i think the men who have been exposed with good , reliable evidence deserves what they get in the aftermath . here are my two main problems with the movement : firstly like the opinion post suggested i believe that men have become a lot , lot more careful about the advances they 've made . sure , it could be argued that this is good and i 'd agree if that only applied to men who otherwise had intended harm or who would n't have understood the idea of taking it too far or men who simply disregard consent . my issue is the men who mean well , who are respectful of women and their rights , bodies , and limits . not only do i feel personally that global movements such ( mainly ) as #metoo have made not only myself , but other friends a lot more scared to make moves ( not necessarily sexual in nature most of the time ) a lot more afraid to do so , but i know that a lot of men and women too who believe this . between friends and myself i know women who have outright told us they do n't understand why we have n't "" made moves "" . i should probably also mention that before the push for movements like this and in general otherwise my friends and i as well as others i 've spoken to about this are really quite confident so i would n't argue that we lack that . my second problem with the movement is that it can harm men who are innocent . i would n't ever argue in favour of a man who has committed sexual assault or god forbid rape , but i fear that men who are called out Falsely on these claims stand to lose their otherwise good reputation , even if they are found not to be guilty . this second problem is n't one where i can necessarily back it up with evidence or events of this happening , yet it is my belief that this is definitely a possibility with cases of this probably already existing . in fact i remember in the past year reading about False accusations of men linked to the #metoo movement , although to be honest i could n't at this very time ( although if i can when i have a bit more time i 'll try ) give any examples of this , sorry . please change my view , like i said overall i believe in the idea of making subject matters like this more open and less taboo , but i think this movement in particular can and have made men afraid and can harm them . thank you : )","as a side , if this whole thing has prompted conversation between men and women like the one you described ( where the women are asking "" why did n't you make a move - i wanted you to "" ) i 'd argue that is a huge plus . it means that it 's forcing people to start communicating about their desires and consent in a more open way , and demystifying each person 's expectations . all comments that earned deltas ( from op or other users ) are listed [ here ] ( / r/deltalog/comments / 9oq8cz/deltas [ # ] metoo does not address the primary problems women face , which is 1 ) the under-reporting of sexual violence and 2 ) the seriousness of which sexual violence reports are taken . [ # ] metoo emboldened women who would already have made a claim without [ # ] metoo , to publicly act as a judge-jury-executioner against their assaulter . item 1 exists as a direct result of item 2 . if she ca n't pick up on your interest without you resorting to actions that could be taken as harassment , the relationship is likely doomed . if you are just trying to score with many women as possible , maybe you should consider whether you are the problem #metoo is addressing . for the second problem , men that are Falsely accused by #metoo activists are likely targets for other reasons . if the #metoo movement did n't exist , the people targeting them would find other popular ways of bringing them down , like tying them to bad political opinions or accusing them of racism . there is a small minority of men who , prior to metoo , were extremely , distractedly concerned with approaching women inappropriately . i 'm talking about rather extreme cases , here . these are people who considered it presumptuous and rude to even look at a woman , who considered it immoral to make any sort of sexual advance on a woman who might not be interested . they would almost certainly be diagnosable with some form of social anxiety . most of them would be extremely happy never trying to initiate a romantic or sexual encounter of any kind , but their friends and families and therapists keep encouraging them to , to their bafflement . for this rare type of person , certain aspects of metoo were probably harmful , and in ways i sympathize with . they 're the ones who actually mean it when they say "" i really care about knowing all the rules , because i feel like a terrible person when i might be breaking them . "" there 's a sarcastic response , because so many dudes argue this in bad faith : "" if you 're so worried that you 're totally upset and frozen , then you need to get help before you talk to any women . "" they 're the guys who would respond , "" i 've been getting help for it for years . "" other people have no reason whatsoever to be hurt by the suggestion to have more consideration towards a woman 's feelings in the moment , or even to err on the side of "" do n't bother this lady "" when things are ambiguous . i do n't think you 're going to find anyone who will challenge the idea that it has made some men afraid and that it can harm innocent men . getting accused of a sexual assault is n't something that 's entirely left to chance . i know i 'll certainly teach my son to be very careful with whom he interacts , to make damn sure that this is a person that you 're comfortable with and trust to not turn on you . but if you 're saving the sexual stuff for people who you actually trust to remain stable , then the chances of you getting Falsely accused of something drop pretty greatly . first of all , with regards to making moves , you 're being super unclear about what you 're referring to here . you seem to mostly be talking about not asking somebody out or doing any sort of clear signal they 're attracted to somebody else , since you say that it 's "" not necessarily sexual in nature most of the time "" , which has basically nothing to do with #metoo . "" some people might possibly be harmed due to False claims in some way and maybe i read something about it but i 'm not sure "" is ... not a lot to go on . i 'll just say the generic bits : there is little reason to suspect that False claims about sexual assault are an epidemic problem or significantly more likely than any other sort of False claim . the number of people who either fear coming forward about their sexual assault due to doubt in the system , or do come forward but are mistreated by the system and fail to get justice , are so much greater than the number of malicious False accusations that it 's silly to treat the ( potential ) Falsely accused as more important than the ( actual ) victims . how many men who do nothing wrong are ' called out Falsely ' and have their lives actually ruined when even actual convicted rapists or sexual assaulters are not ruined or who even gain status ? is it really a bigger problem that a small handful of men who may be innocent risk losing their ' good reputation ' when there are literally millions of women 's whose lives are utterly ruined and their actual attackers not only do n't get a slap on the wrist , but may even in fact gain positive reputation in the eyes of society ? as a man , i know i ’m much more likely to myself be a victim of sexual assault or rape than i am to be Falsely accused . i ’m about as likely to be Falsely accused of rape or sexual assault as i am to be Falsely accused of burglary or attempted murder , and being Falsely accused of those crimes just does n’t take up any of my brain space , so why worry about False rape accusations ? whereas i actually know and am related to men who have been sexually abused and raped — my father was raped by a priest when he was a boy , and my brother was sexually assaulted by a man in high school . the #metoo movement is n’t just about women — men are also very rarely believed when they are sexually assaulted , and #metoo is changing that perception . nothing has changed regarding the law , and nothing has changed regarding what people view as right/wrong ."
9opkkn,"i should be able to refuse identifying with any gender the way i refuse to subscribe to religious beliefs fyi : i 'm using male/female to describe biology and using man/woman as gender . i do n't see the difference between following a societal gender and following a religion . it seems like , in both cases , a certain group of people with overlapping perspectives and interests ascribe to mostly common thought and action patterns . individuals feel pride/euphoria for successfully accomplishing tasks based on their beliefs and experience the opposite when they do n't . there are trends : there are likely more pakistani muslims than chinese muslims the same way there are more female women and male men than vice versa . i 'll pass on making friends with a overtly gendered or ungendered individual the same way i 'll pass on making friends with someone who is super religious , but why is it so unacknowledged to not believe in this mess altogether when gender is more or less how you feel ? if i 'm easily allowed to identify as atheist or agnostic , what 's so different about identifying as agender or genderqueer ? if people do n't automatically assume someone is buddhist because they 're asian why would you assume someone is a woman because they are female ? for some personal context , i 'm anatomically female , but i do n't identify with either gender and exhibit characteristics of both . i mostly present and act as a cisgendered woman because it suits my purposes and makes life easier , but i do n't identify as a woman and do n't need/want to be "" treated like one . "" i 'm fine with female body . i would be equally fine with male body . i experience no phantom limbs or body dysphoria but in my imagination , i 'm always male ( anatomically ) and i mentally perceive myself as a masculine persona .","choosing to identify as a male when you are a female is no different than choosing to identify as a porcupine when you are a duck . when you plunge a new , aggressive conception of gender ( it does n't exist/it 's about what clothes you wear/it 's about our feeeeeeelings ) it 's not gon na stick . it 's not like atheism , which is already understood and inherently part of religious thought . biologically , you have no way of knowing how a male actually feels or perceives , so all you can rely on is stereotypes of what a male should feel like . you are biologically female and you feel a certain way . it seems the answer is more properly phrased - i do n't feel like a stereotypical female , rather more masculine which seems to me to be more stereotypically male , so i would like to be thought of ( with regard to gender ) as male in line with the stereotypes of what a male is . the point is - fine if you want to identify as male or female or whatever . the whole idea is male and female identify a certain set of ( stereotypical ) characteristics , and i am not bound to be characterized that way based on birth . if we really want to destroy the male/female stereotypes i think we should do the opposite - proudly say my gender is female and i can be more stereotypically masculine than males . if enough people are willing to do that , we can ( slowly ) erode the stereotypes that push people to self identify away from their biological sex . i am inclined to agree with you for the most part , but i think that your comparison between assuming religious identity and assuming gender is a bit off-base . i 'm perfectly fine with everybody identifying as whatever gender , but i also do n't see any problem with assuming somebody is cisgender and adjusting my behavior in the future if they tell me otherwise , while i do n't really make any assumptions about religion . this is because being cisgender is far more common than being any specific religion , and because unlike with religion , what gender somebody identifies has some impacts on how i act ( most notably with pronoun usage ) . the chances of causing offense or distress by assuming most people are cisgender are far lower than the chances of causing offense or distress by asking everybody their gender upfront . to be clear , you 're anatomically female but you ca n't really identify as male . male refers to unchangeable things , like your chromosomes or role in reproduction . either way , only very few people would actually cross the line and demand you identify as a man or woman . so really only very few people will actually believe you should identify yourself to others as a woman . you can refuse to identify with gender fine , but there 's no real way to stop people from doing that . the same way people can identify with one religion or not but they ca n't distance themselves from the role religion has had in shaping their world views . while i agree with your post as a whole , i disagree with this part of it . these associations come from societal factors : while there may be a correlation between being asian and being buddhist , it is far , far weaker than the correlation between being female and being a woman . while there ’s certainly nothing wrong with being female and not a woman , the fact that such a large percentage of females are women mean that people are going to make that assumption . however , since society needs a way to define you , it is not your call how others choose to define you . gender roles are socially constructed , but gender itself is not . there 's not such thing as a female man or a male women . so you are a woman who does not identify with either gender 's roles . that 's fine , but you are fundamentally a woman/female and that 's not up for debate regardless of your feelings on the matter ."
9opjox,"so-called "" sexual orientations "" are little more than social identities and in no way meaningful descriptions of actual human tastes this got a bit long so i 'll just enumerate my points at the top : 1 . people do all sorts of things in order to associate with or disassociate from certain identities 2 . past cultures treated it","first of all , attraction is relative : as a heterosexual guy , i ’m attracted to girls a lot more than guys , but i ’m also unequally attracted to girls , as i find some more attractive than others . yeah , i could probably get it on with a girl i find ugly or another guy , but i would enjoy it less . so you could view sexual orientation purely as a sort of utility-maximizing rule . we already understand sexuality in this way : me saying i ’m heterosexual does not mean i find all women attractive . in fact , i find some just plain unattractive , but that does n’t make me not generally attracted to girls . second , people find meaning in sexual orientation whether it ’s accurate or not . if i ’m happy identifying as a heterosexual and only having sex with women , i ’m free to limit myself to that . basically , if i feel that the “ heterosexual ” label fits me well after examining it , there is n’t a need to create my own label . the existentialist and post-modern view that societal structures should n’t be trusted and individuals should forge their own identity is , i believe , not necessarily True . there ’s nothing inherently good or bad about accepting or rejecting social and cultural norms or structures . i would question your view and where it leads , because i think sexual orientations are meaningful enough to people regardless of their exact accuracy . yes , individual people have unique identities , but most people do n’t feel strongly enough about it to forge their own path ."
9opash,"the most vocal opponents of "" white nationalism "" truly believe in "" anti-white nationalism "" i believe that at the core of racial fearmongering and opposition to "" white nationalism "" ( which is itself a fairly absurd concept ) , is a belief that having too many white people is a bad thing , and that society would be better off if there were less people with white skin . i also believe that this is often a subconscious belief , or at least a position not fully self-examined , that many proponents of mainstream "" diversity "" politics hold without acknowledging its racist undertones . if we were truly done with racism we would stop trying to push the idea that any skin tone has inherent benefits that merit special protections or privileges . in other wordd , forcing the inclusion of minorities into places or positions simply because there are "" too many "" white people there , is stupid . competence is n't tied to melanin or lack thereof . - someone who does n't care what colour you are .","the problem is ... white nationalists ( and significant fractions of white and other colored people who are n't white nationalists ) actually do care what color people are . if we do n't care what color people 's skin is , it 's worth expending some effort to fix that . i think something you might be missing of that given the current state of affairs there are those among us who have a vastly different experience of our country than others - and due to unfortunate historical circumstances one divide is race . this does n't mean these differences are inherent to race , but these perspectives can be valuable when decisions impact those in similar situations or say you want to market to demographics in similar situations . and a goal of this regarding policy decisions would be to bring these experiences more in line with one another regardless of how one is born - this is n't as easily understood if you do n't have access to some people who have lived differently in fact , genocide is widely regarded as one of the most evil acts possible . the thing is , people in society are n’t judged purely based on competence , and inequality in opportunities afforded to people ( based on the history of racism ) mean that judging competence 25-odd years into a lifetime of inequality is a poor premise for deciding merit . people want everyone to be given the same opportunities , and actually be judged on merit and actions . so , your argument is basically that the most vocal non-white people opposed to white nationalism are likely non-white nationalists that favor their own ethnicity ? i.e. black people who complain about white nationalism are secretly or openly black nationalists . it seems like if someone were someone who was opposed to white nationalism , but did n’t believe in ‘ anti-white nationalism ’ you could just dismiss that example sa not the ‘ most vocal opponents ? not sure why white nationalism here is in opposition to diversity . are there no ways to condemn something like "" white nationalism "" , understand the value of "" merit "" while not believing that the society would be better with less white people ? i do n't think i 've ever heard anyone say that it would be a good thing if there were fewer white people . diversity is about letting people mix and share in the rewards of society , not about controlling the absolute numbers of people . diversity is about the distribution of people as a function of some characteristics like skin color across geographies and rungs of society and culture , not whether people exist or not in the first place . for example , we can imagine a society with many fewer white people and many more black people than contemporary america , but where black and white people do not live or work together or share in the rewards and burdens of that society . i 'm white and i 'm a very vocal opponent of white nationalism . the problem with the "" let 's just forget this whole race thing and get it over with "" attitude is that it does n't seek to abolish any structures that are in place right now but thinks it can just solve a problem by stopping to talk about it . nobody is trying to push the idea that people of say black skin colour are better than white people , that is not the narrative that the vast majority of people would subscribe to if the are arguing for quotas and the like . firstly , merit is a concept that is n't objective , if the people who decide what merit looks like are for example white and male , than having an accent for example will often inhibit those people from judging someone fairly , as some accents are connected to lower intellect in the mind of society ( i mean , take a random crowd and play them an explanation of a difficult topic once narrated by a typical male white voice and once by any female "" black "" accent , most people will judge the male voice as more competent , there have been studies about this ) . a white person will on average have better access to anything that will boost their chances , therefore any attempt of "" just judging based on skill "" will ignore the fact that the enviroment in which for example black people grow up are just worse on average than those in which white people grow up ."

9onop4,"election day should not be a holiday as we reach election day in the us , i 've seen numerous posts about how election day should be a national holiday . see here : [ -- url -- ) . this wapo article appeared a couple days ago on / r/politics and was highly upvoted . though i personally vote , and want to make voting as easy as possible , i do not believe making election day a federal holiday would result in a material increase in voter turnout for the following reasons : & #x200b ; 1 . making a day a federal holiday is no guarantee that businesses would close that day . i have worked in numerous companies over the past 15 years of my working career in various industries and have never , for example , had off for mlk day , columbus day , veterans day , or presidents day , which are all federal holidays ( albeit ' lesser ' ones ) . i ca n't imagine private enterprises would treat election day with any more reverence . the only institutions that seem to be closed those days are banks , schools , and government offices . 2 . the article above that i cited states "" according the current population survey , the occupations that report the highest voter turnout rates in midterm elections are salaried professionals with flexible work schedules such as lawyers , educators and executives . those with the lowest turnout are hourly paid workers in service jobs in restaurants and retail "" . as i stated above in point 1 , it is doubtful that restaurants and retail would close on election day . i mean forget the lesser holidays for a second , i 've seen retail stores open for christmas . and when i worked retail , i remember working many memorial days , july 4ths , etc . getting back to point 1 , the places most likely to close are the ones with a fairly high concentration of salaried , college educated personnel . ( bankers , teachers , civil servants ) who may be a bit more flexible . and i understand teachers may not necessarily be able to take a long lunch break or something to go to vote , or may not be able to arrive at work an hour late because they voted in the morning , but when i was in high school , our school day was 7.30-2.15 . and when i was in elementary , it was 9-3.15 . if the polls are open 8-8 , which is about standard , i think there is time to vote there . i 'm not trying to open up a can of worms with teachers , because i understand that they work hard , and after school they are doing course planning , and are maybe supervising after school activities , but maybe those after school activities can be canceled that one day ( considering the alternative considered is to cancel the entire day , i think that 's fair ) 3 . many states already have on the books laws which grant employees to take a couple hours pto ( generally like 2 ) to vote : [ -- url -- ) . through reading this article , i learned that many states do not protect an employee 's right to vote . maybe the better compromise law is all employers must provide either pto for an employee to vote , or allow them to vote as part of their normal work day on election day . that seems to be a fairly unobtrusive compromise . and if you think that businesses would not honor that , then why would they honor granting pto for an entire day 's closure or just close entirely for that day ? 4 . i think the real difficulty in getting people to vote in america is its arcane recordkeeping system . other countries have automatic voter registration , which is something we should have in america . no reason not to do that ( except for of course the obvious , actual reason which is to dissuade people from voting ) and our polling stations are sometimes under-funded ( think too few booths at polls , and too few polls , and an over-reliance of volunteers ) . if we made easier the voting procedure , i think that would increase voter turnout substantially so reddit , change my view . convince me of the necessity of the holiday","the government could require certain classes of businesses be closed on the day . several states have laws about being open on thanksgiving and christmas . to your first point : you could literally make it the law that no one could work more than half the day on election day , unless they were deemed "" emergency personel "" ( aka firefighters , ems , police , er docs , etc. ) to your other point , coupling a federal election day holiday with a shift in the voting day itself to the first saturday after the first full week in november would make your other complaints largely disappear . prior to reading this i was always in favor of making the day a holiday . i think the main idea behind it is that everyone just assumes that companies give employees federal holidays off . i think mandating that into law would be fair and give people the chance to vote if they want to . none of your points refute that making it a national holiday would be a bad thing ; only that it may not work as well as people think . i can only see it helping voter turnout with no negatives . your view seems to concede that at least some additional people would be able to vote if election day were a federal holiday . also , even if the increase in voter turnout is marginal , what ’s the down side of having an extra day off work ?"

"" fairness "" is a pretty arbitrary concept , i think you 're asking the wrong question : would the person gluing shoes for $ 0.30 be better off if the quality of life americans and europeans currently enjoy were to suddenly disappear ? in fact , it 's likely that this person 's life would 've been worse , because they do still enjoy at least the fringe benefits of western industrial products , and the fact that they can get even the $ 0.30 is dependent on it . in other words , i think the world as it 's structured today , with the numbers and distribution of the population is inextricably intertwined with free market capitalism . even though there are , let 's say , "" forces "" that do not want this kind of exploitation to end , that does not mean it wo n't or that countries of the free world support it . i assume in a lot of ways , you ’re referring to relationships like western companies using cheap labor for textiles in indonesia or electronics like in china . not my main point , but still worth mentioning is that japan has a great quality of life and is not western . as for the suffering of others , the human development index shows that many countries that first were cheap labor pools , used that money to create more wealth and now the hdi is growing exponentially in this countries . tim cook ( apple ceo ) said himself that china is no longer the cheap labor market for electronics , they are the experts now . non-western countries can use it and if they make better products , they will succeed . let 's say i define "" western quality of life "" as individual liberty with my essential and consumer needs met . for instance , technological developments in , say , china have brought a more "" western quality of life "" without taking from others — you just improve on the living conditions of the past . capitalism might be a zero-sum game ( which is a different argument ) , but the "" western quality of life "" does n't have to be . i would say the western quality of life does n't depend on the suffering of others ; it 's currently an unfortunate byproduct that can be eventually separated with technological development . western quality of life does no depend on the suffering of others . however , modern time corporations using cheap labour is in no way comparable to those days . the most important difference is that corporations have to pay their workers , if even so little . as for where i disagree , your own future quaility of life likely depends on the suffering you went through to obtain it . by your logic , losing workers by allowing people to leave the us should make it harder for the us to sustain itself , and therefore it should be hard to leave . if i have a widget and you have a dollar , and we trade ( you give me your dollar and i give you my widget ) . at least one of us values what we are trading for as more valuable than what we have , and the other thinks they are equal in value or thinks what they have is less valuable . in other words , it is almost certain that every trade adds value . your argument is that even though its the best time to be alive for the most people in the history of ever , thanks to capitalism , that since not everyone is in the exact same economic position that it is bad ."
9om3it,"there is a fundamental underlying difference between the worldviews of the american left and right that will ensure no compromise will ever be agreeable to both quite simply , the right places paramount importance on personal property . the fundamental philosophy of conservativism is that no one else has a right to anyone else 's property . conservatives do not apologize for putting their needs and wants ahead of others whom they have never met and do not know . they do not want to be forced to be made responsible for the problems of others , which is what basically every welfare program the left desires represents . meanwhile , the left does not believe that the needs and wants of an individual should be placed ahead of others . they believe it is morally acceptable to appropriate ( forcibly , really , because all taxation is such ) the wealth of some and redistribute it to others . they choose to make decisions with other people 's wealth for them , such as the mentality of "" oh , you make enough money , you do n't need it all , let some of it go to others . "" as such this is a foundational difference in the two worldviews and one that honestly can not be bridged . either there would be zero redistribution of earnings , which is what conservatives want and those on the left find unnaceptable , or there would be any degree of welfare which is vice verca .","they just use it for more public things . this is n't a large , fundamental difference though because both parties use the same framework to get what they want . except they 'll give huge amounts of tax money to farmers , and oil companies , in the form of subsidies . and even that ignores the moralistic restrictions the right wants to place on what i can grow on my property ( not marijuana , that 's somehow important enough to restrict my property rights for the public good ) , or who i can have sex with on my property ( not a member of the same sex ) , or what i can do with the internal organs which by definition i own . again , i 'm not sure what you see as making that different from republicans saying "" you need to pay for these tanks because my constituents like big tanks and the factory is in my state "" , or "" you need to pay for the fbi to investigate people ( and the doj charge them ) for marijuana possession "" . in both cases it 's "" redistributing "" wealth for the purpose of a national good ( as seen by the individual ) . until they do n't want that because they want to give iowan corn farmers money to grow ethanol and other crops , which they take out of my paycheck . the difference is n't principle , it 's what the sides define as a sufficient good worthy of receiving money from the public . i do n't think enough of the country supports the extreme views you suggest to ensure that there will be no compromise . i 'm generally left leaning , but i 'm not in favor of communism . there are topics that have seen even bigger shifts , like opinion on homosexuality . so , while left and right are polarized , and will continue to be , the topics that divide them will continue to shift . the funny thing is , if you look at history , this country has always been like this . while they were n't "" left "" and "" right "" the way we think of them today , this country had two fiercely divided camps when it was being founded : the federalists and the anti federalists . there was a fundamental underlying difference between the worldviews and the perceived role of government . even republicans can understand the idea of social insurance , and that hard times might happen to them , and that there is benefit in never letting anyone starve to death . however , they would disagree on the fine details of how to run the program . as others have pointed out , you ’re right about the fundamental dichotomy but your view can change regarding the consequences . it ’s not perfect - we ’ve been ( imo ) tilted towards undertaxed for some time now , but we avoid the extremes and overall standard of living , poverty rates and most metrics of a healthy society continue to improve . i believe there is shared room for compromise because both sides want a larger share of wealth . more wealth , because there is now a larger share of it . but neither side is going to complain that there 's a bigger pie ( of wealth ) to preserve ( right ) or appropriate ( left ) . what they do with the pie might differ , but both worldviews compromise that a bigger pie is good . and thus , although you focus on ideological differences on what to do with the pie , both sides will still compromise so that the pie is always expanding . i think you 've given an overly simplistic , and completely unrealistic , description of the political philosophy of both the american left and right which does not represent what either side truly believes . conservatives do not wholly embrace personal liberty in the way you describe . they may favor it , but there are plenty of issues in which they sacrifice personal liberty for the common good . conversely , on many of those same issues the american left favors individual liberty over social good . neither side 's ideology is nearly as simplistic as you portray them . a hard right libertarian , espouses the position that the government should barely exist ( if at all ) , and the ' market ' will somehow magically take care of any conflicts . many ( although not all ) are perfectly comfortable with things like public schools , public parks , libraries , roads , mail delivery , etc. . . all of these programs involve some level of taxation and subsequent unequal distribution of the money collected . and a specific type of social welfare that has been labelled as "" welfare "" , which usually involve cash or in-kind benefits to people at or close to poverty . meanwhile , on the left many people want the country to go beyond what is currently provided , and provide more benefits ( for people in or close to poverty and also just for everyone ) like universal healthcare , college tuition , etc. . most people on the right support practices like "" stop and frisk "" which seem to violate protections on private property for the sake of general welfare , which per your view is more of a leftist position . so i think we 're already compromising to a great degree , and do n't fit into the worldviews described . a hundred years ago homosexuals were prosecuted , today they have nearly equal rights ( ca n't quite order a cake yet ) ."
9ojmaq,""" the west "" is an overused term that has no real signficance as a tool to analyze values , morals , societys or the individual most english speaking people , most us citizens argue about the falling ( or rise ) of the west as a political , religious , moral , ethnical o economic unit of power that i profoundly think is more separate and diverse that most people give credit . by no means i 'm saying that the term does n't matter , it had ( and still have ) a conceptual value to bring some clarity or coherence to a bundle of ideals that various societys deem important but the fact that many people express that "" the west "" is declining/changing/rising / expanding or whathever other verb , implying that "" the west "" it 's a cohesive group of like minded people all in equal footing and sharing the same historical background or even worst : facing the same problematics it 's harming to 1 : the concept/term itself because the overuse of anything will inherently make it worthless 2 : the specific problems , challenges and opportunities that local communities , individual states , and nation states that are n't necessarily the us and canada have .",""" the west "" is still a term that has a meaning and is useful . i do n't think it 's useful to think of western thinking as pertinent to small scale problems like local communities or even individual nations , but it is worthwhile to understand the large differences between philosophical and cultural traditions and how they impacted our history . but even describing the power of the west as relatively declining or threatened is somewhat meaningful - we view isis in the middle east , russian interference in democracy , and economic competition from asia as common concerns , and western countries have worked together on them - coalitions in the middle east , shared investigative resources and findings re : russia , and formed trade alliances to protect our interests . i 'm not saying it 's never overused/misapplied , but i do n't think the specific case you suggested , where people worry about a general decline , is necessarily irrational . every western country shares an approximately equal standard of living . every western country shares a legal and social system that is broadly the same . somebody comparing canada to the us from outside of canada and the us is n't going to see many differences at all . to them they 're simply western countries with a certain standard of living and way of life ."
9oj9lj,"schools should not punish cyber-bullying if it goes on off campus schools have no reason to supervise children once they leave the school grounds . it has been that way since schools have been around , and just because they have the means to do so does not mean they should . in cases like hermitage vs layshock they ruled that the “ bully ” had his first amendment rights taken away . it is unconstitutional to punish what students say because it is abridging freedom of speech . in the 2011 international journal of adolescent medicine and health said that 55 % of students reported bullying , and of these only 18 % reported cyber bullying . this means that over half of all kids have been bullied , but only 18 % of them have been cyber bullied . this means that bullying itself is a much bigger issue that schools do not deter . the school already has power over what happens on school grounds in real life , and they are doing a horrible job , so why should they be given the ability to disregard the law and citizens rights ?","even if you 're technically correct , not doing anything about bullying is not acceptable anymore . so it leads to parents pushing for policies on bullying . basically from there , parents pull their students out of districts and schools that do not have a bullying policy and put them into schools that do . from that point , the schools that lose enrollment for their lack of bullying policy dry up and become underfunded creating economic problems for everything that derives profit from the placement of the school . schools should n't punish real-life bullying on campus either , assaulting a child should be a police matter ( even if it 's also a juvenile offender ) . there is overwhelming precedent that schools can punish bullies without violating their rights . all 50 states have passed anti-bullying legislation , and federal case law has confirmed the right of schools to enforce anti-bullying measures for off-campus bullying if it affects learning at school . hermitage vs. layshock has nothing to do with bullying between students , it has to do with a student who posted a parody of his principal on myspace resulting in the student receiving an egregious punishment which significantly affected his education . not just that , the court 's findings were contingent on the fact that there was no in-school disruption resulting from the student 's actions which could have justified the school 's response , but in cases of cyber bullying the major focus in prevention is specifically for cyber bullying resulting in disruption at school , such as cyber bullying resulting in a detriment to a victim 's mental health . in cases like these , cyber bullying meets the court 's criteria for intervention by the school in the very case you cite . i would like to respond to your second claim , but i am currently unable to because i can not find the specific study you are citing . in new york , the dignity of all students act details how bullying should be handled by schools . cyberbullying falls under dasa , even though it does not take place on school grounds because : in other words , if cyberbullying outside of school makes a kid scared to go to school , unable to function properly in school , or creates a hostile environment ( like gossiping , verbal harassment , and threats ) , then it can be punished by the school . you have to demonstrate this by showing that the child is reluctant to go to school ( chronic absences , tardies , going to the nurse to go home , avoiding classes and situations where the bully is , etc ) . if you wrote someone a letter and mailed it , telling someone you were going to kick their ass , and the only place you saw them was school , that letter would be considered bullying for school purposes , no ? secondly , that case involved the “ cyber bullying ” of a principle , not a student . the courts ruled that once the off campus literature comes into campus , into the “ school gates , ” or whatever language they use , then it becomes within the purview of the school . in my state , both bullying and cyber-bullying are prohibited in the state code . the law recognizes clear limits to freedom of speech , and those limits include speech that creates a hostile environment at work or school . because if they ’re being online bullied , they ’re being bullied in school too , and affects school performance ."
9oi6ik,"the republican party 's position on endangered species ( and specifically wolves and bears ) is in general bad for both the economy and the environment following is a direct quote from the 2016 republican party platform : > there is certainly a need to protect certain species threatened worldwide with extinction . however , the endangered species act ( esa ) should not include species such as gray wolves and other species if these species exist elsewhere in healthy numbers in another state or country . to upset the economic viability of an area with an unneeded designation costs jobs and hurts local communities . we must ensure that this protection is done effectively , reasonably , and without unnecessarily impeding the development of lands and natural resources . the esa should ensure that the listing of endangered species and the designation of critical habitats are based upon sound science and balance the protection of endangered species with the costs of compliance and the rights of property owners . instead , over the last few decades , the esa has stunted economic development , halted the construction of projects , burdened landowners , and has been used to pursue policy goals inconsistent with the esa — all with little to no success in the actual recovery of species . for example , we oppose the listing of the lesser prairie chicken and the potential listing of the sage grouse . neither species has been shown to be in actual danger and the listings threaten to devastate farmers , ranchers , and oil and gas production . while species threatened with extinction must be protected under the esa , any such protection must be done in a reasonable and transparent manner with stakeholder input and in consideration of the impact on the development of lands and natural resources . it is stated above that that the endangered species act "" should not include species such as gray wolves ... \ [ since they \ ] exist elsewhere in healthy numbers . "" this is the equivalent of saying ' not my problem ' in response to the fact that wolves are heavily negatively impacted by human development . wolves are an important part of the natural north american deciduous forest and evergreen forest ecosystems . they control the populations of numerous mega-fauna such as deer , moose , elk , caribou , etc . they are much more influential than coyotes and are also less dangerous : of the 3 aggravated encounters between humans and wolves in the us in 2017 , two involved the mishandling of captive wolves and one was during a dogsled race in the middle of nowhere . none were fatal . it is generally my understanding that the main fear of the recovery of north american wolf population and territory is due to threats to livestock and people . however , even that is not necessarily reasonable : in areas that have wolves , less than 5 % of non-harvesting livestock deaths were due to wolf attacks ; 80 % were due to diseases . if republican policy on wolves was specifically in the interest of farmers , they would be devoting more attention towards giving american farmers funding for infrastructure and antibiotics that can help improve the farms ' sanitation . in addition to this , deer and other wolf prey constantly pose a threat to the crops of plant farmers , a problem to which a recovery in the population of wolves could be extremely beneficial . in 2017 , congress voted for and passed the joint resolution bill h.j.res 69 , which voids a us fish and wildlife service rule that prohibits the hunting of wolves and grizzly bears in alaska . there are now no rules prohibiting the hunting of any such animals , even cubs/pups or pregnant mothers , in reserves in alaska . these attacks on endangered species which are vital to their ecosystems is less an act in the interest of farmers and ranchers and more for the purpose of keeping oil and gas lobbyists on their side and donating their billions of dollars of potentially illicit soft money to super pacs that help republicans run successful re-election campaigns . note : this account is not a throwaway account , i just made a new account several days ago to replace my previous reddit account . note 2 : a majority of my statistics come from wikipedia . if you have a problem with any of my factual claims/figures , please link a new source that provides contrasting data . i look forward to hearing your opinions .","i completely agree hunting endangered species is bad for the environment . it costs money to make sure people do n't shoot animals , to keep tabs on their numbers , and to provide other environmental benefits to ensure their survival . wolves and grizzly bears are no longer on the endangered species list . this means that their numbers have rebounded to a significant degree , and in some places they are even reaching overpopulation numbers causing lots of issues in their habitats and endangering other species . there is absolutely no reason to keep the bans on hunting them if they are no longer on the endangered species list . also economically banning hunting costs a lot of money to enforce . it is actually better for the economy to allow the hunting . this is because you sell hunting tags , the hunters can also sell the pelts and sometimes the meat . not really , its more saying that we wo n't use the endangered species act for species that are n't actually endangered . anytime we develop a piece of forested land , we are going to be altering the habitat of not just wolves , but everything that lives in that forest . we do n't worry about messing up the deer population , even if they might become endangered in that particular subdivision . the endangered species act is designed to prevent extinction , not prevent any change in habitat . i 'm going to counter your argument with a disadvantage rather than a logical critique and then ask you to weigh the benefit between our two viewpoints ( mine being that this issue should be handled locally except in the case of extremely endangered species ) . all wildlife protection causes otherwise usable land to remain undeveloped . if it were n't preventing usable development , then it would n't be protection ( it would just be the status quo ) . in north america , the development of wilderness often impacts the housing market - either by directly - by increasing the cost of land within the vicinity of a given population center . otherwise usable land remains undeveloped , limiting supply in the market and increasing cost . if the overall cost of land for dwellings increases , then the cost of housing will increase . even if the government completely socialized the housing market , the increased opportunity cost would still exist , which increases cost for the government . a good practical example of this are the extensive laws that exist in california about ' scenic views ' , which are directly responsible for the housing crisis along the coast . put quite simply , if population increases and you are n't allowed to build any more rooms ... then the cost of housing will increase and a lot of people will go homeless . therefore , i think that non-extremely-endangered species should be handled on a case by case basis . of course , and in those instances the local government should try to preserve the ecosystem . in other instances , is the wolf population sitting on a parcel of land that could otherwise be used to build a 3,000 person apartment complex that would help keep a lot of people out of homelessness ? and in that case , the local government should have the freedom to decide what happens ."

9ogz17,"the dehumanization of opponents through the "" npc "" meme is an direct response to the dehumanization of opponents through calling them "" russian bots "" , and both are forcing an us vs. them mentality that continues to divide the west . from what i 've seen people are outraged that the alt-righters are completely dehumanizing and devaluing the opinion of their leftist opponents to sub-human levels . it should also be noted that a similar tactic was on the other side of the political divide , in calling those who replied , liked , or retweeted trump 's twitter posts "" russian bots "" , devaluing their opinion to an equal level of an "" npc "" . i will concede however that atleast the russian bots dehumanizing comes from some sort of reality , that russia has it out for america . the whole npc thing is nonsensical from my knowledge and has no ( grounded in reality ) background .","my thing is , russian bots is a : at least grounded in some form of reality , and b : at least mildly funny . can you provide evidence that the same individuals are outraged about the npc meme and also criticized literally anyone who liked , replied to , or retweeted trump tweets as a russian bot ? also , you 're heavily distorting the views of someone who would call someone else a russian bot in a way that only hurts your overall position . from what i have seen the npc part is based off the interactions people have with protesters . it is about how their response to such an easy question is met with a blank face , as if the answer is n't in the scripted responses , so the person just defaults out , like an npc . but because people who are left leaning tend to follow more empathetic emotional arguments it 's easier to criticize them as a result . common arguments i see that usually are n't very well thought out : when you 've considered your world views enough having a tier 1 argument with someone when you have a tier 2 premise is annoying and self-defeating . russian bots exist , and in fact impersonate americans on twitter , facebook , and other platforms all the time . so there is an actual , real life chance that someone you 're interacting with online is a ' bot . it 's rude to say to someone you know is a real person , though arguably , none of us really know anything about each other . calling someone an npc is just a baseless insult formulated in response to the real fear of ' bot amplifying divisive messages . 700,000 people may have interacted with bots , thinking they were real . the irony is that sometimes , those bots were amplifying so-called leftist views , in an inflammatory way to fuel arguing and division . i do n't think the npc meme is dehumanizing in any way . it 's just a funny way to point out that someone is just repeating the same slogans , like an npc in a video game would . i 've seen that behavior in all kinds of people regardless of political views , so i do n't think the meme should be restricted to just leftists . ironic really imo ) , i do n't think it 's fomenting division any more than any of the past political slurs . it 's fptp combined with gerrymandering and the unequal distribution of reps within the electoral college ( i 'm not convinced the electoral college itself is the issue but i do think the census should be done more frequently ) which are fomenting divisions at the federal level . i thought the russian bot "" thing came from twitter and facebook bots , as in algorithms placed there by russian agents ?"

9ogmfx,"a unified eu would be very powerful if not a superpower & #x200b ; the eu is pretty much one state already and i struggle to see many downsides . & #x200b ; i know that many in the uk ( where i am ) strongly dislike the idea of the eu as one country but i do n't understand why . often people say that the states of europe would lose their identity if the eu became one country however most if not all us states have distinct identites and they were never their own countries \ . the fear of a unified eu has been the core of many arguments for brexit , so i am curious as to another argument aganst it . & #x200b ; \ i know one ( texas ? ) was its own state at one point . & #x200b ; sorry about spelling and grammar .","state boundaries are basically an arbitrary distinction in the us . but for a unified eu , it 's the country itself that would be an arbitrary distinction - as all its states would be so dissimilar . most of the eu nations people pretty clearly do n’t want to put the cost into upgrading to that extent . the ability to defend oneself self is a bare minimum requirement for a superpower because without it you can excel however much you want in other ways but it wo n’t matter when someone just takes what you have . would n't that be something of a boon - not having to take responsibility for places that are literally rioting when the issues have little to do with your country 's actions ? you get a lot of problems when trying to combine countries that have different socioeconomic factors , different policy beliefs , and different ethnic and cultural backgrounds . policies that work in richer countries like germany or sweden , things like worker protections or drug laws , may be prohibitively expensive in other countries such as bulgaria and croatia . sure , it being one unified country , they could certainly transfer the funding around to pay for welfare if it ends up being more expensive than one area can support to put that state on equal footing than the other states . i guess countries like the uk , france + ger could get along closer , but already looking into italy , the people there have a different stance to migration then the people in lets say germany . so while greece , italy or spain , with their failing economy , would benefit such a union , strong countries will have to carry that burden . germany almost unified europe 80 years ago ... but it got rid of the jewish minority and some others ... the us and eu were formed to address very different problems . if the eu were to centralize under a stronger federal gov like the us , it would no doubt be a serious contender as superpower . the question is whether they are interested in superpower status ."
9oge1j,"countries and borders are n't bad ideas , but nation-states and ideas of national identity are . i am not a fan of the fact that human 's have a tendency to define themselves by a larger group . in order to do so , we sometimes even make up groups off of meaningless things like race , ethnicity , and national identity . i think national identity is a stupid idea that leads to intolerance and irrationality . more so , i think the concept of a nation state is abhorrent as it perpetuates a myth that people of different "" nationalities "" are different and the state should favor your nationality specifically . however , i do n't believe the world will be one big country ( especially a successful one ) anytime soon . some people say these two views of mine negate each other , but i do n't believe so . although borders are also made up , if they are obtained in a moral way and agreed upon , they can serve a purpose . essentially , different countries can exist in the sense of different areas of land living under a different set of laws and are governed by separate governing bodies and systems . this means that we should n't identify ourselves by the random fact of where we are born but just as individuals , while still being able to have different laws and systems of government than other places . if one did not like the country they lived in the can try to help improve or be welcomed by another country closer fitting what it wants . that does not mean immigration would go unchecked , borders and immigration screenings would still be enforced , but welcoming immigration policies could arise that were welcoming from people of all other countries as they are not seen as belonging to a separate identity . essentially , the idea that a country is a state for a certain group or nationality would be gone , leaving a lack of identity with that country but a government with sovereignty for all of its inhabitants remaining . in my vision it would be that someone from canada , the us , saudi arabia , and ethiopia all believe themselves not to be of a different people , just living under different rules in a different part of the world . when a country makes its laws , it would not be saying these are the laws of the xyz people , but the laws of all inhabitants from all backgrounds who live under citizenship and law of xyz country which are enforced in this specific area of land . i understand this is very unlikely to happen in full ( or even at all ) , as humans like to defined by an in group and out group , and many cling hard onto group identities . however , if we actively try to stop defining ourselves by meaningless labels , maybe we could get something similar to what i have described .","they are not meaningless things to racists , sexists , ignorant and emotionally driven people ( most people fall into at least one of these categories ) . more like some people in power have convinced soldiers and diplomats of their group that the other people are different/bad . at which point you 'd be changing the title without changing the government or the people . as an american , i would be thrilled if we could get 80 % of america to read at a 10th grade reading level within the next 30 years . as for saudi arabia , they just had a journalist killed , cut apart into chunks , and then dumped in a shallow grave outside a consulate , and then threatened the world with economic retaliation if anyone did anything . citizens of countries that no longer live within that country , but still have citizenships of that country , in many cases , are subject to their nation 's laws . for example , american expats owe billions in back taxes to the irs , because all american citizens owe taxes on foreign profits as individuals . how do you stop policy from drifting as people enter that may not be fully in line with the current citizens ? what is to stop an area from just going massively in debt if all those people can just go to other areas ? that kind of libertarian philosophy works for some , but many others , such as those that believe abortion is baby murder are n't going to want to have that happen anywhere , not just in their own country . the answer , of course , is that these different groups of people have different cultures . there is nothing wrong with having a distinctive culture , and there is nothing wrong with organizing the state around the dominant culture of the people within the borders of the state . in fact , i can think of no better way to determine the government and laws which govern a people than to build those laws from the culture of that people . ( obviously , as the culture grows and changes so too will the laws and government grow and change . ) to be more explicit : your idea that "" states are okay , but nations are n't "" is a contradiction because it is the existence of the nation that justifies the creation of the state . before the idea of the nation-state caught fire in the 19th century , the state was literally just a protection racket run by the descendants of whichever noble family conquered the region most recently . hell , that 's still the way some nations are run ( cough cough saudi arabia cough ) , but i would n't want to live in any of those places . you 're right that national identity has a problematic side , but i do n't see how you build independent states without it . national identity is different than race , sex , ethnicity in that it represents not only an identifier of what country you are from , but should also represent a set of belief systems . in other words , it is racist , or at least ignorant , to assume that someone asian believes certain things just because he is asian . however , someone who is american or french or chinese or north korean represents a belief system about government , civics , society , etc. . but , if you hold yourself out to be a proud american or proud north korean , presumably , you are making a statement that you 're beliefs are in line with the principles of the nation . this does not mean that every american must agree with trump , but they should agree with american ideals that the country was founded on individual freedom , democracy , certain inalienable rights , free markets . because it is possible to have different views on fundamental topics like these , it makes sense to have nations - which are groups of people that collectively agree with a certain set of core principles around which to establish a government . much more so , than people of different races , in that ( unless you are a dissident ) , you presumably hold different ideas and beliefs about certain fundamental principles ."
9oekx3,"it is absolutely ok to experience more fear if a young black male is approaching you late at night in an american city . ok so the title was a bit of clickbait and this topic is very complex so let me break it down before i get a bunch of emotional responses . i 'm going to flush out my argument and in the next section i will basically respond to what i think most people will disagree with . i want my view changed . i want to award deltas . so please read the next sections so that you understand my argument . & #x200b ; 1 . so when i say it 's absolutely ok ... obviously i do n't mean absolutely , i 'm using this word to emphasize my argument . 2 . when i use the word "" ok "" i 'm meaning that it is rational . it is rational to experience more fear if a young black male is approaching you because statistically young black males contribute to a much larger percentage of crime and murder per capita . this is fact . if you want to dispute this idea , please provide a pdf or link to the fbi crime report and show me where this is not fact . every year that i have looked up black young males are disproportionately committing crime . 3 . i understand that some cities do n't have a lot of black crime nor do they have a large black population . it is very different emotionally responding to a young black male in baltimore or detroit than it is in minnesota . so when i use the word american city , i am in a sense oversimplifying . responding with "" well in my city we have more x race or y sex that commits crime will not award you a delta . 4 . the reason for using "" late at night "" is because most crimes are committed late at night . it 's not to say it ca n't happen during other times , but late at night we tend to be on edge because of this fact . & #x200b ; 5 . i understand the media disproportionately reports on black crime versus white crime . i understand that in most areas you are more likely to be killed or jumped by a white person , this is just a matter of the amount of white people that live in the usa . if you are approached late at night by a person , you should be wary . i 'm just saying that it makes sense statistically that if this person is young , black , and male that you should be more worried . & #x200b ; 6 . i used the words young and male because out of most crimes in the aa community they tend to be disproportionately committed by "" young "" and "" male "" . for example young black men contribute to 7 % of the population but they commit 40 % of the murders ( fbi crime stats 2016 ) & #x200b ; 7 . i 'm not racist . i 'm part african american part white . & #x200b ; 8 . and this is the big argument . our emotions are based upon experience . i 'm a neuroscientist and our emotions are partly responsible by the amygdala and reticular formation and often we have no conscious control over our emotions . therefore , they are often irrational ( fear of flying for example ) since we can not control our emotions it is ok to feel fear of a young black male approaching you late at night versus the statistical opposite an old asian female ( the least likely to commit crime according to fbi statistics in 2016 ) & #x200b ;","you are discounting everything about him as an individual and all the differences he has from those who commit crime , and reducing him to "" has black skin / others with black skin commit crimes / he 's likely to commit a crime "" . you 're not saying "" the population of black people is more likely to commit crime than the population of white people "" . instead , you 're taking one , single , individual and concluding that he is more likely to commit crime based upon the color of his skin . but you know absolutely nothing about him ( beyond his skin color ) with which to make that judgement . as an individual , he could be second only to jesus christ himself in the amount of good he contributes to the world . but because he has black skin , you 've judged him to be a likely criminal . race can be such an easy thing to spot that it might be tempting to assume it has a bigger role as a predictor than it actually has . if society assumes that race will be a significant predictor there will be a lot of data / talks about its effect . i for example think that facing a hooded individual on the street poses more risk than an unhooded one . however if i ask myself should i be worried when in such a situation i would not answer yes or no but i would be very interested in other signs of danger/safety . maybe you mean that it 's "" sensible "" to be afraid of young black males approaching you at night . regardless , it seems like you 've got a sort of dilemma : on the one hand , you feel the way you feel , and people in "" rational discussions "" like this one are n't likely to change that , and , on the other hand , you 're exposed to people pushing messages like "" being afraid of black people is racism . "" one resolution to this dilemma is to just embrace being "" entitled "" : take the steps to make yourself feel safe when you 're feeling stress , and recognize that pushing a larger social agenda is really a luxury that you ca n't afford until your more immediate needs are taken care of . people who choose to dress in the thug style put me on alert . i know not everyone who dresses that way are thugs , but i ca n't tell the difference , so they all alert me . i do n't know if it 's fair to say that "" fear "" is rational simply because emotions are not logical or empirical propositions -- by definition , they ca n't be rational or irrational the way thoughts can . the thing is , young black men are more likely statistically than others to be a danger to you , but they ’re not likely . if you get super defensive and paranoid at every black guy you see , it is disproportionate , and therefore the rudeness it conveys is not worth it . okay , so i know you meant that it 's okay to experience more fear from black people than white people , \ all else equal \ . you say the fear is "" okay "" because it is rational , yet you also say that it is "" okay "" because we can not control our irrational emotions . and yes , it is rational to assign higher probabilities of occurrence to things you think occur with higher probability . however , this does n’t make it “ ok , ” — as in , “ do n’t worry about it , keep up the good work ” — but rather should make you question whether or not your perception of the risk of certain behaviors is fully accurate . if 1/1000 criminals have brown hair and 2/1000 criminals have blonde hair , by your logic , the blondes are twice as dangerous as the brunettes , and it makes sense to avoid them . if you walk past a white person at night and then you walk past a black person at night , do you treat them the same ? one is : "" since we can not control our emotions it is ok ... "" and the other is that fear of a young black male is a rational choice based on fbi statistics . so when it comes to the first argument , i would n't chastise someone for feeling scared when they saw a young black man , but if they followed that up by saying "" i do n't like feeling this way , it makes me nervous and guilty , and i 'm afraid of it 's effect on the young black males that walk by me at night "" - we might work on changing the belief system that has resulted in that fear . chances are that no one who experiences a gut feeling of fear in response to young black male is really calculating actuarial tables based on fbi stats in their head , so in so far as you describe this fear as rational , i 'm pretty skeptical . there is more to a rational decision that is x person more likely than y person to harm me . the real question here is not whether fear of a young black male is rational , but whether it is helpful . it certainly is n't helpful to young black males , and its benefit to the fearful person seems to be quite marginal , if not actually hurtful , since most people feel uncomfortable when they behave in ways that are consTrued as racist . i ’d be scared no matter what color he is . most statistics only tell us what race the perpetrator of a particular crime was . what they do n't tell us , is how many unique persons of each race are behind those crimes . it 's possible that 70 % of all crimes with a young black male perpetrator are actually perpetrated by the same 1 % of all young black males ( this is just an example ) . the chance then that the young black male you encounter , happens to be from the statistically small group that commit crimes , would be very low . as a white man , i have more statistical reason to fear white men than black men ( if the link doesnt work i 'll re-link it , i 'm on mobile so idk how good the link is ) you call this reaction to seeing someone walk down the street both irrational and rational . to me , these fears are irrational ( as you mentioned ) and we attempt to explain our brains hesitation with an actual rational argument . our fear is not based in rational thought and is only assigned legitimacy through statistics after the fact . i think the big questions are follow ups to that feeling . in a situation with no credible danger ( young black man on the beach ? ) because as you pointed out , fear is emotional , and anxiety is not good for processing rationally . the important part is being conscious of it , understanding the effects that your response has on others , and actually being in control of how it affects your thinking ."
9oeiuf,"bicameralism is n't a justified model . i am posting this because i have had problems finding adequate justification and arguments for the model of bicameralism , or the practice of having two legislative chambers in a democratic state . in order for an upper house to have any distinction from a lower house , it needs to be formed differently . usually this means it is made up by appointment ( by panels , leader of government , or other ) like the irish séanad , by election using a more indirect system like the french senate , or vocation such as the lords spiritual in the house of lords . the fundamental difference as such for most upper houses is that they 're less democratic . why exactly should a less democratic institution have the authority to ' check and balance ' the more representative chamber of the country ? you may say that through whatever means they 're more qualified or experienced , and provide a rational foil . but the means are arbitrary and have vague justification . this explains why the upper chambers in most countries differ from each other so much . i can understand the context they were created in , but what is the justification for them now ? i 'm a fairly stubborn person , but i 'd like to reconsider on this view just based on the fact i have n't known where to look for the arguments for .","each representative in the house represents an equal number of people . the us senate exists to give each state an equal number of representatives , regardless of population . ( california , texas , new york , florida , pennsylvania , illinois , ohio , georgia , north carolina ) . if this were a pure democracy , these 9 states could band together and oppress the other 41 states . you can form distinct bases of representation even without having the upper house elected on a different base than the lower one . the australian house of representatives is elected on a majoritarian basis - and is typically dominated by the two major parties there , labor and the liberal/national coalition , while their senate is elected proportionally to the vote share each party recieves - and is both not dominated by a single party and gives representation to smaller parties . before the 17th amendment , the state legislatures selected the federal senators to serve , rather than popular vote determining who the federal senators are . if you have a guy in the house of representatives , he is elected every 2 years . this puts a lot of pressure on him to be accountable for his people . however , he likely wo n't gain much experience if his term is up after only 2 years and ca n't improve much during that time . if you have a guy in the senate , you have someone who is elected once every 6 years . however , the 6 years gives him more time and experience to be a better senator . 4 people 18-15 , 4 people 70 + , 6 men , 6 women , and overenforced ethnic representation . this could be put in place to stop publicly opposed but parliamentary supported bills . or bills that are highly publicly supported but poor choices , that incumbents are directed to support by the electorate ."
9oe4m6,"elizabeth warren should not identify as part-native american first , let ’s get the facts out of the way . elizabeth warren does have native american ancestors . evidence shows that she is at most 1/512th native american . which means she is , optimistically speaking , 0.19 % native american . most news sources leave that number out . she has publically identified as part-native american ( and has done some questionable things in relation to that identity ) . look , i get that this is a dangerous argument to make . it lightly smells of the whole 3/5ths thing , but hey , 3 / 5 = 60 % , which is over 315 times the amount of native american that elizabeth warren is ( at best ) . i think my issue with her heritage is not about percentages or gene purity or whathaveyou . it ’s more related to being “ white-passing ” ... poc who are white-passing can simultaneously have “ white privilege ” and also face discrimination/prejudice for being “ too white ” to fit in comfortably with poc and “ too other-y ” to fit in with white folks . except it ’s worse , because poc who are white-passing are usually less than 511/512 white elizabeth warren should not identify as part-native american nor should she co-opt poc issues as her own . she should continuing advocating for native americans and poc , but it is disingenuous to claim a native american heritage .","there are no "" poc issues "" ; there are just human issues which may affect poc more than others ; these are things we all should care about regardless of how we identify ourselves . i 'm a euro-american mutt , but if i try to help native americans in public events , i 'm not "" co-opting "" anything . native americans were pretty thoroughly slaughtered first , and since then , conditions for their communities have been pretty terrible . even besides that , many native american communities have generally been living pretty closely with non natives ( especially small ones , after all , that 's where the jobs often are ) so , the net result of this is that native americans are , by and large , pretty intermixed . states that have a bunch of slaves wanted more representation , such that each slave added to their population count as 1 . this is usually refered to as the "" one drop rule "" where we started to actually legally decide what someone is based on whatever criteria we cared about at the time rather than letting them decide based on their experience . this definitely did n't require 3/5ths african blood to be considered african though , i think in most states it was 1/16 or 1/32 . the results of this were that if you were a native american and your great grandfather was black , despite you never knowing him and not looking at all like he did , the government could now consider you black . i 'm white passing , but both of my parents were born in cuba and did n't move to the us until they were older than 10 years old . my parents are ( for the most part ) white passing , too . i think your argument is more that elizabeth warren should identify as possessing white privilege , which is n't , in and of itself , mutually incompatible with identifying as part-native american . i think that would be someone who is biracial but appears white , choosing to hide their ethnicity . the rest of your cmv relates to things that have nothing to do with anything elizabeth warren has ever said or done . the current head of the cherokee nation is 3.12 % native american . much more to the point , can you cite a place where she is leveraging her native american heritage to "" make poc issues ... her own ? "" i 've only ever seen her bring up her heritage in the context of being attacked for lying about her heritage . it 's a valid concern that it would detract from real native americans if the identity was used by somebody who was for all intents and purposes white . maybe it would be different if there were more full-blooded native americans in congress . the evidence of the generational test is that she has native american ancestors at 6 generations back ."
9obhbx,"the sexual assault survivor ( sas ) empowerment movement has gone offtrack and is now giving victims and potential victims exaggerated senses of severity first off , i 'm a male , asian , liberal . i fight along side the sas , have never been sexually assaulted and have not sexually assaulted anyone . i am also well aware that i might be speaking from a position of privilege , inexperience , and ignorance . today i had a debate with a female friend who is a sas . during which , i expressed my view that there should be classification of degrees of severity to the actions that are currently lumped together as "" sexual assault "" , because otherwise , everything is immediately compared to rape and pushed to the extreme . surely putting your arm around someone 's waist is not comparable to raping them ? both in laws ( minor and major ) , and in the sense that the effects suffered by the victims - whether physically , psychologically , and for however long - differ greatly . therefore , going around screaming murder at the slightest action will turn or scare the undecided people off , even turn them to the other side , where the rhetoric of imminent False accusations on men is all so relatable and convenient , and it wo n't teach the assailants anything in the long term . to me , this movement should not be just about condemnation and justice , but also about education . we do n't educate just by threats of punishments , we need to also elaborate in details , with clarity of classifications . my argument is that , we on the left prefer to be right than to be effective , and i think effectiveness is how we can win this fight . this was rebutted in a way that make me feel like i was the one who wronged my friend , not as someone who 's trying to advice and help . my friend 's counterargument was that the victims have been hurt , silenced and nice for long enough , and that does n't work . it 's time to shout loud and clear and stop everything on its track , does n't matter how "" small "" or "" trivial "" . it was explained to me that the actions however big or small are essentially the same , and the effects suffered are definitely comparable . she was willing to make everyone uncomfortable , including the neutral ones who did nothing wrong , to make them feel and sympathise with the pain and suffering of the victims . i do n't agree with this hostility and aggressiveness , and i think the sense of severity has been exaggerated by the over-empowerment . i do n't think as neutral onlookers who is trying to help , we should have to suffer and guilt-tripped to be able to sympathise . someone else chimed in and said i was talking too much left-right politics and trying to gaslight and accuse her of being irrationally angry just because she was a woman , and there must be some underlying conditioned views . i desperately want to see it their way . please change my view .","first , as a man , i have been witness first-hand to conversation between exclusively men about these subjects , so i feel i have some insight into how at least some small portion of men approach the subject . limiting the discussion solely to the types of men who are likely to be sexually aggressive without prompt , the general attitude they take to this discussion is , "" i will take what i can get . "" now remove my gender from this and realize that not everyone is going to be fully aware of whether or not they are dealing with this type of man , or whether they are arguing in good faith or bad faith . as such , when these men argue that "" touching someone 's waist without asking is n't the same degree of harmful as touching their breasts or genitals without asking , "" to someone who does not know their intentions , it can very reasonably come across as an attempt to pave the way for such actions to be more acceptable , however slightly - ridiculing people who think touching someone 's waist = "" rape , "" rather than addressing the question of whether or not it 's okay to touch a woman 's waist without asking in the first place ( which is usually what is being discussed ) . unless this argument is made in direct response to the claim that "" touching a woman 's waist = rape , "" this is a strawman or misunderstanding at best , red herring / deliberate deflection at worst - an attempt to exaggerate the argument and caricature "" the left "" as an abstract , rather than address the legitimate question of whether or not it is acceptable to touch a woman 's waist , etc. without her consent . and whether you are one of those men or not , there are men out there who are so desperate to get some kind of sexual contact that they will often bite the bullet and deal with consequences that are supposed to disincentivize such behaviors , because they feel they can afford the consequences ( especially if the only consequence is an unverifiable allegation that can be easily hushed with money or legal action ) . when it 's brought up out of context , it can paint an even poorer picture of the man 's intentions in that context - if we are talking about whether or not you should go in for a hug without consent , and you shift the conversation to be about whether hugging counts as "" rape "" ( which nobody stated in that context ) , then it betrays the perspective you are bringing to that conversation - that you might find such behaviors acceptable and so you are trying to invalidate or supercede the concerns of people who do not wish to be touched in that way , to pave the way for a potential future situation where you are going to attempt to do so in some way . i can relate to people who do n't want to be hugged , kissed , held , etc. by people they do n't know , regardless of gender . and so when i see a man coming into a conversation about whether or not you have a right to not be touched as a woman , taking the tone that "" well it 's not rape , "" that does n't really address the complaint and it also gives me the impression of someone who is acting in bad faith - as if our only choices are to allow flat-out rape , or allow all unwarranted touching . the only context in which it matters to what degree a type of touching is unwarranted is a legal one . if someone is saying "" you should be prosecuted for rape if you hug someone without their permission , "" then obviously i think that 's an argument that should be had out ( and there are legal categories of sexual assault for this reason ) . however in the context of casual or professional discussion , i think the rule of thumb should be , "" do n't ever touch someone unless you are prompted to do so , "" rather than "" argue at length about what degree of unwarranted touching should be acceptable . "" you do n't hug someone during a heated discussion , you wait until it 's resolved amicably and the other person holds up their arms prompting you to do so . if anything a hungover person tries to ignore it rather than focus and exaggerate it . how many times a week etc. and exaggerating how far or how much , totally caught in it . then again , maybe a small percentage of folks like the status of victim and may be focused on it . from what i understand , the stigma for rape victims is huge . i think victims might focus hard to make sense of things and gain control . if some guy and his buddy almost gang banged your ass , let ’s say they tried hard but could n’t get your jeans all the way down ... just came on your back or face or something ... would you focus on that , try to make sense of it ? you were n’t raped per se due to some states statutes , but you ’d certainly feel assaulted and try to make sense why . i 'm not convinced anymore that there 's a "" reasonable center "" of people who would be sympathetic but just have n't heard the right argument yet . those reasonable people have already taken sides and , like you , have nuanced opinions but largely support one side over another . when an issue is argued passionately , these people are more likely to side with the far-reaching rhetoric over the careful , nuanced view . exact implementation of policy is really the only concrete thing that matters , and all the rhetoric does is serve to electrify people to the causes that underly existing legislation . in other words , the degrees of sexual assault you 're claiming should exist already do exist , because courts that implement existing policy will always look at the facts and render a verdict commensurate with the severity of the crime . it is a subjective assessment , sure , and there have been times when justice was not carried out evenly , but the need to subdivide these crimes is far less than the need to educate people about sexual assault . that said , i do not tend to see people arguing that all sexual assault or rape is the same . sometimes , i see people arguing that the bare minimum of punishment for sexual assault is still the same , i.e. it 's all bad enough that people who have committed it should n't have positions of authority or power , but that is n't quite the same thing . if your argument was specifically that , i du n no , louis c.k. or al franken or whoever had too much done to them because "" it was n't that bad "" , i can see why people were upset with you ; if your friends honestly think everybody should get 20 years in prison for any sort of sexual misconduct or something then they 're probably being unreasonable , but i ca n't know that from your retelling of the conversation . i 'm not sure what you 're trying to say here - there already are legal classifications of sexual assault . however , rape has a definition , and while it can vary by jurisdiction , no one is saying an arm around the waist is rape . it 's a violation , probably battery , or sa depending on the circumstances , but unlikely to be considered rape . however , while not inherently sexual , that kind of touch is fairly intimate . sas are hollering about it more because people are n't paying attention to the systemic problems that are associated with sa or sexual harassment . people who have never experienced this pattern of unwanted behavior targeted at them do not understand , or they do n't understand why even small things are problematic . your friend was n't mad because she was a woman , she was mad because she 's frustrated at being constantly second guessed about her own life experiences and her reality . the other argument would be that , rather than individual actions being less or more severe than others , #metoo and associated movements are examining the severity of repeated patterns of behaviour from the perspective of survivors/victims and what can be said about people who exhibit that behavior as well as those that allow or excuse it . while there have been cases where guns were jumped or single cases made the headlines , most of the entire thing has focused on situations of volume . less "" a hand around the waist one time is bad "" and more "" ten people who barely know me have put their hands on my waist "" or "" x has put their hands on the waists of people who were uncomfortable so often that their nickname is the the waister "" and what that says about cultures that do n't repudiate that behavior . of course groping someone 's behind is n't the same thing as any form of rape but why do so many people have groping stories ? while i ’ve never heard anyone proclaiming that unwanted touching is equivalent to something like rape , the unified message is that people should not be subject to any kind of sexual assault . the problem with categorizing things be severity in principle is that it makes it seem like it ’s more acceptable ( even if still not acceptable ) to do something like touch someone in a sexual way as long as you did n’t rape them . to put it perhaps more simply , touching someone in an unwanted sexual way is already 100 % unacceptable , so there is n’t really a point to make distinctions when advocating on behalf of sas . now legally , we can accept that there are degrees of punishment based on severity , the same way there are degrees of punishment for something like assault . if one person punched someone because of a heated argument , the punishment may be less severe than if someone targeted a minority individual and beat them to an inch of their life ."
9oa6az,"i refuse to call my self feminist due the historical background of the word first things first . i 'm a 30 year old white man . i support any policy that ensures equal rights for both sexes , all races and sexualities . due to this i would call myself an equalist but refuse to be called feminist . not because i do n't support women ’s rights but because the historical package of the term . feminism started in late 1800 as a woman 's right movement and still these two terms are synonyms in minds of many . for them being a feminist is about thriving for better rights for women . this is further enforced by the fact that many outlets ( including wikipedia ) use womanpower icon as a symbol for feminist . then why is this all bad in my view . well there are several reasons . one is that i do n't want to be associated with radical feminist . other is that there are lot of issues concerning mistreatment of men and mistreatment of different sexualities or races . these issues ( especially men ’s rights ) often become secondary within feminist agenda . by separating myself as an eqalist i can express larger range of my views in a single term instead going as feminist , pro-gay , pro-black , pro-white , pro-lgbt etc . here are some common counter arguments that i have heard and my take on them . 1 . words change meaning in time and \ [ they \ ] define feminism as eqalism . that is all good and nice but that does n't change the fact that lot of people still find words feminism and women 's right movement as synonyms . for example finnish wikipedia ( i 'm native finnish ) define feminist as a "" -- a radical movement aimed at improving women 's social status and changing gender roles . "" english wikipedia is bit more modern on this issue but still many define feminism as a women 's right movement . how a single person define their own views or words do n't really matter to me . 2 . as a white man i do n't know what oppression is this argument is as dumb as saying that doctors do n't what it is like to be sick like their patients and therefor should n't be allowed to treat them . not being a part of oppressed does n’t mean that you ca n’t be part of the force correcting policies . 3 . feminist is n't same as radical feminist no they are not but by using different term that describe larger underlying view ( equal rights and treatments as humans ) i can make a clear separation from historical movement and its radical parts . it 's similar to nra . lot of pro-gun people want to make a separation in their statements that they do n't support the radical parts of nra and therefor do n't support nra at all even if they are pro-gun . there is n’t history of equalist burning bras or rioting . 4 . not identifying as a feminist means you do n’t support equal treatment of women not True . i oppose any policy that defines rights to one gender , race or sexuality or outlines one population outside said rights . i vote for gay-marriage , anti-discriminatory laws and equal pay policies . but i wo n’t support policies that give women privilege over men for example there was a university policy where women got into certain fields easier than men because women where underrepresented in said fields . women should have same grades then men if they want to study in same classroom and vice versa . to change my view you have to give a clear example where term feminist would be more beneficial that term eqalist .","feminism is a big political tent and all kinds of people gather there . you do n't want to be "" a feminist "" because of what it means to be a person like that . ( 1 ) the rewards and burdens of society should be distributed equally to men and women . specifically , women receive fewer explicit rewards ( like money , power , and status ) , and bear more invisible burdens ( like those related to childcare and domestic duties ) . it means i work with other feminists to achieve common goals . well everyone claims they are working towards some sense of equality . just because feminism has this baggage to it does n't mean you ca n't use that word , equal has baggage to it as well . you just have to give more details and say "" i agree with feminists about this but i 'm rather moderate so i disagree with many on this "" . most people have a bit more complexity to their take on the issue . but they still use the word because people know what it is and it 's well established . and as far as addressing the mistreatment of sexualities and genders , only feminists are doing that . a lot of the vocal opposition to feminism has been from people calling themselves similar terms to what you 're choosing - are n't you just as likely to end up having people think you 're a part of the mra and having to explain that the same way a non-radical self identified feminist has to ? as long as you want everyone to be equal then you 're all good , why does it matter what you call it ? if you stand up for the rights of women , stand up for the word women use to describe those who stands up for the rights of women . so , i 'm not sure what you think a radical feminist is . the biggest thing we have to people fighting for mens rights are feminists . the movement for paid parental leave is a feminist movement , but men benefit . when gender roles are not crushing and strict , everyone benefits . say they do n't care ? what they will probably do is see it though the lens of their background - the perception of men as violent and dangerous is the flip side of seeing women as passive and docile . the feminists i know are also passionate about equal rights for races and sexism orientation and economic background . "" equalist "" does n't exist as a term or social movement . if you refer to yourself as that in conversation , you 'd have to then go on to explain what that term means to you because it is n't a defined term in society ."
9o9s5j,"states should not exist in the usa states should not exist . as a concept , states were enshrined in the constitution truly as a compromise ( indeed the constitution is a document full of compromises from the structure of the legislature to the bill of rights ) so that the colonies would have a reason to join . obviously , however , there are no longer 13 colonies who need to be persuaded to join our union . what i fail to see is how states are moral really at all . how is it that the rights of people within a country can literally differ based on which particular part of the country you were born in ? education , transportation , voting , etc , can differ meaningfully whether you live in vermont or arizona . "" so why not apply this to all borders ? what makes someone in turkey worthy of less rights than someone in texas just because they were born there ? "" exactly . unfortunately , the us is n't in a place to afford the same education , for instance , to those born in turkey even if every citizen unanimously decided for such an action . the senate ( perhaps the most unjust political body in the nation ) gives people in wyoming about 70 times more voting power than someone in california for a reason i ca n't explain . not an issue if there are n't states . "" well this way you can just move to the state you find most appealing and enjoy whatever rights their citizens have voted for themselves . "" i find this particular argument extremely unconvincing , not least because moving states is significantly harder than this implies . but yeah basically explain why you legitimately think that people ought to have different rights especially before they 're 18 and allowed to even vote because of where in the country they 're born , and why someone in wyoming has 70 times the say in the senate that a californian does and it 's 100 % okay .","states can be "" laboratories of democracy , "" places where we try out new and crazy laws to see what works and what does n't . it 's a lot easier to convince the federal government that there will be no problem legalizing marijuana if you have a track record that it has worked in five different states and counting . if you tried to launch this at the federal level , first of all it would never pass , and second there 's the fact that if there were problems involved in a new policy , then only the states that implemented it would be "" ruined . "" also , moving states to get access to laws you like is n't really that hard if you 're talking about the northeastern states or a person who lives on a state border . the electoral college and senate do n't really have anything to do with having different laws in different states . that would make it irrelevant to the carrying capacity of the state as the citizens provide for themselfs . it 's easier for a population of ten million ( 41 states are less than this ) to displace a corrupt government than it is for a population of 320 million . if the federal government starts doing what the people do n't want , we have the states to oppose such moves . just look at all the state lawsuits against trump to see this in action . the ten most populous states have over half the population , so if they got together to force a policy the rest of the states would n't matter . they would would rule the country , and would not likely care much about the wishes of the rest of the population . so we have the house to give people a vote by population , and the senate to give people a vote by state . as to rights , since the 14th amendment we are all citizens of both the state and the usa . as such , the federal government can go after a state that is violating the rights of its citizens . they do n't always , but then if they 're not doing it , then you obviously have a federal government that does n't much care for the right , and would you want that federal government governing you directly ? at least with states , your state can protect the right the federal government does n't care about . having state law be separate from federal law allows for legislative changes to be experimented with on a small scale before total legal implementation . but a couple states wanted it , so washington and colorado passed it . they started making extra tax revenue , and there were n't terrible side effects regarding rampant underage use and traffic-related deaths , so other states started getting in on the act . in 20 years , id say it 's likely that at least 1/2 the country will have some form of legal recreational marijuana , and we have already seen this shift happen with medicinal marijuana . that sort of widespread change is helped by having smaller areas of the country to experiment with , as the majority of the us has needed some convincing that legal marijuana would not be a disaster . without the laboratory of the states to experiment in , marijuana would almost certainly still be illegal everywhere . i live in a 0 % tax state and have no interest in adopting the california or new york model . it seems to me that your argument against states could be just as well used as an argument against the existence of all countries . but it looks like instead you 're advocating for removing states while keeping the federal government in place . in order to be consistent i think you need to advocate for the removal of all countries and advocate some form of either anarchistic self-government or world-government . historically the independent countries of massachusetts , new hampshire , rhode island , etc. decided to form a federation . this federal government was supposed to take over certain tasks . the states delegated the authority for those tasks and those only to the federal government . the point of the federal government has been to take care of a limited amount of responsibilities , like common defense and establishing free trade among the states that joined the union . it 's role has n't been the establishment of a government of the same magnitude as the individual states . "" the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution , nor prohibited by it to the states , are reserved to the states respectively , or to the people . "" meaning : any task that is n't explicitly delegated to the federal government stays with the states and the people . now you can argue that the federal government should have much broader powers and take over all the tasks of the states . that 's essentially the formation of a new legal entity because it would require a completely new constiution or complete revision of the current constitution . if that 's the case you should instead argue for the formation of a one-world government that takes over responsibilities of all countries on earth . of course if you remove all the states/countries with one big government , you 'll remove all competition between countries and governments . whatever that government decides to be law , will be law everywhere and people have no option to flee to a place that suits them better . a one-world government is great , if it guarantees your liberty and does n't turn out to be tyrannical , but who can guarantee that it wo n't happen when you have a tiny amount of people with such broad powers in charge of a gigantic population ? in the us , you 've had slavery and fortunately slaves at least had an option to try to flee to states that protected them from being exploited . if the us was just one legal blob , a lot of slaves that fled north would not have had the option because it may well have been legal everywhere . the more states you have , the more protection you have against overall encroachment of liberties . you have more chances that somewhere , someone will stand up for you and protect you , like multiple states are now doing with weed . states provide another layer of protection from tyranny by providing competition in legal frameworks . it 'd be nice if all states and countries would equally respect the liberties of their people , but that 's simply impossible . you seem to assume that one big federal government would only do the right things and remedy all the problems that individual states have . i think you need to argue why that would be the case when at least on the surface it seems just as likely that the federal government may adopt a lot of the bad policies that you find in some of the worse states . i disagree that states should not exist for this very reason . different peoples have different desires and different problems . this is why we have regulations from the federal level , the state level , all the way down to regulations for your neighborhood . the federal level regulates with a broad brush , in which individual states can choose to build upon those regulations . the people that belong to that state vote on representation to fight for what they want . using education , the federal government sets up the minimal requirements for education throughout the country . why should california or new york dictate to the population of north dakota on how they should live their life ? just because they are minority in population does not mean that they should not be able to have an equal say in senate . california has 53 members in the house of representatives while wyoming has one . this comparision is 1 californian representative for 746,037 people ( est ) , compared to the 1 wyoming representative for 579315 people ( est. ) . the senate is based of states and the representatives are based off population . congress is combined both the house and senate , granting california 55 seats to wyomings 3 . its about balance and equal representation amongst the american people . federal level dictates the minimum and state and city level fine tunes to their area to their liking . over the pond in europe their countries are often similar to the size of our states . states are nice because it gives people the liberty to move between the states in order to live with laws they like and to get away from laws they do not like . for example , people move out of california in order to enjoy drinking soda from plastic straws . not everyone has the same political views , so leaving major issues to the states gives everyone the opportunity to be happy . without the states everyone would have to deal with being abused by the majority with no escape . to put things in context - the usa has about 300m people spread across 3.8 m square miles . europe has about 500m people spread across 3.9 m square miles . the usa has 50 states , the eu has 28 countries - europe in total has 44 countries . if you want to compare , the usa by scale and government really is more analogous to the eu than to a single nation . local areas ( european countries/states ) are self governed according to their own local cultural desires and needs , whereas the entire continent is held together through larger overarching diplomatic representation to the centralised authority ( eu/federal government ) . california may need laws restricting water use , but in an area with a more abundant supply , such a law would only be detrimental . with respect to legal representation , the split between the house and the senate exists for this reason . senators were not originally elected by popular vote ; their appointment was determined by their state legislatures . congress allows for one house in which each state has equal rights , and one house in which each state has rights proportional to their population . two counter arguments ; first , consider that what you are arguing for is coming close to an argument for a True democracy ; i.e. each person being able to vote for each issue with majority vote ruling . i would consider that this risks a majority party ruling to trump the interests , concerns , or potentially even the rights of minority groups . dividing power among states is a way to mitigate this , reducing the risks of that exploitation . for example , say we had a particularly bad federal leader , with a ton of federal power . for every federal decision that leader makes , all states are evenly affected - even those that violently oppose said leader . if said leader has lesser federal powers , and states had more local powers , each state would be less affected by the federal decision . certainly , a similar issue could happen at a state level , but i find it less likely that such a close majority/minority split would occur in each of 50 states . a nitpick - a lot of the examples you mention , including transportation and education , are more appropriately considered government provided services . suggesting these things are rights implies that some person or entity must exist to provide these things for you . rights are protected under the federal constitution which every state must follow . if we did not have states , these groups would have to settle on a compromise and neither would be fully happy with the outcome ; since we do have states , people in both groups get exactly what they want . is your view that the united states should move from a federal structure ( e.g. , usa , germany , australia ) to a unitary structure similar to japan or france ? the reason is to protect the rights of the smaller states . are you open to having your view changed based on arguments not related to "" different rights "" and the voting imbalance in the senate ? if you are open to other avenues of argument , then i would ask : do you think the concept of a province is acceptable for any country ? nevada , for example , has legal gambling and prostitution because it 's inhabited by people who , on the whole , want these things more than the people of other states . there 's no one set of laws that works best for everyone , and people on different ends of a large country may not understand each other 's needs . states , just like local municipalities , are a compromise between one set of laws for everyone and a unique set of laws for each person . however , i would argue that the culture is not the reason for different states . for example , the importance of farming is not equal in all states . also , labor laws regarding it will differ in california and say illinois , due to the vastly different kinds of crops found there . i will agree with you that moving states is harder than implied . moreover , it helps to create competition for business , as states must be careful not to alienate industry with respect to other states . ( larger states have more electoral votes ) the house of representatives is population based . ( at least in theory ) . this helps to give a voice to the minority , while being balanced by the house and executive branch . people from large states wanted representation by population and people from small states wanted it equal by state . the "" great compromise "" was the setup we have now where the senate is by state and the house is by population . link this is made law by article 1 of the constitution . just to add on about democratic representation ; if you totalled the population of all 13 original starts , it would be roughly the same as modern day oregon . 40 years ago almost a third of us were n't here i think it makes sense to have the state/provincial system in countries because managing all of the infrastructure on such a local level would be incredibly difficult for just federal workers , especially if they 're completely disconnected from the cultural differences from state to state . some states may believe one thing as a majority that a different state disagrees on ."
9o8ot6,"america is the number 1 country in freedom of speech it 's pretty common to deride america as number one in nothing ( or number one in only bad things such as gun ownership ) but we are the best at freedom of speech . from showing a bloody decapitated head of donald trump , the current president , radical muslim imams preaching hateful and antisemitic sermons , or feminists protesting on the steps of the highest court of the country , as long as there is no violence ( and sometimes even violence is allowed ) , even the most radical ideas can be espoused . muslims do n't have to worry about laws banning their burkas or disallowing the building of minarets . the same is True for idiotic hate speech by conservatives and right-wingers : anti-government protests with the protesters carrying guns , kkk marches in districts populated with holocaust supporters , etc . in europe , they jail or fine people for saying the wrong thing on the internet or denying the holocaust or making fun of muslims . note : i 'm not arguing ( although i do believe it ) that this freedom of speech is good . only that america is the most liberal in the classical sense of freedom of speech .","i would say something like the hollywood blacklist of the 1940s-50s should count as restricting freedom of speech , even though it was for the most part carried out by private interests rather than the government . it is federally legal in the us to fire an employee based on their political speech outside of work . while this is not de jure restriction on speech , it is de facto restriction . some countries have much stricter rules about firing someone . this may mean ( depending on how you define it ) that you have more de facto free speech in another country even though your legal right to free speech is broader in the us . first , it seems odd to link feminist protests holding a protest as similar to "" radical muslim imams "" or "" showing a bloody , decapitated head of donald trump . "" the latter are both to a greater or lesser extent calls for violence or revolution , while a political protest is n't really the same thing . second , and more to the point of the op : the united states has freedom of speech in theory , but also has a growing environment in which reporting and other actions of free speech are attacked and undermined . for example , your very point above equating a political protest to violent calls for revolution serves to dismiss speech you do n't want to hear as violent rhetoric , eliminating its power . or , more broadly , attacks on the press by the trump administration and the growing cries of "" fake news "" from ( primarily ) right wing publications and spheres leads to both a dismissal of free speech and an environment in which it 's more likely reporters are threatened or attacked for using their free speech . for instance , reporters without borders compiles a report on the press freedom in various countries , taking into account both hate speech legislation and the "" soft "" examples of mitigations on press freedom like anti-press rhetoric , reporters feeling they must self-censor to avoid retribution , violence against reporters , etc . this links more broadly to the point that "" freedom of speech "" is not the only factor that goes into actually having a compelling or useful discourse , but you 've already stated that 's outside of the purpose of this thread . let 's say someone pointed you to a first-world country with mild limitations on "" hate speech "" , but more than the us . they also had less restrictive copyright law , more acceptance of threats , fewer restrictions on treason , fewer restrictions on obscenity , more limited libel/defamation law , fewer protections of government secrecy , weaker contract law ( where it would limit future speech ) , more press protections , and no history of government hearings on "" un-american activities "" ."
9o8dyl,"the government should take away the children of parents who refuse to vaccinate refusal to vaccinate a healthy child is not only putting the child at risk , but putting thousands of other children who medically can not be vaccinated at risk as well . i believe this to be a form of child endangerment , and any parent who chooses to not vaccinate their kids is an unfit parent . i will not hear out any arguments that vaccines cause autism , or that the potential side effects of vaccines outweigh the benefits . anybody who believes that vaccines are detrimental to public health is stupid , and anybody who is willing to put a child 's life at risk does not deserve to be a parent .","since everyone else will point out the common sense reasons , why not be wary of armed revolt when the government starts kidnapping and forcibly injecting children with foreign substances ? i do n't care what 's in the syringe , the government should n't be able to forcibly take your children away from you and inject them with something . we do n't need to create a dystopia where the government kidnaps children and injects them with substances . let 's meet in the middle and say that unvaccinated children ca n't go to public schools . i understand the dangers of not vaccinating a child , and believe that it is important to do so . yet , the government should not get involved as it upholds the grounds on which parents can refuse vaccines . yes it ’s dangerous , but parents have the freedom and the right to choose whether or not to vaccinate their children . as much as i think that anti-vaxxers are a bunch of paranoid morons , taking away the children from their parents hurt the children more than not . an unvaccinated child with a loving family ( though a stupid one ) will be more happy than a vaccinated child in foster care . child protective services ( aka “ the government ” ) does n’t typically take children away from their parents unless the child is in immediate danger . an unvaccinated child can still have some protection through herd immunity , and have a low risk of contracting a disease we commonly vaccinate for . to start i will say that i completely agree that parents who choose not to vaccinate are endangering not only their child , but all of the other children around them . rather than taking the children away and forcing them into other situations that will more than likely be dangerous or abusive ( foster system needs help too ) , we should educate them . if someone decides they do n’t want to vaccinate their child , they should be required by law to take a class explaining what they are , how they work , the repercussions of not getting them , how the serious side effects generally only happen with immune system abnormalities and it is n’t the fault of the vaccine , etc . taking the kids away directly is extremely unethical , especially if you ’re arguing about the ethics of vaccinating . parents that do n't vaccinate their children are doing so out of love ."
9o8bw0,"a rape culture exists in the u.s. definition of rape culture : "" a society or environment whose prevailing social attitudes have the effect of normalizing or trivializing sexual assault and abuse . "" a culture like this does exist in the u.s : prison culture how many times have people heard the phrase : "" do n't drop the soap "" a countless number of times . that is a direct allusion to rape and people trivialize it . it 's almost expected in prison . when someone goes to prison people say : "" i hope that person gets raped "" that is normalizing rape . that is the definition of rape culture . a society who 's prevailing social attitudes trivialize and normalize rape . a rape culture exists in the u.s.","however , you have not shown that this is the prevailing sentiment , as in the view of the majority or the view that has the most appeal or influence in american society . since this has not been established , your argument for rape culture existing can not be said to be True . one could argue that the prison system does not count because the "" people "" in that system are not actually considered people and rape is an act that is done to a human person by definition . just based off of depictions in the media i would say that murder is often much more trivialized than rape . i would suggest that prison is not representative of culture in any way . i do n't think it 's any more accurate to say prison is representative of us culture than it is to say we have a typewriter culture . if you were to say "" rape culture exists in us prisons , it would be accurate . i wo n’t argue against your point that the u.s. has bad attitudes toward sexual assault , but i think it is fair to say it is unfair to judge the morality of a society based on its jokes and moments of nonviolent anger . when someone says a do n’t drop the soap joke they are pointing out the flaws of our system in a humorous way . before those jokes circulated male rape in prisons was an unknown issue . by your definition a society that ignores rape would not be a rape culture but one that is aware but makes some jokes about it would be , and i find that unfair . on your point of “ i hope they get raped ” comment , people ca n’t be judged morally for what they say into a void in a vacuum about emotional topics . everyone says things they do n’t mean at points of anger , and we should n’t be judged as a society for that , in my opinion . so the numbers of rape and sexual assault in prison are inflated because all sexual activity is illegal and qualifies as sexual assault or rape . also , the phrase "" rape culture "" is a feminist term from the 1970s that is defined as "" a setting in which rape is pervasive and normalized due to societal attitudes about gender and sexuality . "" feminists by definition are only concerned with women 's issues , and women are only about 10 % of the us prison population , so prison rape is n't really want feminists care about . moreover , prison rape laws are not about gender and sexuality as much as protecting inmates from each other and from staff , and seek the opposite of normalizing rape . now , the attitude that prisoners will be raped or should be raped as punishment is horrible . unfortunately , most americans are obsessed with punishment and retribution , so those prison rape comments are common . i still do not think this is a rape culture though ; i just think most people in the us are just wishing for a certain criminal to experience as much punishment and pain as possible . i see this as part of "" violence culture "" more than "" rape culture . "" if there 's a rape culture , then there 's also a murder culture . prisoners are removed from society , that 's the point of prisons . you could also say "" a murder culture exists in the us "" , because there are plenty of people in prison who think murder is fine does it make any sense to extrapolate their views to the general population ? so you 're correct that a rape culture is physically located in the us . that culture has been isolated and contained because the prevailing culture of the u.s. condemns rape and rapists . i 'd like to underline the common mindset that a lot of rape allegations are True until proven innocence , i do n't think that 's something that would happen in a rape culture ."
9o88lc,"the united states needs a price cap on pharmaceuticals . the united states is the only developed country with low medical standards . it spends more money on medicine and pharma than any other country , and yet still has low quality . plus , if there was a cap and prices were lowered , it is more likely that important things ( ie . epi pen ) will become public information , allowing them to be more heavily researched , thus allowing for more development of pharma . and on top of all of that , because the united states owns the majority of pharma production , if they have a cap , it will set standards for other countries that a ) do not have price caps b ) do not have enough medicine , or high quality medicine btw , sorry if the formatting is bad , i 'm on mobile .","the solution is a tariff system where pharma companies have to sell their drugs for the same price internationally as they do domestically - wherever that price point levels off . prices go down in the us and the rest of the world picks up their share that was subsidized by the us . of course , the problem is a lot of the rest of the world wo n't pay for new drugs at the new cost . it would likely put a huge strain on the funding for socialized medicine worldwide and drop patient outcomes by using older and potentially less effective/less safe drugs . pharmaceuticals should be treated like every other good in the market . allow more companies to produce the same product and the supply will increase to a point of affordability . television and other electronics have are cheaper than ever as a result of being able to buy from companies all over the world , and the availability of access . unlike prescriptions drugs that can not be purchased legally over borders . the supply is so shortened and the patent laws are so long that companies can have monopolies on a specific product , ie epipens ( spelling does n't appear to be correct ) . allow the free market to supply to the people as it is intended to do so . drug companies are allowed to extend patent monopoly by minor tweaks to the original underlying patent . the scandal is the patent laws , not what someone shooses to or not to do with the government granted monopoly . but what is worse is the cost of healthcare that gets pushed onto the average person due to other people not being insured . the costs of healthcare are basically pushed onto patients that do have insurance . as more poor people ca n't afford care , the price hospitals charge goes up , and this gets billed to patients with insurance . it is questionable as to if there can legally be price caps placed on medications in the us . putting price caps on medicine would reduce research and development because ( 1 ) there would be less money for pharmaceutical companies to put into r&d , and ( 2 ) because it would kill incentive to produce new drugs . as you pointed out , the us owns the majority of pharma production . that 's because we do n't have price caps on pharmaceuticals . firstly a price ceiling above the equilibrium point would lower supply of the medicine . less producers would be involved as it is not profitable . this would also increase unemployment costing many people there jobs . i do n't understand the assumption that these patents would suddenly become public if a price ceiling was in place . rather what would happen is that price would be cut but there would be no incentive to make their patents public . secondly could you link the research saying that america has the low quality medicine . competition is the driving force of r&d so if a company was to make a public patent why would anyone put r&d into it . lastly i do n't understand the argument in the comments why r&d in the medical region is bad . i think you ignore some fundamental concepts such as competition and price ceilings i would revisit those concepts then revisit your argument . in order to have a price cap , you have to have a price . because of insurance secret contracts , rebates , government subsidies and kick back , there is no real market for pharmaceuticals . then the price of the pill should reflect the recoup of development plus the cost of manufacturing plus some profit for the company . there is no reason to believe that the united states should follow the steps of other developed nations . you have identified an issue ; the value of money spent on a good is not equivalent to the value of the quality of consuming the good , but why do price caps solve this problem ? the development of more new pharmaceuticals is an issue that is somewhat disjointed from the issue of the price cap of pharmaceuticals . research and public information can be spurred without price caps on pharmaceuticals . why should improving global standards be the goal of the american government with regards to the regulation of goods in domestic markets ? you are saying american ( with its low quality of medicine ) should establish price caps because it would help other countries establish higher quality medicine and price cap . we have not yet established that price caps are a good thing so you ca n't establish that they are by saying that it will help other countries establish them ( implicitly arguing that a net positive will come from other countries following suit ) . the us healthcare system employs the most cutting edge tactics , innovative procedures , and emerging pharmaceutical solutions . the problem is that we are a ( rather disgustingly ) unhealthy society that is spread out across geography more so than top european nations . the only thing a price cap on pharma would do is cease all further innovation . expensive , emerging medicines cost millions to develope . in their early stages , only rich people can afford them - just like any other innovation . eventually , more production facilities emerge and the medicines become ubiquitous and genricized . two , even if it were n't , drug spending is a very small fraction of overall healthcare spending , and the us is not very different from other countries in this regard , so you 're looking for savings in the wrong place . what on earth do you mean by "" become public information "" , and how on earth does lower prices for drugs generate more development ? it currently costs $ 1b and over 10 years to bring a new drug to the market ( [ -- url -- ) ) currently , it 's vc firms followed by big pharma . if they are n't guaranteed a huge return when they succeed ( for profit , and to offset all the drugs that fail and they get nothing for ) , why should they invest ? people feel the right to a drug that improves their health and saves lives , but that drug did n't exist until a highly expensive high-risk drug program was executed . people are n't funding clinical trials for alzheimer 's drugs ( and they 've all failed ) , but people will certainly feel entitled to the drug if one is to succeed . moreover , passing such a law would invite the question of how prices are set . capping prices could foreseeably dis-incentivize companies to create drugs for diseases with low numbers of patients to spread the cost of development out over . it is a well known fact of basic economics that whenever there is a price cap on a good below the equilibrium price , a shortage occurs due to demand exceeding supply . the way that medicine is developed is through a loss leading cost factor . companies spend millions of dollars up front to create working medicine and working medical devices . if you put a price cap on medication , you kill the market incentive to create new medication . it makes 0 sense to spend millions of dollars and risk losing it all because not enough people will purchase your product . it 's also extremely expensive to start a pharmaceutical company in the first place . so it also kills new potential entries into the market if you place a cap on medication . because the base line assumption is that insurance carriers are paying medical premiums and that is built into the cost of the medication . even someone like the very hated martin shkreli has gone down on public record saying that if you can not afford insurance but need medication his company has developed you can ask , and receive at least some level of treatment completely for free and their pricing structure is designed to hang the insurance companies out to dry . \ > plus , if there was a cap and prices were lowered , it is more likely that important things ( ie . epi pen ) will become public information , allowing them to be more heavily researched , thus allowing for more development of pharma . "" the high level of r&d expenditures in the pharmaceutical industry is easy to understand given the cost of developing a new drug and bringing it to market . the average r&d to marketplace cost for a new medicine is nearly $ 4 billion , and can sometimes exceed $ 10 billion . "" "" it spends more money on medicine and pharma than any other country , and yet still has low quality . "" in terms of some metrics ; the us is n't at the top of the heap . people who have the means vote with their feet and go there . people from outside the country come to the us for treatment . if high prices are the problem , you can either jump right in there and pass a law to restrict prices . instead , the rational way to tackle this problem is to first look at the cause of high prices . we have people coming in trying to reap the benefits of that by slightly going lower in the prices they offer . over time that brings prices down across the board to a level where the incentive to get into the business is significantly lowered because the market is saturated . simple calculators used to be luxury items , but competition allows us now to buy computers more powerful and capable than anything anyone imagined in the 80s and keep them in our pockets . if a company patents their product , nobody can offer the same product for a lower price for the next 20 years . even though everyone knows exactly how the product works and could conceivably produce it for much cheaper and offer it at lower price points , they are legally barred from doing so . the company that owns the patent has no incentive to lower prices because everyone will have to buy from them come hell or high water . the simple thing to do here is to remove the patent laws and allow companies to compete ."

9o794z,"alcohol should be treated by society like tobacco like , why is n't alcohol shunned like tobacco is these days ? and yes , tobacco , not cigarettes . tobacco is the substance , not cigarettes . it 's like saying beer is a substance instead of alcohol . anyway , it 's arguably just as harmful . when someone does n't smoke for health reasons , but yet , is completely fine with drinking alcohol and getting drunk , i do n't get that . if you 're not going to smoke because of its health risks , then you really should n't be drinking either . some of you may argue that drinking in moderation is n't bad , but recent studies ( -- url -- ) suggest differently . in short , both alcohol and tobacco should be shunned by society , not just tobacco , while society glorifies alcohol beyond belief . but what do you think on the matter ? am i right , or am i wrong ? that 's why i 'm posting this here , after all .","i 'm going to focus on smoking , because i think the stigma against other tobacco products is mostly along for the ride . smoking is so dangerous that studies just disagree on exactly how hard it kills you . whereas moderate consumption of alcohol has an effect that is difficult to measure . finally , smoking has a stigma because it affects everyone around . looking at the study , it seems like 1 drink/day ( relative risk all cause mortality : 1.01 ish ) is really only very marginally worse than 0 drinks/day ( rr : 1 ) . i could n't find any data on the relative risk of smoking 1 cigarette/day . overall , being a light smoker ( 1-4 cigarettes/day ) seems to have roughly the health equivalent of drinking 6 drinks/day . so i do n't think it 's accurate to say that alcohol is as bad as tobacco , at least not when both are used lightly . not drinking or smoking is better but smoking is clearly worse . i think the real reason is drinking is fun and cigarette smoke is gross . as a smoker and former heavy drinker , i 'd argue that drinking is looked at as "" worse "" than smoking . sure , a social smoker would likely be looked at as worse than a social drinker , but i would say alcoholics are more condemned than nicotine addicts and that the consumption of alcohol is much more limited . nobody is out here really encouraging heavy drinking aside from other heavy drinkers and somebody downing a whole bottle of tequila doesnt damage my liver the same way that someone smoking a entire pack of cigarettes besides me damages my lungs i do n’t think either should be “ shunned ” - i think we should be honest about the effects and consequences of various drugs , but i do n’t see the point in moralising health . with that in mind , i understand why cigarettes are seen more negatively than alcohol . furthermore there are different long term health consequences associated with different usage along this spectrum . cigarettes do n’t have this quality - any cigarette usage at all is essentially equivalent to some amount of lon term harm . again i do n’t think anybody dserves to be looked down on for their usage but i think this is why cigarettes are seen as more unambiguously “ bad ” or unhealthy relative to alcohol . i ca n't help but think that we see them differently due to our very lengthy history with alcohol compared to tobacco . alcohol has been a major part of human recreation for thousands of years . whereas , tobacco is a plant form the americas hence naver made it to us untill a few hundred years ago . i say us as the native americans have been using tobacco for a very long time but their cultures have not survived so i feel us is incluisvie enough . alcohol is a major part of human culture globally so perhaps we simply ca n't imagine a world without alcohol ."
9o6dhj,"if it 's okay to kill cows , it 's okay to kill dogs this is something that i find infuriating . vegans are constantly told to shut up and not '' tell people what to eat '' , but those same people will then go on to demonize dog eaters . if killing animals is okay , you have to be consistent . it 's like me saying > killing black people is horrible , i do n't care if you kill white people though it just makes no sense to me . unless you can name the morally relevant difference between dogs and cows , i 'll consider it a special pleading . ( this is assuming that you even abide by a moral system , if you do n't then this post is n't for you ) . you ca n't have your cake and eat it too , you know .","i think if you love dogs and keep them as pets , the idea of killing and eating one probably feels very wrong . if it 's ok to kill animals , it 's ok to kill dogs but it 's not ok to kill people 's pet dogs . since we do n't keep cows as pets , it 's still ok to kill all cows . everyone reasonable agrees that killing humans is wrong and killing plants is not wrong . the reason it does n't make sense to you is because you think dogs and cows should be in the same category . besides that , most meat eaters , and maybe even most vegans would kill and eat a dog is their children were starving . i think most people would never kill a human to feed their kids . the utility of a cow is different from the utility of a dog . thus , killing a dog is misuse of its utility , whereas killing a cow is utilizing it . cats used to be treated like vermin , because that 's essentially what they were in cities . as their utility changed to companionship as pets we changed our views of killing them . there is no inherent contradiction in differing views of killing different animals that have different utility to humans . because my problem with yulin is they skin the dogs alive and slowly blowtorch them to death — that they die at the end is the only part i ’m okay with . the idea is to “ flavor ” the meat with pain — the more pain the dog suffers , the more virility will be bestowed upon the eater . i find it morally unjustifiable to break this agreement ( in the absence of a dog that has broken it first ) . my thing is i only feel bad eating smart animals . i feel bad eating pig and octopus , but not cow . but i have no problem with other people eating dog , it just is n't something i 'd ever want to do . i think the moral distinction is dogs are both smart , and loyal . dogs originally being carnivores means you would have to feed a herd of dogs another herd of animals . this is just inefficient and morally worse as you are killing two animals ( if not way more ) rather than one . if we are talking about situations outside agriculture then it would be equally senseless to kill either animal so i would agree with you . what i mean by this is that a dog may provide more subjective happiness to us than a cow will . hence killing the dog would make our lives worse in comparison which lowers overall happiness . obviously there 's the flip side to this and that we do n't know if cows would make us more happy than dogs as we have not really given them the chance to be our pets . then you can add whether the cow would feel more subjective joy than a dog can but i 'd rather not get into an dialog about which animals are more conscious . when we punish someone for hurting or killing an animal , we do n't really see the animals as a legal entity ( they 're property ) , but rather we punish due to the fact that their suffering brings anguish on those that care for them . even in instances where the dogs are without owner , if they 're tortured by people we will still punish those who do . now , whether we sympathize with the animal , ourselves ( because we have our own pets ) or with other owners is left for you to decide and will vary on a person to person basis . killing a dog for its meat does n't make sense , due to the meat being unhealthy to even consume to begin with , and due to them not being bred for this purpose . we overlook killing cattle for their meat , because our bodies crave meat , our bodies are meant to consume meat and award us for doing so . what if these people just do n’t like the idea of people eating dogs , but are ok with others eating cows ? i think technically speaking people can eat whatever they want , however some animals have uses that others do n't . with dogs for example , because of their incredibly sense of smell and ability to be trained to perform lots of different tasks , eating them to me seems like a bit of a waste . especially when you consider animals like chickens and cows have little utility to humans outside of food , it makes sense to eat them instead of dogs . every pet dog i 've had from childhood up we 've had to kill . in that case , killing a dog for food does n't nearly make as much sense as killing a cow for food , on a lot of levels . one , dogs serve a different purpose , and two , dogs are inefficent to produce as food - far more inefficient than cows are . it 's nothing more , but notably nothing less , than a trick some species have evolved , most likely to gain the advantages to living in societies . the reason that some societies shun eating of dogs is that those societies widely view them as loved companions , and , importantly , that means that killing and eating them creates tremendous conflicts between humans in those societies , at whom human morality is primarily targeted . that subjective difference is tremendously important for the function which morality serves : letting people live together harmoniously in societies , and thereby gaining the adaptive advantages that this bestows . i just wanted to point out that dogs and cats have been domesticated to live alongside humans as companions for millennia , while cows have been domesticated ( for a shorter period of time ) to produce and be food . dogs exist for the sole purpose of working for and comforting humans , while cows are a similarly artificial human creation but for the purpose of food . dogs have been bred for companionship , and cows have been bred for dairy and meat for millennia . we intentionally select the traits that connect humans to dogs on an emotional level , and the traits that make cows produce the most ( and/or best ) meat and milk . however , dogs have become part of our society in which we see them as part of our families and as close to humans as an animal can get . cows , on the other hand , are not domesticated in a sense in which they are kept in a house and play , cuddle , and even support us . dogs are able to love humans and show their affection to us whereas cows do not do this to the extent dogs do . morally , the people that kill cows would probably never kill a dog for the reasons i listed above . as horrible as it is , cows are eaten by so many people in the united states whereas the majority of people would not even think of eating a dog . that is a main reason why dogs should not be killed and cows are killed . i just do n't want to , and it 's ridiculous to think i should be forced to just because someone thinks i should be consistent in which animals i kill and eat . i do n't want to kill and eat dogs because they 've been cute and friendly to me and i 've had them as pets . i 've not done so with cows or pigs or chickens . were you to adopt a morally relativistic perspective it would be possible to ascribe moral standards to animals depending on your cultural perspective . the cultural perspective of the west is such that killing and eating dogs is not morally acceptable . by way of contrast , hindus consider it immoral to kill and eat cows . the moral superiority of household pets most likely results from their position in society and their relationship with people . i 'm going to start by saying that i have no problem with killing dogs . no , do n't abuse them , and no , do n't kill them for funsies , but my family had to put one of our dogs down because he was starting to get too aggressive and we simply value our neighbor 's safety more than we value our dog 's life . that said , it 's a practical reason why we eat cows but not dogs : eating carnivorous creatures is much more likely to transmit diseases . oh and also the fact that there 's a much better cost-to-profit ratio of eating cows which only eat grass as opposed to eating something like tigers which eat cows which eat grass -- too many extra steps to eat a carnivore without any real added gain . if we can eat chicken , why not eat a dog or a cat its easier to declare individual species as offlimits and then designate more and more of them rather than demand a blanket ban on all killing right away . the big difference you 're average western civilization has with killing dogs is that they are considered pets moreover than that they are a special class of pets akin to a child in most homes they are treated in spoiled as such . the thought of looking at her and thinking hamburger is so far from reality in my life because i look at her as if she is my child , i care for her like she is my child . i do not have that same sort of child caring benefits towards cats or cows . i think cats are generally evil however i understand that people do and i have been exposed to attitudes towards cats where they are a person 's child . so even though i do n't myself own or even like the thought of having a cat i can understand with and sympathize with that thought . it is common for most people in the western civilized world to at least be able to understand or accept the fact that most cats and dogs and other pets like them are treated like a member of the family , like they were a child . but that is just an illegal sense if you look at how the average person reacts they are considered more than property if my car was set on fire i 'd be a little upset and it 's lost value but if my dog was set on fire i would be devastated . to take that same rationale we 're going to apply it to cows and we 're going to apply it to the western civilization because there are some societies where a cow is sacred and they are placed on a higher level than a child is in the united states . and that particular form a cow here in the united states is property specifically one that was probably put there in the circumstances it was to be used for food , it is similar to a cornfield . from the average person 's perspective there is no difference between chopping down a stalk of corn and killing a cow both result in obtaining food . to summarize ... it depends on the culture and based on the cultural norms dogs are considered more than just a typical pet and therefore the thought of them being equivalent to food in the western cultures is generally unheard of . what line do you draw for what is appropriate to consume and why do you draw it where you do ? i honestly do n’t care it ’s the same with people being angry because horses are killed and again it ’s meat if it tastes good why not do the problem with people being angry for dogs is in some parts of china they believe torturing will make the meat taste people this includes burning them alive skinning them alive hitting them pulling they ’re teeth out cutting they ’re tails and that ’s were the problem lies i and many others will gladly eat meat but the animal should not have to suffer for no reason i seen a few of those videos and they ’re quite gruesome now some chickens do n’t get the best life i have bad stories there too but nothing as bad as what people do to dogs that 'd be like saying we do n't care about killing brown dogs , but not white dogs . we care about dogs because we see them as family . first , all people ( even vegetarians and vegans ) are moral hypocrites . but second , all anyone needs to do to justify their different behavior is name a difference between dogs and cows , and say that the difference is morally important to them . for example , dogs live indoors with humans and cows do n't , and i think that things that live indoors with humans are morally different . or , i have personally known and loved many dogs but no cows , and that difference is important to me . dogs on the other hand have real emotional connections to humans , i 've cried more at the loss of a pet dog than the death of my own grandparents . i 'm seeing a lot of comments and roundabout discussions on why dogs are not equal to cows , but i do n't think that that 's what op is saying . he 's saying that other than our own prejudices , there is fundamentally no difference between a person who is willing to eat dog meat and a person who is willing to eat cow meat . people who eat meat but demonize dog eaters should be rebuked . there are a number of biological reasons why humans evolved to eat prey-animals , like cows , over predators , like dogs . chasing down a fast moving dog or wolf , or even a pack , was less efficient because it was more work for less meat . it ’s much more efficient for industrial agriculture to raise and process cows versus dogs . while today ’s sugar-packed diet touts leaner meat as “ healthier , ” for ancient man calories were king . the predator eats the herbivore can gets those same plant nutrients , albeit reduced , through the herbivore ’s flesh . a predator that eats another predator gets those same nutrients but recycled a third time . the human body gains more plant-based nutrients by eating herbivores than other carnivores . it again comes down to efficiency . so those are my biological reasons for eating cows over dogs . if the choice is starve or eat the dog , i say eat the dog ."
9o5olt,"most of the reddit political subs are leftist echo chambers . i ’d like to preface this by saying i do lean towards the left politically - i ’m admittedly more centre-left than outright left though , and i definitely agree with some of the points often brought up in the mainstream political subs . to be clear , i ’m talking about the major , default subs . almost 1/2 of every article posted to subs such as / r/worldnews , / r/politics , / r/futurology , etc. happen to be prone to what i consider an incredibly biased , leftist overview on things . i ’ve seen comments where people advocated in favour of forming a mob to “ take down ” bankers , or rich people , or some big corporation . the faux-revolutionary internet warrior nature of 90 % of comments on such articles make it hard for me to even take them seriously . furthermore , anybody who has a different opinion to the consensus seems to be downvoted to oblivion frequently - insightful and smart comments seem to not gain much attention , while some dumb aggressive comment gets upvoted to the top . there are conservative echo chambers on reddit as well , such as / r/thedonald ( an absolutely ridiculous sub btw ) , but i ’d argue that most of the default subs are n’t much better in terms of quality .","i would like to point out , that from a european , specifically finnish perspective , the us "" far left "" is still to the right of our local political scene . what we here consider a conversation between the left and right , would likely seem to you a conversation between socialists and communists when viewed from a us perspective . you have to take into account that many redditors are not american/from anglo-saxon countries , and thus do n't have the same political spectrum as americans/many anglo-saxons do . in a country where the right is very conservative , then sure , when you step out of that bubble most people from different places are going to sound more progressive , even if , to their own standards or their country 's strandard , they might not be . that would really give us somewhere to start the discussion . by definition the left seeks change and the right resists change and in the futurology sub you have a collection of people hoping for a change in the world and who have an interest in technology or science . worldpolitics is unmoderated and as a result has a lot of conservatives , and more nazis than i ’d care to hang out with . in fact , note that according to that source , obama and clinton are more extreme in their views than bernie sanders is . sanders is slightly left of center while obama and clinton are strongly right-wing . so when you talk about "" incredibly biased , leftist "" then you 're talking about a scale that is heavily skewed to the right . personally as a fairly left liberal i would much rather talk to an intelligent conservative than a hackish liberal . all i can say is do your best to elevate the conversation , challenge people 's assumptions in tactful thought provoking ways and when you get tired of dealing with the less thoughtful people seek out a more carefully selected community or talk to people irl . as far as echo chambers go , i think that cuts both ways . therefore i would submit that you could also just scroll past the boring circlejerks and find the interesting discussions , and then you might think differently of these subs . hmmmm , i need to know what you mean by "" echo chamber , "" and why you think that affects "" quality "" of a sub ."
9o43ta,"building "" the wall "" is a good idea first off , for those of you living under a rock i am referring to the proposed wall between the us and mexico . secondly , i am not at all a trump supporter , this is one of 3 policies of his that i agree with . anyways , the biggest argument i have heard about not building the wall is that it wo n't stop illegal immigration because most illegal immigrants come in on planes and / or outstay their visas . however the way i see it human trafficking and drug trafficking are some of the biggest issues and those ca n't occur on planes . smuggling drugs on planes is very difficult , especially in large quantities , and you need a passport to go on a plane so human trafficking also can not be done on planes . that leaves driving across the border where , in many spots there really is no border wall of any kind . i think we have all heard horror stories of human trafficking so i wo n't get into that , and drug trafficking would be greatly reduced although not stopped . illegal immigration would also be reduced and it would add more risk to traffickers by making it way more likely to be caught . i understand that this would be very expensive but i think it would be worthwhile . also i wrote this on mobile but i will edit it when i get a chance . / u/shitferbrains55 . i still maintain that we need more border security , but i think that due to ecological and financial reasons a wall does not make sense . i think armed guards and drones would be more effective and efficient . thank you all for the great respons","many of the illegal immigrants in america are people that flew on planes with a visa . i would disagree that building a wall is a good idea based solely on cost . however , i am of securing our border to the south , but not with a physical wall . and with drone technology , it should be easier than ever to patrol our boarder without a huge , expensive , physical wall in place . 95 % of drugs trafficked by cartels into the us come by boat . so many species of animals rely on being able to live on both sides of the border , and stopping that with a 90 feet concrete wall would be horrible for the environment . not that that will deter trump , but i 'm hoping it may convince you of the bad results of the wall . and the theres the cost of not just building , but maintaining the wall would be immense - and trump has decided to permanently cut taxes for the richest , meaning we now have even less money to maintain the wall . finally , i want to add that most every type of border security is made to respond to whatever methods were being used then - and then smugglers adapt and outsmart the security . the wall might temporarily make smuggling harder ( though not impossible , many use tunnels which an above ground wall wo n't do anything about ) , but in the end the smugglers will find ways around it . the wall is a waste of time and money , will be disastrous for the environment , and have little long term impact on drug smuggling . that 's the length of the u.s.-mexico border , so that 's how long the wall has to be . the wall has to be at least 30 feet tall , and at least 10 more feet underground , to prevent easily going over it or tunneling under it . you need to dig a trench that gives you room to work , so it 'll be 10 feet by four feet by 1,954 miles . your wall needs ports along the bottom to let water through and prevent flooding , especially along the rio grande . you have to design these with grates that are unbreakable and wo n't let people pass drugs through , but these grates also have to be easily replaceable because things break down over time , so you ca n't just build them into the structure of the wall . if you put guards on top of the wall , it needs to be at least two feet thick with guardrails so they can safely walk on it . so now you need to engineer the wall with entry points every mile or so . you also need to budget not just construction , but several thousand guards + equipment forever . you do not prevent concrete from cracking , you only delay it . there are thousands of weak points in your wall now , and that earthquake five years ago caused a few hundred feet to crack and lean , nearly toppling . that entire section needs to be cut out and replaced . a thousand miles away from that , a five-mile section near the rio grande is starting to sink . i would love to take a shot at changing your view , because the idea of a border wall is one of those policies that sounds good on paper , but works super badly in practice . while this is fairly accurate for drug smuggling , since it just is n't economical ( as other have mentioned 95 % + of narcotics enter by boat ) , human trafficking can and does happen via plane . according to some industry specialists , somewhere between 600,000-800,000 people are trafficked by air every year , and currently flight crews are seriously under-trained on how to recognize signs of trafficking on their flights . this admittedly is n't currently the primary mode of illegal entry into the us for mexican migrants , but it might become a more heavily utilized route if other options were constricted . its also worth remembering that about 45 % of migrants who remain in the us illegally originally come in on a legal temporary visa , so its fully possible this route would become more desirable if a border wall was constructed . most of the places that do n't have a wall are areas where the natural terrain makes crossing extremely difficult . instead people just took more risk trying to get into the us through these dangerous stretches of desert and mountains , because ultimately economic pressures still put a huge incentive on illegal migration . as a result , over 10,000 people have died trying to cross the us-mexican border since 1994 , and the count may be far higher as many bodies are never found in these desolate areas . if we build a wall people will still try to migrate so long as economic pressures make it viable to do so , we just increase the chances that people will be harmed or die in the process by adding more difficulty . where trafficking is concerned , this industry exists along the us-mexican border because tighter security has made it necessary for migrants to hire specialists in order to successfully make the trip . when entering the us was as simple as swimming across the rio grande , specialized knowledge was n't needed , and thus neither human trafficking nor the organized crime it brought with it was as prevalent . by building a wall , we only increase the difficulty of making a crossing , thus making the expert knowledge of a trafficker all the more important for potential migrants . while some trafficers may leave the business due to increased risk following a wall , others might respond by becoming even more aggressive towards the migrants they traffic or border authorities , in order to ensure their business remains profitable . essentially , while there 's a small chance that a border wall could make the trafficking situation better , i would argue that there 's a much stronger possibility it would make the situation way worse . for the reasons i 've listed , i do n't think the wall would help with out current illegal immigration situation . simply put it would making crossing more dangerous , possibly make trafficking an ever bigger problem , and would likely simply push people into trying other modes of migration . with that in mind , i want to look to our past , as i think it provides us with a good step for dealing with migration moving forwards . weirdly , the evidence seems to indicate that the best way to deal with illegal migration might actually be less security and restrictions on legal entry . essentially , when border security was low , there were regular waves of migrants who would come over the border illegally in search of seasonal work . however , as we tightened border security it made crossing much more expensive , and as a result it become more and more economically difficult for migrants to return home . while security limited border crossings somewhat , it made it massively more likely that illegal migrants would stay in the us once they arrived , thus creating the large population of undocumented people that we have here today . oddly enough , in an effort to slow illegal migration , policy makers actually created an even bigger problem . fortunately though , we can reverse this trend and build upon the more positive patterns that existed before security was massively tightened . if we give aspiring migrants legitimate opportunities for short-term work visas , which do n't currently exist , we increase the chances that these folks will return home once their work is complete , since they 'll know they can come back later without substantial cost/risk . frankly , this would be an optimal solution , as labor from these migrants is actually badly needed in the agricultural and construction industry , which is part of what is currently driving illegal migration . by simply reforming our immigration law we could reduce illegal entry into the country , reduce the risk of death/harm to migrants , and reduce the need for traffickers , thus putting many of these criminals out of business . this solution is good for our economy , humanitarian , and way cheaper than building a huge wall . i am not here to solely convince you it is a bad idea though , but to ask you if military partnership to seek and destroy drug cartels and trafficking rings would be a better solution to you . the problem is a small group and an extremely poor immigration policy . it seems like your argument boils down to : while not effective w/r/t illegal immigration ( because most people come in ways that would n't be obstructed by a wall ) a wall would nonetheless be effective at stemming illegal drugs and trafficked humans . so first , do you have any reason to believe that drugs and trafficked humans come into our country predominantly through places that would be obstructed by a wall . second , have you spent much time researching the impacts of attempts to fight drug importation in the us over the last 50 years or so ? because there is a strong profit motivating moving the drugs , and because any success in stemming their entry raises the price of drugs , thus increasing the profit motivation , every attempt to stops drugs coming in has just been overcome from some equivalent innovation , ruthlessness , or willingness to get busted more often from the other side . increase border patrol so more cars get stopped and searched ? they 'll just send more product over and eat the losses , since prices have increased and profit is higher for drugs that get through . if you assume that the government should restrict drug trafficking , this would be a bad way of doing it . all this ( as well as other border security measures , like drones ) will do is , increase prices for drugs a little because it will take a little more effort and maybe risk to smuggle them through . this will incentivize more people to join the drug trafficking because now the rewards have gone up . the result will be an escalation of drug trafficking and more creative solutions of bypassing the various barriers ."
9o3vik,"the united states of america should conduct a trade war against china a "" trade war "" is a scenario in which the united states would carrier tariffs and other trade barriers against chinese goods and companies coming into the united states . i believe : 1 . it is the duty of the us government to carry out a trade war . 2 . it is the global interest for the us to conduct this trade war and encourage other countries to do the same . 3 . regardless of whether this is in the interests of the us economy , and there is a very big chance that it is , this is comparatively less important than the first two points . & #x200b ; the us and china have one of the largest trade relationships in the world . china 's economy largely relies on trade , much of which goes to the us ( in 2015 this amounted to over $ 500 billion ) . china also manages to maintain very high levels of economic growth , and much of that growth relies on american trade . we would accept this growth if it were on fair terms , but china is not fair and it does not play by the rules . these are all examples of unfair trade practices china uses to ensure it unfairly benefits from other countries : 1 . agressive devaluation of the yuan and fixed exchange rates . 2 . theft of intellectual property from american companies as american companies who want to do business in china must partner with a chinese company . in the past this has resulted in many cases of american intellectual property such as patents and designs being taken illegally . the office of the united states trade representative has published an extensive report about such practices , effectively amounting to corporate espionage . 3 . export tax rebates and other subsidies which make it extremely difficult for companies abroad to compete with chinese companies . 4 . the fact that chinese companies looking to expand into the us face few barriers as opposed to the other way round . an example of this was the law that american companies must partner with chinese ones when looking to expand into that market . 1 . it is the duty of the us government to carry out a trade war . the us government has a duty to protect its economy from aggression and its companies from unfairness abroad by other countries . what this means is that it should take an interest in ensuring that enterprises by its own citizens are on a level playing field when it comes to dealing with other countries . therefore when the intellectual property of us citizens are being stolen by foreign powers , when us companies can not compete because china is aggressively subsidising their own exporters , when chinese policies mean that the trade relationship is unfair , the us government should retaliate against these policies to try and achieve that protection . a trade war will do this for two reasons : 1 . to create a precedent - there are other rapidly growing economies around the world that are developing trade relationships with the us . this will send a message that the us will retaliate against other attempts to manipulate the us for economic growth and therefore this will happen less . this is good because us companies are more likely to expand into other countries , develop intellectual property to be distributed for consumers and provide employment for people in those countries . 2 . this policy is likely to be effective - given that tariffs will hit china 's economy hard , not only is the government incentivised to make some concessions because the chinese government is focused on maintaining high levels of economic growth , but also because the manufacturing industry which employs massive amounts of chinese citizens will be affected . as one of the main reasons why the chinese people have tolerated autocracy is because of the jobs and prosperity the manufacturing industry and trade has brought , these measures will increase discontent for the government , empowering groups that seek to achieve change . 2 . it is in the global interest for the us to conduct this trade war and encourage others to do the same . at the moment china is on tract to surpass the us as the global hegemon . it is doing this through three ways : 1 . increasing the size of its military - purchasing new aircraft carriers , developing new missiles and in general developing its military strength . 2 . economic investment in other countries abroad , such as the funding of infrastructure in african nations . 3 . territorial expansion - the main example of this is the 9-dash line in the south china sea , an unfair intrusion into the waters of other sovereign nations such as vietnam . this is bad for 3 reasons : 1 . china tends to diplomatically and economically support autocracies and dictatorships , because liberal democracies tend to lean to similar states in the west . examples of these are some of china 's greatest friends - russia , north korea , syria and iran . supporting these states through investment and trade which in some cases violates internationally agreed sanctions is a bad thing , and if china gains more power those nations feel more empowered to commit aggressions knowing who they have on their side . 2 . when entire continents such as africa fall into the geopolitical sphere of influence of china because of economic investment in exchange for political control , ' debt traps ' where china funds projects that they know will fail and the expansion of chinese companies into those countries , this is bad because in the long term those countries will drift farther away from western liberal democracies and are therefore less likely to comply with international bodies such as the united nations on issues such as sanctions , less likely to actively try and become more democratic and less corrupt , and finally more likely to focus on rapidly achieving economic growth for the benefit of chinese companies whilst the interests of the environment of the people of those countries , who usually would have very little political power compared to these tncs , are ignored . 3 . the sovereignty of other nations is violated . as of now the us and the international community largely co-operate when it comes to international maritime border issues related to china . we believe that their judgement is vastly superior to china 's when it comes to whose borders should be where especially considering 1 . most countries are impartial and 2 . it is in the interest of china to aggressively expand its control in the south china sea to secure oil resources , international shipping routes and military installations . the reason why china has suddenly become more able to fund its military and invest in other countries , as well as why it has become more confident diplomatically , is because it has been achieving high levels of economic growth . a trade war will impede that growth and overall ensure that the us will retain power over china for longer into the future . 3 . it is in the long-term economic interests of the us to carry out this trade war . we accept that tariffs may increase prices for consumers at home , but we are willing to accept this if it means that in the long term future where china is likely to make at least some concessions and where the us responds with a similar lowering of tariffs . as they say , "" short term pain , long term gain . "" we vastly prefer a future in which the chinese economy is more open to us companies with us consumers affected for a relatively short period of time as opposed to one where little is done and the us and other countries continue to be locked in unfair trade relationships where one side benefits and the expense of the other . there is a massive trade imbalance between the us and china at $ 375 billion in 2017 . china benefits a lot more from trade with the us than the other way around , and they will be hit harder as a result of a trade war . this will result in a market the us companies can more easily expand into , benefiting those companies , their employees and the us economy . & #x200b ; say that china digs in its heels and does not make any concessions for a protracted period of time . we still believe that because of the precedent that is set by these actions , as well as the fact that china 's power becomes more limited , thus resulting in better lives for people living in what would be china 's sphere of influence around the world , that a trade war is still a good thing . & #x200b ;","a lot . if this is a reason for a trade war against china , it 's also a reason for a trade war against the u.s. intellectual property theft is something i 'm not knowledgeable enough to comment on . the other things you talk about could be better described as the chinese government hurting some of its citizens in an attempt to help a small group of them . this allows americans to benefit from products that are cheaper than would otherwise be possible . you find this so offensive that you think we should support harming americans in order to offset this . if china wishes to harm most of its citizens and its economy , we should allow them to do so . but what if the current trade war is designed to increase trade via lower total tariffs at the end of the “ war ” ? going to try to answer a few of these off the top of my head . that is a bit disingenuous and many countries engage in this behavior - including the u.s . the last time the gop attempted to frame china as targeting u.s. business through devaluation of the yuan , it turned out that the chinese government was actually working on raising the value of the yuan ( literally the exact opposite of what people thought ) . all things considered however , yuan : usd ratio is relatively steady and while exchange rates influence trade , i do n't believe this is a genuine concern at this point . there are already mechanisms in place to target industries where subsidies and dumping are being used to negatively impact u.s. business . anti dumping duties/countervailing duties ( add/cvd ) have long been used to target companies in foreign countries that sell products in the u.s. below their local market price ( add ) or receive subsidies from their own government ( cvd ) . this includes industries/products such as steel , lumber , candles , christmas bows , etc . operating within these frameworks addresses the problem and helps ensure u.s. businesses are not blind sided by randomly applied tariffs . trade balances do n't really matter , especially with a single given country . in many cases , a trade deficit is ideal for the united states as it helps preserve the dollar 's status as a reserve currency and artificially lowers the cost of maintaining our debt as this excess income in usd is used to buy treasury bonds . even besides this however , i would argue that while china may have a positive trade balance , the flip side is the money saved by u.s. consumers combined with china incurring the long term costs of environmental damage from the type of manufacturing outsourced ( especially anything to do with rare earth metals ) is worth the deficit than the alternative of bearing that environmental cost . finally , partially as an aside : part of the issue with this trade war with china is the general uncertainty surrounding it . some of the tariffs ( list 3 in particular of the 301 tariffs ) were applied within a week of the list being made public and proper instructions for disclaiming the additional duty on entry sheets was not disclosed until the friday before they were applied . this means that product currently shipping ( as in , containers on the water ) would enter with an additional 10 % duty that was not even announced when the goods shipped . if the us wanted to better discourage trade with china while not hurting american consumers , they would provide greater time between announcing the tariffs and implementing them so that companies could look to alternative ( domestic manufacturing or chinese rivals in the philippines , vietnam , cambodia , etc ) . it would also be nice if the government attempted to negotiate in good faith before heading down the road to tariffs as well . in re : your last point , that this is in the long-term interests of the us . the issue with this is that it neglects the upside of the trade deficit -- the flow of capital back into the us . when we buy lots of goods from china , those chinese factories end up with a lot of us dollars . factory owners end up exchanging usd for renminbi , which leaves the chinese central bank with lots of usd it needs to do something with . by and large , what they do is invest in us bonds , mortgages , etc. . . this in turn finances americans ' ability to buy on credit , to take out a mortgage , and the us government 's ability to finance whatever projects or spending it wants . if we start a trade war with china , this easy credit begins to dry up . this could really badly hurt the american economy and the global economy ."
9o3619,"israel and palestine should try to come to a different type of one state solution in the issue there are people who support a one state solution and a two state solution ( these are at least as the most common types of solution people support ) . the two state solution says that both israel and palestine should get their own state . the one state solution is often presented as it all either becoming one big israel or one big palestine . & #x200b ; i believe there is another option that is seldom discussed . i am against nationalism in all forms , and so much misery has been caused by both sides claiming they are truly indigenous to the land and they other has less right to it . i think that israel never should have been created , although it is True a state named palestine never existed , because there were already people living there when israel declared independence and they did not consent to be governed by israel . it would be xenophobic not to let jews migrate there , but the issue was n't their presence it was the creation of an ethno-state . & #x200b ; in response , some palestinians believe the land is theirs and theirs only and jews should not have the right to live there , essentially wanting to create their own ethno-state . many jews have only ever called israel there home and it would be inhumane to expect them to pack up and leave everything they know regardless if it was moral to create israel originally or not , so a state that is neither a jewish nor palestinian state should be created where each groups have equal rights protected by a constitution , so whatever group is in the majority ca n't vote away the minorities rights . essentially i am arguing against the concept in a state particularly aimed to be the rightful land of one religion or ethnic group as israel claims to be a jewish state and many palestinians advocate for a state that would favor palestinians over jews .","moreover , the country 's laws are determined by its government - if either group gets a sufficient majority , they can just cancel this arrangement and start oppressing the other group outright . currently in total ( israel and the palestinian territories ) , there are \ ~ 6.5 million jewish citizens and \ ~ 6 million muslim palestinians . any single state would have to include all of those people as citizens . given existing birth rates , palestinians would outnumber jews within a few decades . so , any state designed to keep a balance would have to formalize the status of palestinians as second class citizens with reduced voting rights . additionally israeli 's would never agree to it because it would mean sacrificing the status of israel as a "" jewish state . "" this is why the problem persists , because israel is essentially trapped by demographics . their current situation ( maintaining the statelessness of the palestinians ) is preferable to either of the alternatives as a two-state solution would require them to renounce territory ( including part of jerusalem ) and a one-state solution would condemn them to long-term decline . for something to change , the current situation has to somehow become untenable . but until something like that happens , israel has no real motivation to alter the status quo . problem is that both jews and palestinians are native to the land , have history there , etc. so do some smaller groups like druze and samaritans . so while one country for all of them makes sense , the religious leaders ( hamas and the knesset ) wo n’t allow it i have a strong sense of nationalism and i 'm all for foreign national policy that promotes the usa 's interests aka my interests . we need strong allies in the region and israel is that song ally . palestine is a likely enemy in the region and i would like to see them have no power and be forgotten . good foreign policy should be made by people with a cold heart and a strong stomach ."
9o22l4,"voting should not be mandatory . choosing not to vote is a perfectly valid form of participating in a democracy voting is mandatory in my little european nation . well , showing up is , anyway . you can hand in a blank ballot or write some anarchist message on the paper with your pathetic little red crayon , but you 're legally required to show up . imo in a True democracy everyone should be able to choose whether they want to vote or not . not showing up to the polling station at all is also a form of participation , because you 're still choosing not to vote for anyone . making voting mandatory encourages people who have not done any research and do n't care about politics in any way to just check one of the boxes to get it over with . --- i 'm not sure why you lot seem to think i 'm talking about american politics when i specifically mentioned in the post that i live in europe . i 'm talking about democracies as a whole . ---","i agree that you should n't be forced to vote for one party or another , but i think that if you do n't want to vote for any of the existing parties , you should cast a blank vote . i think this because we as a society would then know that you care about the election , but just do n't agree with the parties . if you do n't vote at all it seems like you just do n't care about who runs the country . if u want to look at a real True democracy look at ancient rome . just saying a real True democracy does n't exist today as far as i 'm concerned . if polling suggests that certain demographic groups are more likely to vote for your rival then you can close polling stations that those groups would use and many of the people who would more likely vote for the rival will just go home instead of waiting in line for hours . voting is how you voice your opinion on tax collection and spending . i 'm from australia , where voting is mandatory , and i think it 's an important part of our democracy . it prevents small but well mobilised groups from having a disproportionate impact on voting results . you can choose whether you want to vote or not . leave it blank , paint a dog , your options are limited only by the tiny red crayon . more importantly , non-mandatory voting means that politicians can win elections not just by convincing voters , but also by frustrating voters into not voting . closing voting stations in those areas causes long queues , thus causing people to not bother . i agree with your first point ; however , choosing not to vote would only be a valid form of participation if there was a result that favored it . not voting would be a valid form of participation if the result of this election were no outcome . neither party wins , and a new election cycle begins until either party retains a majority of votes . instead , it is intentionally not participating in democracy - regardless of the motivation behind it . if you want to give not voting a power , then you must change your government accordingly . in order to achieve that , you must vote until your choice to abstain can effect direct change . furthermore , to prevent the political manipulation by encouraging non-voting , a certain percentage of qualified voters should be required before any government could form . not enough people show up to vote , too bad politicians , guess you have to try again . at very least , then they have to give you a reason to vote rather than simply playing the , "" i 'm the least evil "" game . i have a problem with people who do n't vote but always have something negative to say about politics . as someone else pointed out , you do n't actually have to give a vote , just turn up . though i would agree , that this also slightly defeats the point of a True democracy . however , i do n't think that a ' classical ' democracy is either realistic nor desirable . it 's why so many so-called ' democracies ' are in fact republics . mandatory voting helps prevent small , passionate minorities from hijacking the political direction of the country . while i 'm sympathetic to the idea that we should n't be forced to show up and vote by the government - i think removing the danger that non-mandatory voting brings is worth it , and it 's a fairly minor imposition for the sake of protecting the integrity of the system . for your information there are barely democratic countries in the world for instance calling it america a democracy just makes you look stupid because america is a republic i 'd say choosing not to vote is the opposite of participating , but i would also defend your right to make that choice . i am not involved in local politics and know nothing about any candidates in my state . i can not make an informed decision and i feel it is reckless to blindly vote for people because they have a d or r next to their name . imo you ’re being extremely ungrateful that you even can vote , it ’s a right that people have given their lives for . tldr : despite perception , there is no negative consequences of mandatory voting to democracy and only a negligible amount to personal liberties . in spite of this the pros are still more than beneficial enough than any perceived cons to justify mandatory voting . imo there is no effective difference between not voting vs scratching your ballot in terms of someone that does not prefer any available option apart from not showing up being an objective form of not participating both technically and practically so i see this as essentially the right to be unfortunately lazy . i do n't see any principles in democracy backing an individual 's choice to remain lazy . instead i can only see an argument for personal liberties applying to this , and to that i say it 's as important fundamentally an exception to personal liberties as mandatory vaccination as it imposes no harm to anyone nor any real inconvenience while being permeant to the greater good of society . if someone chooses to scratch their ballot that is a real form of participation very much unlike not showing up and when you have significant portions of the population doing this it actually carries weight because they demonstrate active disapproval in the parties rather than passive . when people do n't show up it mostly consists of laziness and a lack of excitement that otherwise would vote , the third and smallest group are those that do not wish to support a candidate and their voices can only benefit from an active scratch vote . there is no benefit of not voting to them beyond the minuscule amount of time they save which should very much be supplemented by competent voting process and mail in votes . in fact those things would improve greatly improve if everyone had to vote , the only reason the processes can be so bad in some places eg the states , is specifically to suppress those votes which would not take place if they had to make it work . as for the benefit of mandatory voting which you are negating to focus on the fundamental merit of it ( fairly so ) , there are massive snowballing effects to the health of a democracy . most bad things done in politics are executed by the power of few to influence many , it 's usually the evil party that has a smaller supporting group and yet they do well so often because they utilize their greater resources invested by those that stand to gain from their evil , and a minority group with higher utilization often beats out the majority with less . this is a vast oversimplification but it applies to any democracy from the minority nazi party to the minority evil and more-corrupt-than-other-guys us republican party , and everything in between . mandatory voting does n't ensure the best outcome because people are imperfect but it does a massive amount to curb the worst outcome with less input resources than any other factor ( eg . there should be an option that is ' no candidate is acceptable ' if this option wins , the election should be re-run , with all the previous candidates banned from standing . though i recognize how even the notion of compelling people to vote can seem authoritarian , the more people who vote the better the system will be . i like the idea of a political system that builds in a protest vote -- a blank vote like they have in france where you can vote against all of the candidates . even better would be a rule that if there are enough such blank votes , elections must start over with new candidates . i grew up with mandatory voting then moved to places without it . many because if they had to spend half a day voting then they might as well know what the choices were about . i did n’t need to go to one place only , i could choose from a dozen or so locations or even do an absent vote in any other polling place . in ireland on the other hand you registered in one location and had to go there to vote . most students registered at their parents place in the country and then found it difficult to travel there to vote on the thursday voting day . in my opinion this grossly disenfranchised those people most likely to be adversely affected by the results . for these reasons i believe that voting should be mandatory . if you dobt like any candidate choose the no candidate vote . what happens if you do n't vote is you are a thoughtful person and you can wisely select candidate but if you do n't then the persuaded people only will vote so whats the point i do agree that the choice of participation is participating in a democracy . it is a slippery slope when the government starts interfering in the lives of their citizens by making things mandatory . voting should not be “ mandatory ” but should be highly incentivized . it is a fine line between two statements : a democracy requires the input of all the people and a democracy gives the people the right to choose even if that means not participating . democracy requires participation or you open the door to corruption on mass levels . i also do n't see what voting has to do with a "" True democracy "" as a democracy is government system allowing citizens to participate in the government , and thus a "" True democracy "" would see high levels of participation to fit the definition , otherwise it 's just a republic . i 'm not sure what options are on electronic voting stations . so , in other words , american democracy working as intended : to thwart rebelliousness and preserve order . if one set fails to solve the problems they wait patiently a few years and vote in another set . despite decades of evidence to prove the contrary , they continue to believe that this is the solution to their problems . a dictator should not abstain from making a decision because they feel as if they are uninformed because they have been placed into that office with those responsibilities . pragmatically speaking , a dictator making uninformed decisions is terrible , as is a voter making uninformed choices - but i think the better argument is not to resign to pragmatism , but discuss ideals . part of the political freedom that comes with being able to vote means that you have to inform yourself to some extent . is pointless making people show up when they do n’t want to vote for any of the animals . if enough people vote this option , they can make not liking any of the existing options a more valuable position without inducing voter apathy . also employers will have to let people go and vote and more people will complain if there are no voting booths close to them if it is forced i 'm sorry but a democracy only functions if the population votes . if you can draw a puppy , that means voting is already not mandatory . and i think this should be mandatory , because if you do n't , it 's much easier to steal votes . if you have a growing demographic that feels the system doesnt work and chooses not to participate , they hand the election to people who are not suitable to run the country and ruin the system even more causing less participation . eventually the system changes to the point it can not be changed without revolution and possibly violence . i do n't disagree with the principles at work here , but in practice , mandatory voting does n't always turn out so well . it 's also ruined some democracies -- compulsory voting has resulted in certain populaces voting in con-men , celebrities , and ideologues due to ignorance and/or apathy ( look at brazil ) . anyway , my point is , i think the best thing to do would be to ensure that anyone who wants to vote and feels confident in their vote , can cast it . when voting is n't mandatory , you ca n't distinguish between an individual who chooses silence and an individual who is silenced . mandatory voting makes it harder for a government to rig elections . for example , in smaller countries , conscription or draft makes sense , but not in bigger countries . maybe not voting in a smaller country makes a more significant change than in a bigger country . in india , the world 's largest democracy , we have an option called "" nota "" i : e "" none of the above "" . you can choose not to vote or vote as "" nota "" if you think none of the parties/candidates seem worthy enough of your vote . most comments here refer to oddly specific us problems like voter suppression , voter registration , voting on workdays , etc . for all other modern democracies , which is what you seem to refer to , it is a matter of choice architecture . if you make voting the default option , most people will vote once they are at the poll . only a tiny fraction of very insightful voters will acknowledge their own ignorance and vote blank . most will choose an option even if they do n't care/don ' t understand the implications . however , it is also a way of giving cohesion in societies with educational or cultural challenges , where big sectors of population may never even think of politics unless you force them to vote . on the other hand , requiring a minimum effort to vote ensures a minimum motivation behind each vote . still many people may vote frivolously , but you make sure candidates do n't target specifically people who cant be bothered to think of politics . in western european countries such as ours , i think the best balance is to make voting easy but not mandatory ( this solves mostly what the us comments here were arguing ) . however , think of new democracies or countries with extreme inequality . in those cases , it may be a good idea to establish a default of voting until democratic culture and education catch up . one negative effect of voluntary voting is that candidates campaign with the goal of motivating their base over wooing moderates . we see this in the usa , where voter turnout is a huge determinant of election results - for instance , democrats tend to do worse during midterms and local elections because young people vote less than old people . if everyone has to show up and cast some sort of ballot ( even a blank one ) , then riling up the base becomes less important and presumably candidates will adopt stances to attract the largest number of voters . because technically speaking , in belgium , voting is not mandatory , going to vote is . since voting is mandatory in your european country , i guess that you 're either from luxembourg or from belgium , who are both having elections today . keep in mind why it is exactly luxembourg and belgium that still have compulsory suffrage : luxembourg only has a population of 582,000 inhabitants , but only 50 % of them have the luxembourgish citizenship - that makes only 286,000 people eligible to vote . with a number as small as that , compulsory suffrage becomes inevitable in order to represent the democratic will . ( note that luxembourg has also already debated about giving people living in luxembourg but not having the citizenship the right to vote in order to reinforce their democracy ! ) when it comes to belgium , the compulsory voting exists in order to represent the three different communities ( dutch , french and german ) plus brussels , who lies in the dutch-speaking part but is mainly french-speaking . so when you think about the benefits and drawbacks of compulsory voting , keep in mind that the countries that still have it might differ in their population from other countries who do not have compulsory voting anymore . as a fervent believer in non-voting , i see non-votes as not just part of the election process , but a critical one . this is because every vote represents a threshold for trust and alignment between candidate and voter . now if i were to play devil 's advocate against my belief , it would be to argue that if we made voting mandatory , this non-voting mass could be formally captured if they put their abstention in the ballot . what about a voting quorum where a certain percentage of the population must vote for the winner to be considered the valid "" majority "" choice ? in the event of a failed quorum you could trigger a runoff election or two with only the candidates earning at least a certain percentage of the votes and ultimately trigger a redo election with new candidates if the current set continues to fail to inspire a quorum . encourage voting without making it mandatory , it 's in the politicians interest to encourage voters and facilitate the process . additionally the protest vote would have power in that the population does not have to choose the lesser of two ( or more ) evils and can reject the candidates outright thus encouraging campaigns to cater to wider constituencies . if you want to take advantage of government services and/or receive tax deductions , you should be required to vote . as it currently stands , the goal in american politics at least is not about changing minds or winning policy arguments - it 's about angering your base so they show up while discouraging or disenfranchising the other party . because a vote not cast is a vote they do n't have to try and win , they actively reduce the electorate to the people that enthusiastically agree with them , contributing to the polarization of the political landscape . i 've long thought that the american voting system should require not just a majority of votes cast , but rather a majority of eligible voters voting in favor , we 'd have a better system . this would be the same as having an option on every ballot that says "" no "" . if the "" no "" vote wins , both candidates are ineligible , and the process restarts . if you do n't like either party ( or at least the hacks they 've nominated ) , you can actively vote "" no , try again "" . if , however , every ballot not cast is an automatic no , then staying home legitimately hurts the candidates . they will need people to go to the polls to have a valid election result . they will need to win votes from everyone they can , because they can vote no or stay home . it would reduce the "" lesser of two evils "" effect and empower third party candidates . unfortunately , most democracies do n't consider a vote not cast in the totals . in order to try and solve the same problem , they made voting mandatory . staying home just means they do n't have to work to win your vote . letting people stay home encourage them to try to get people to stay home and empowers them to actively disenfranchise anyone that does n't blindly support them . so while i think making voting optional could still allow people to be actively participating in democracy by not voting , i do n't believe there are many countries where that would be better . voting should n’t be mandatory but it should be mandatory that employers make it so people can go out and vote it 's not democratic , but many countries pick and choose those parts of democracy that they want . also not very happy that i had to go all the way to limburg today just to vote whereas i actually live in brussels ( have n't changed my domicile yet ) . however , i am actually grateful for the fact that i , as a woman , have the right to vote . how many young people would perhaps want to go , but their parents would not allow them , spouses preventing their partner to vote , etc . also , the current young generations are ' lazy ' ( by lack of a better term , as they are not lacking interest in any way ) , so if they do n't have to vote there 's a big chance that they wo n't . take a look at trump , where a lot of people supporting hillary never bothered to vote , and brexit , where most younger generations thought the idea was crazy enough that it would never get through , and thus they did n't vote . less extreme political parties , or parties currently in power , will have a much harder time convincing people to vote if it 's not mandatory . if voting were mandatory and you could turn in a blank sheet at least we 'd know everyone had the chance to vote . compulsory voting ensures that workers ca n’t be browbeaten ( or worse ) into staying at work because it suits their bosses ’ business needs . that would have the implicit effect of excluding the poor from voting even further . compulsory voting is without a doubt annoying , but it ’s part of one ’s civic duty ( just like how jury duty , parking within only one parking space , paying taxes ) is a civic duty . it ’s a minor annoyance that has huge effects on participation rate and it means that , since people are forced to turn up , a non-vote ( not marking any thing on the ballot ) is recorded as a rejection of the candidates , rather than as laziness or whatever else . it makes voting fairer and gets us closer to achieving the goal of voting you need to be able to vote in order to choose not to vote . many people in the us are not even able to vote because it is not mandatory ( people who are incarcerated , votes that are suppressed by corrupt politicians , etc. ) your assumption that the people who do n’t vote in non-mandatory elections are exercising their democratic right not to vote is not always True . in my european country , voting is n’t mandatory , and i strongly believe it should be for multiple reasons . in my country , more than 50 % of our people ( who can vote ofc ) are skipping the elections . however , i strongly believe that voting is our duty as a citizen . if you do n’t go to vote , you ’re refusing to take part in democracy and refusing a fundamental right of our system . also i tend to say that if you did n’t go to vote , you should n’t have any rights to complain about the future politics of the country you ’re in . if all the people that did n’t vote during our last presidential election had gone voting , the results would have been drastically different . also , i think white votes should be taken entirely as a real vote . if the majority of people vote white , the government should reorganize an election with different candidates , until someone ’s is elected . anyway , thanks for raising that subject that was quite interesting to read everyone ’s opinion the matter . it ensures that people are taking part in the diplomatic process a simple solution would be to opt to abstain on the ballot , this would ensure that people are not being prevented from voting due to circumstances mentioned in other comments and preventing people not voting simply due to laziness it makes sure that the diplomatic process is properly adhered to the only "" True democracy "" was practiced by the ancient greeks in which voting was mandatory and one could be legally reprimanded for not showing up to a vote they were required to participate in . there were even squads that would round up and literally and drag people to whatever location voting happened and force them to vote . what you want is not a True democracy but rather more of a constitutional republic someone else made this same point - all mandatory voting does is ensure that efforts to suppress voting fail and guarantee that anyone who wants to vote , does vote . anyone who does n’t want to vote can just drop their blank ballot in the box and go their merry way . why would they be encouraged to check off a random box rather than to just give a blank ballot which is already allowed ? voting should be mandatory but with a "" vote for noone "" option . not voting is not participating in the vitality of creating a thriving community that uses votes to gauge what is needed . technically you 're forced to vote , in reality nobody 's got any legal pursuit since 2003 , i for one did n't bother showing up . if you choose not to decide , you still have made a choice . well , i 'm not really addressing the spirit of your question ... but a point of order : a True democracy is one were laws are passed by a majority of citizens . if voting in brexit were compulsory , the uk would not be leaving the eu . if it were compulsory in the states , trump would almost definitely not be in power . making attendance compulsory also removes issues faced in many countries where roadblocks to participating in "" democracy "" occur all the time with voter registration issues , excessive lines at voting booths etc . when the entire populace is forced to attend at the very least , you end up with a system that is ready for every citizen in the country to walk through and vote . compare that to countries where people wait several hours and have their registrations canceled or delayed and tell me that you think democracy works best when you are n't forced to attend the vote . i think some people made some good points and you have given them a delta . i do n't think people should be required to fight for their country but i think you should be require to do things like show up to vote , make a responsible attempt to report a violent crime , jury duty , etc. . when voting is mandatory , structures will arise to support voting ."
9o1bbs,"white-collar crime is the most heinous crime that exists -- and as such -- deserves 25tolife or capital punishment . this is sort of a 2 part cmv . 1 . white collar-crime is the most heinous crime . white collar criminals have the most capacity for harm . their crimes have the potential to destabalize entire countries ( millions harmed ) -- wheras murderers and rapists can only destabalize communities , families , and especially individuals . ( hundreds harmed ) most harm in the world i see is sourced from corperations & corrupt politicians . the big 3 being : the decay of governments as institutions and the social orders they protect -- the destruction of nature and total explotation of all resources -- the massive human rights violations by using people as resources in sweatshops and unsafe factories . 2 . as such -- deserves 25tolife or capital punishment . i think the majority of people believe that serial murderers and rapists deserve the maximum possible sentance . ( 25tolife or death ) this is due to the extreme amount of harm they cause , and to prevent that harm from happening again . i beleive the extreme punishments fits the extreme crimes . and furthermore deters would-be murderers -- as they fear punishments . so it stands to reason those capable of doing even more extreme harm deserve the same -- or even more extreme punishment . and if the punishment fit the crime -- it would deter white collar criminals -- and thus , white collar crime would be reduced . thanks for reading . i would love to hear your thoughts on the subject . if you have any alternative ideas as to how to combat white collar crime i would love to hear that as well . ----------------- my view is left unchanged as of yet ... ( however my title is very flawed . it states my veiw kinda poorly . ) i will edit here to reflect my current position . 1 - gave a delta to u/automaticdesign for being technically correct and helping me redefine "" white-collar crime "" as "" state-corporate crime . "" i was n't really trying to come up with the most heinous crime -- just the one that causes the most harm nowadays . 2 - users u/john","although if i am talking a position , i agree with the law . what you 're describing has some interesting parallels with a disputed question in common law jurisprudence - should fraud be punished more harshly than theft / robbery ? the reasoning goes , theft and robbery are more intrusive and physically more violent ( break and enters , need to physically take property ) whereas fraud is much more indirect and cowardly form of theft . on the other hand , the argument is that a prudent person can take some safeguards against theft and robbery , but there is no protection against fraud . white collar crimes have a low recidivism rate , and people committing them usually pay much less attention to the actual penalty ( often not even bothering to know it ) and much more to the low likelihood of being caught . accordingly , we should be reducing rather than increasing the penalty for white collar crimes . we perhaps should spend more effort in catching corrupt politicians and investigating corporate crimes - but that should be alongside smaller not larger punishment . "" white collar crime "" as a whole is a very broad area . regarding the larger scope crimes that i believe you were thinking of , those already do carry very high penalties . i completely agree that white collar criminals ought to be treated much more harshly than they currently are . however , i think part of the logic of treating them less harshly than violent offenders is that money is ( at least in theory ) recoverable . "" white-collar crime "" refers to financial fraud crimes ( fbi , wikipedia ) . while these are very bad , are you sure that you want to say that they 're worse than genocide and war crimes , which can also destabilize entire countries and harm millions ?"
