Noting that there are studies on the fact that the frequency of crime does not decrease as penalties increase, experts say that research shows that the relationship between crime and punishment is not a deterrent.

Stating that all five sense organs are trained to stay away from the haram during Ramadan, Prof. Emine Yeniterzi from the Institute for Sufi Studies said that the expectation that crime and the tendency to crime will decrease during the spiritual months is not unfounded. Yeniterzi pointed out that in the past years, it is known that the tendency to crime decreased by 15 to 20 percent during the month of Ramadan.

Üsküdar University Institute for Sufi Studies Deputy Director and Head of the Department of Sufi Culture and Literature Prof. Emine Yeniterzi evaluated the issue of reducing the tendency to crime during the spiritual months.

"Solidarity and social justice are among the basic principles of Islam"

Stating that research shows that there is a linear relationship between poverty and crime rate, Prof. Emine Yeniterzi said that "Solidarity and social justice are among the basic principles of Islam, and within the spiritual inclusiveness of our religion, not only certain months and days, but also a continuity permeated by tradition is essential. However, the month of Ramadan, which brings spiritual peace to Rajab, Shaban and all Muslims, positively affects social life with its different dynamics, both individually and socially."

"Ramadan is the month of mercy and forgiveness. Ramadan is the month of the Qur'an"

Regarding the month of Ramadan, Yeniterzi stated that "Ramadan is the month of mercy and forgiveness. Ramadan is the month of the Quran. The night of power is the most virtuous night of the year. Therefore, this month, Muslims pay more attention to reading the Qur'an in their daily routines, reciprocations are made every day, and the whole of the Qur’an is read. Ramadan is the month of fasting. As a basic obligation, it means fasting for one month a year for Muslims.” Prof. Emine Yeniterzi and also said:

"An important worship of Ramadan nights is the tarawih prayers, which are performed with the congregation, preferably in mosques. Ramadan is the month of zakat. It is also obligatory for those who are well-to-do to give alms of fitr, which is called fitrah among the people, until the Eid al-Fitr. Therefore, Ramadan is essentially a month that supports both the deepening of the individual in one’s inner world and socialization. Iftars are opened at common tables, prayers are performed together, the Qur'an is read, and social life is experienced by chatting together after iftar. The harmony brought about by this union raises an unspeakable value, both physically and spiritually."

The interaction between spiritual months and crime

Stating that studies on the fact that the frequency of crime does not decrease as penalties increase, show that the relationship between crime and punishment is not a deterrent, Prof. Emine Yeniterzi said that "Of course, the concepts of crime and criminal cannot be evaluated away from individual equipment. However, the expectation that crime and the tendency to crime will decrease during the spiritual months is not unfounded. The month of Ramadan gives the best example of this. It is known that in the past years, the tendency towards crime decreased by 15 to 20 percent during the month of Ramadan."

"Access to the most basic needs becomes easier during Ramadan"

Noting that it is possible to consider the reason for this decline in two dimensions, Prof. Emine Yeniterzi expressed that "For the material dimension, during Ramadan, access to the most basic needs becomes easier. Soup kitchens, municipalities, public institutions, and the private sector set up tables and distribute food. Tables are set up that overflow into the streets. A homeless who is hungry in the neighborhood and whom you would be afraid to pass by on a normal day and the local authority of the neighborhood meet at the same table. Aid starting from the nearest surroundings to villages you have never met is made during these months. Zakat gives this opportunity at least once a year to a Muslim who does not go to bed full while their neighbor is hungry. Although the fitrs do not flow in the same way, they drip. A seemingly small financial support turns into a huge help for those in need. Without saying more or less, the month in which the most sharing is done is the month of Ramadan. It is known that this month, hidden in its abundance, brings wealth in the material sense."

"All five of the senses are trained to stay away from the haram"

Pointing out the spiritual dimension, Prof. Emine Yeniterzi stated that "In Islamic literature, there are four holy months in which war is considered haram. This acceptance alone is extremely important to prevent violence, even for justified reasons. The month of Ramadan is a month that shows people their own helplessness and inadequacy. It requires getting rid of all habits and being in decency not only with hunger, but also with all limbs. No bad words come out of the mouth. All five of the senses are trained to stay away from the haram. It is a month in which self-conscious people, who cannot control their nerves on an ordinary day, are involuntarily taken away from their aggressive state to react to the other person. In a perspective that opens up from the individual to the society, this situation spreads calmness and serenity."

"During the month of Ramadan, Muslims pray and desire to cleanse themselves of their past sins"

Explaining that the doors of divine grace are opened wide to everyone who prays and that the worship of these people will be especially accepted by Allah in this month, Prof. Emine Yeniterzi said that "During the month of Ramadan, Muslims desire to benefit from the blessings of this month and to be cleansed of their past sins by praying. In the spiritual sense, Muslims who fall behind in their daily routine worship become more sensitive and careful to benefit from the grace of Ramadan. The first Friday prayer of Ramadan is the best example of this. Again, in a perspective that opens up from the individual to the society, this situation channels the collective energy in a positive direction."

"Fasting and zakat educate people spiritually and morally."

Head of the Department of Sufi Culture and Literature, Prof. Emine Yeniterzi concluded her words as follows:

"Ramadan is a month of good morals. It teaches sharing in both material and spiritual dimensions, being one and unity. It speaks of understanding, empathy and tolerance. Mevlana says, 'Fasting says: one does not eat their own halal goods, know that there is no way for them to lay hands on the haram anymore. Zakat says; one even gives their own property, how can a person steal from someone else?', fasting and zakat educate people spiritually and morally."
