2021 Census: As UK Population Grows, So Do British Muslim Communities

The population of England & Wales stands at 59.60 million; the Muslim population is 3.87 million, or 6.5 % of the total.

As the overall England and Wales population grows by 3.52 million in the decade 2011-2021, so do Muslim communities by 1.16 million contributing to 33% of the increase.

Muslims are becoming more dispersed across England and Wales, compared to other minority faith groups, warranting further analysis.

The top 5 locales with the largest Muslim populations are Birmingham, 341,811; Bradford, 166,846; London Borough of Tower Hamlets, 123,912; Manchester, 122,962; the London Borough of Newham,122, 146.

Analysis by the Muslim Council of Britain indicates that 40% of the Muslim population of England reside in the most deprived fifth of local authority districts; almost half a million more Muslims now live in these most deprived locales than in 2011.

Today the Muslim Council of Britain presents its initial analysis of British Muslim numbers following the publication of further findings of the 2021 Census from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), including responses to the religion and ethnicity questions.

The data tells us that the Muslim population in England and Wales on Census Day was 3.87 million. The Muslim population has increased by 1.16 million since 2011, when the figure stood at 2.71 million. The increase coincides with the growth in the total population from 56.08 million in 2011, to 59.60 million. The Muslim numbers account for 33% of the population rise. In 2011, Muslims formed 4.8% or just under 1 in 20 of the population in 2011. Now it stands at 6.5 %, or just under 1 in 15.

In addition, the Northern Ireland Statistics Research Agency reports a Muslim population of 10,870, compared to 3,832 in 2011. While we await data from the 2022 Scottish census, we know the Muslim population of Scotland in 2011 was 76,737.

What the data tells us about British Muslims

Based on the findings released today by the ONS, the Muslim Council of Britain offers an early assessment of the 2022 Census and how this relates to British Muslims. The data suggests that:

Muslims form 6.5% of the overall population. This stands in sharp contrast to rhetoric and perception suggesting the number is much higher.

Overall, the UK continues to be a more diverse nation, with the minority ethnic population standing at 18% of the overall population, compared to 14% in 2011. This needs to be reflected in our public life and in our key institutions.

Growth is driven by a younger population born in this country, people who are second and third generation British Muslims contributing to the UK’s economic recovery and vibrancy.

Migration is also a factor for growth, with new arrivals coming from countries affected by conflict and climate change.

Muslims are starting to spread out of concentrated conurbations, confirming a trend that has been underway since 2011.

Muslims still face disproportionate levels of deprivation. Analysis by the Muslim Council of Britain indicates that 40% of the Muslim population of England reside in the most deprived fifth of local authority districts; almost 482,000 more Muslims now live in these most deprived locales than in 2011.

Furthermore, whilst Islam continues to be the largest non-Christian faith group, all faith leaders have cause for introspection as those identifying as ‘no religion’ has increased to 35% (from 25% in 2011). Nonetheless, this should not be an excuse to deny religious rights, or discount the valuable role religion has in the public square.

Commenting on the latest Census data, MCB Secretary General Zara Mohammed said:

“While our nation has an increasingly ageing population, the contribution to the work force of a youthful Muslim population remains a strategic national asset. The last decade has seen more second and third generation Muslims, confident of our faith and place in society, contributing immensely to the economic recovery and vitality of our nation.”

“There are, of course, areas of concern, particularly where many Muslim communities disproportionately impacted by deprivation. This is especially worrying given the concern on access to opportunity and inclusion. Policy makers now need to address these concerns, communities cannot continue to be left in cycles of poor social mobility. Young people cannot have a bright future if they do not have the best opportunities available to them.

“Whilst the Census does look at religion, the lack of wider religion-specific monitoring prevents us from fully understanding how acute the issue of under-representation of Muslims is in British society.

“These initial figures give us an opportunity to now make meaningful change and create a better Britain for all.”

The population identifying as Christian has dropped from 59 % in 2011 to 46% this time. Islam continues to be the largest non-Christian faith group. However, Zara Mohammed offered a further reflection on the Census output: “taking a broader look at the data, the increase in the number of respondents stating, ‘No religion’ – from 25% in 2011 to 37% in 2021 – is cause for introspection for faith leaders: how are people fulfilling the natural quest for spirituality?”

The Government’s ‘Levelling Up the United Kingdom’ programme has identified the need for resource allocation in rural local authority districts, but if this policy is to deliver a truly equitable allocation of resources, then the needs of deprivation in our urban centres also need to be addressed.

The onus is on policy makers to engage with representative community bodies who are aware of ground realities and the lived experience of deprived pockets in society.

(The religion question is voluntary but was answered by 94% of the population of England and Wales. The MCB was an active member of the interfaith alliance that lobbied successfully for the religion question in the Census, first appearing in 2001.)
