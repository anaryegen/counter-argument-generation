I think Islam is a disgusting, putrid Religion, and has absolutely no place in western society, also wearing a hijab is not a part of feminism.

The only argument against the wrong they do is that, it's the minority, the moooderates are the real muslims! But in reality, when you take a look at any study, ANY study done on the moderate beliefs, they still believe homosexuality should be punished, adultery should be punished, ECT.

Regardless of that, in almost every major country, there is a death penalty for being gay, yet LGBT would proudly march with them, and condemn the christian, it's fucking amazing that this terrible, hate filled religion is put on a fucking pedestal but none of these people could thrive and exist in a society run by them.

Also explain to me how the fucking Hijab, which was created by a man for a female to wear, have anything to do with feminism? It's a fucking LITERAL censership on your body, by a man forcing you to wear it or you get stoned, fined, jailed, whatever.

People are fucking delusional, and the rape rates skyrocket in countries where islam goes. Sweden, Germany and France are now top 10 for rapes, Congratulations! , you guys somehow manage to not be able to behave in any western society, yet everyone still thinks you can.

Also how come any study done on islam, with hundreds of thousand of moderate muslims are thrown out the window if they are against basic freedoms for homosexuals, but when that SAME FUCKING STUDY says "oooh but they are accepting of another Abrahamic religion, aww how moderate" They go "see not so bad!" Fuck that. Any religion that has child brides in this day and age is sickening, and anyone who defends it is a loser.

Also, before any Neo-Nazis think i'm one of you, I am not, I think you are just as silly as antifa and you should probably get a job.

Popular opinion of the silent majority

Idk about that. On Reddit maybe

Nah. Regular adults with families and jobs, be they black or white, agree with OP and would say it in the private company of their friends and family.

But these are not the people who have time to be SJWs, the have actual lives, so you will never see them on TV or writing op eds for the newspaper. But they are the type to vote for Trump.

The silent majority is not the 7 people in the midwest

Then we agree, it's people everywhere. Thanks.

Actually we don't. People often use silent majority as a euphemism to comfort themselves, but liberal and democratic candidates have continually won the popular vote for the past 25 years.

The question is about Islam, not liberalism. According to PEW research, 50% of Americans say Islam is not part of mainstream society.

Half of respondents also say Islam conflicts with democracy.

So if you want to be nit-picky, the silent half of the population agrees with OP.

They don't necessarily share the same contempt, and most say similar things about other religions.

I don't think dead people have opinions.

In the context of Europe you're pretty spot on IMO. But I think why liberals in the US defend muslims so much is because US muslims are way more liberal than muslims around the world. They really are just normal people here. 52% of US muslims accept homosexuality. Up 25% from 2007. That's the same as protestants, way more than evangelicals (34%), and more than black protestants(50%). And those other groups havent seen the rapid increase like US muslims have. Mellenial muslims poll at 60%. Not much different than the general public at 63% and higher than boomers at 54%.

This is such a shit comparison.

"Us muslims are way more liberal than these conservative europe muslims"

You might aswell announce that you think europe is backswards

AwfullyHotCovfefe_97

The European Muslims are able to self ghettoise a lot more easily due to the number of them which perpetuates the more backward ideologies. In the US they have to integrate (mostly).

Reddit shits on Christians for believing in a man in the sky but freaks the fuck out when people say theres something wrong with a religion about stoning women. Islam itself is ok, as long as Christianity is as well, but the extreme side of religion needs to go. Laws should not be based on religion

Devils advocate, but isn't freedom of expression a western ideal ?

oh boy here we go again

All religions are stupid. Beliefs in entities never be seen, and yet they compel to do stuff or else...

Even more so when you realize that science evolved, and the Church who was so adamant about the Earth being flat, and that non Caucasian people were not actually humans among many other stuffs was and is still full of shit.

And you realize that all religions are propaganda destined to keep people in line out of fear. All religions are based on old tales thousand years ago that nobody can conveniently check the facts of. Most of the Ancient Testament is composed of Jewish , and other middle eastern tales, which were modified because of oral transmission.

I know nothing about Islam, but being forced to go to that same stupid church out of tradition because both of my parents were Christians was not good either.

So instead of spitting on Islam which actually was a vicious political tool written for war and to unite spread Arabs tribes, spit on all religions equally. Or are you going to conveniently ignore all the shit Christians did in the name of God too ?

Religion is not the problem, its the people that use it to gain power

Someth1ngsometh1ng25

Yeah Islam is a fucked up religion and culture.

Let's be frank... the developed world, be it in Europe or Asia or America, never needed a single Muslim.

Single RADICAL Muslim

Non-extremist Muslims are fine, just so long as they intergrate.

The obvious fact is that, sure. we can tolerate a few of them, but at no point do we ever need them.

Yes. YES. A million times YES. Someone had to post this.

It was invented by a pedophile war lord so yes.

Except Islam and all other abrahamic religions are all equal and preach the same things, yet Islam gets the most shit because they're brown.

Actually they get the most shit because they actively follow their Quran 100 percent through, oh and throw gays of buildings.. terrorist attacks.. Human rights violations that seem unending, but yes, its totaaaaaally because they are brown and not just sick humans.

Actually they get the most shit because they actively follow their Quran 100 percent through

The same could be argued of any other religion was filed 100%.

oh and throw gays of buildings.. terrorist attacks.. Human rights violations that seem unending

You realize your examples are all products of regional instability caused by western nations? If the middle east did to the west what we did to them, we would see the same things happening here in the name of christianity.

But we don't I don't care much about whataboutism

What a nonsense point. You blaming the middle east is like trashing someone's home and blaming them for being messy.

Yeah man I remember back in 07 when I was shootin muzzies from my Apache helicopter.

When I was born, in 1995 I lived in fucking japan until I was 8 years old lmao.

Yeah, but you understand that the hijab is only bad when it's being forced onto people.

If someone's, say, in a Western country and therefore was under no obligation to wear a hijab, it wouldn't be oppressive.

Unless of course you account for how wearing a hijab in the West opens the door for people to discriminate against you, but that's a little different.

No obligation? Yeah, Family pressure, religious pressure totally do not exist. If you think a woman would stand up to her muslim family, and muslim husband without harm, you are fooling yourself.

Then it's not the hijab that's oppressive, it's the people who are forcing the hijab onto people.

It's not the guillotine that is oppressive, it's the people putting others in it that is deadly.

Still was made for the same purpose, one to kill, one to oppress.

It's a fucking piece of cloth. It's cloth.

That if you don't wear you are a whore, and could be stoned in all countries that it is MANDATED you wear it.

That, my friend, sums up my opinion !! Have my vote !

Love your finishing statement.

All of the abrahamic mythologies are a joke, and have no place in any modern society.

I have to respectfully disagree. Wearing a hijab proves that you are a serious independent woman. Most women at my office wears skirts and high heels not suitable for a work environment. It makes them looks less competent and like they are there to find a man. While Wearing a hijab proves, your loyalty to your husband and that you are there to do a job. It makes people view you more seriously and not just as a sex object.

I actually can't tell if this is a sarcastic comment, or that you truly believe that if she went home without her hijab, her husband would totally not beat her.

In Islam it is forbidden for the husband to beat his wife, unless it is absolutely necessary to discipline her. If he have to, it is strictly forbidden to hit her in the face, do real damage or make her ugly. There are etiquette to follow, so people that say Muslims are wife beaters are misguided. I have proudly worn the hijab from when I got married to my husband when I was 10 years old. If I take it off it is within my husband right to discipline me, as he would be inviting other men to me if he didn't, and loose my respect.

lol okay we get it your trolling/making a point

Maybe an opinion where there's too many who agree for anyone to get shitty about it.

Yeah. Islam promotes pedophilia and the killing of infidels. The only reason why all those sjws support it is because it’s run by brown people

Be careful. I made a post like this some time ago, and got absolutely shit on for my post history any time i would post anywhere else. That being said, I completely agree with your opinion. Take my upvote

I don't care, people try to dox me all the time and the only thing I can say to you is, go for it, I really don't give a fuck, my trust fund wont magically drain, I won't really get "Fired" I'll be let down and still get that fucking salary since its a family owned company, in the private sector so no one would really give a fuck anyways.

Let them come, the left has a thing for doxing people, so let em have their fun I say!

Anyone who thinks hijabs are a part of feminism has autism. They have to wear it. It’s so oppressive

how is this unpopular?

I see you are a follower of Muhammad.

Yes they are degenerates. Islam is also degenerate. Only good thing about Islam is that they stone gays
