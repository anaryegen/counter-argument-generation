"Inside Every Progressive Is A Totalitarian Screaming To Get Out" —David Horowitz

Are Muslims ‘Invading’ the UK?

No, but what’s happening is much worse.

December 6, 2022 by Raymond Ibrahim 40 Comments

The secretary of the United Kingdom’s Home Office, which regulates immigration, recently caused a scandal by referring to the nonstop immigration of mostly Muslim migrants as an “invasion.” On Oct. 30, 2022, Suella Braverman said:

The British people deserve to know which party is serious about stopping the invasion on our southern coast and which party is not… Some 40,000 people have arrived on the south coast this year alone, many of them facilitated by criminal gangs, some of them actual members of criminal gangs. So let’s stop pretending that they are all refugees in distress: the whole country knows that that is not true…. I’m utterly serious about ending the scourge of illegal migration and I am determined to do whatever it takes to break the criminal gangs and fix our hopelessly lax asylum system…

Needless to say, such frank assertions “sparked an instant backlash from all sectors of the globalist establishment in Britain, from the legacy media to politicians in both the Labour Party and the Conservatives.”

Meanwhile, and seemingly confirming Braverman’s concerns, outrageous numbers of migrants, the overwhelming majority arriving from the Muslim world, have indeed flooded the UK. According to one report, in just the first half of 2021, “an astonishing 1.1 million visas [were] granted for people to come and live in the UK… It is the highest number of visas for people to come and live here ever issued in one year, suggesting that, despite repeated promises to control and reduce immigration, the government are delivering the opposite.”

Then there is the huge “number of applicants awaiting decisions on asylum” in the UK, which has risen by 300% in four years.

According to yet another source, “In 2021, the top five most common countries of nationality of people who applied for asylum in the UK were Iran, Iraq, Eritrea, Albania and Syria.” With the exception of Eritrea, which is roughly half Muslim, half Christian, every one of these nations is overwhelmingly Muslim majority.

Incidentally, these numbers are separate from the pre-existing Muslim population of the UK, which, in 2017—before the recent migrant influx—was well over four million, or 6.3 percent of the entire, formerly Christian, population.

Little wonder that the name “Muhammad” is the most popular name for newborn baby boys in England; little wonder that Muslims in the UK and other Western European nations with large Muslim populations, regularly boast of demography as destiny. As one report explained in 2008, “Muslim hate fanatics plan to take over Britain by having more babies and forcing a population explosion… The swollen Muslim population would be enough to conquer Britain from inside, they claim.”

Despite all of this, is it correct to refer to this Muslim migrant explosion an invasion?

In fact, it is not. Consider some authoritative dictionary definitions of “invasion”:

Merriam-Webster: an “incursion of an army for conquest or plunder… an instance of invading a country or region with an armed force. … an unwelcome intrusion into another’s domain.

Cambridge: “an occasion when an army or country uses force to enter and take control of another country.”

Oxford: “the act of an army entering another country by force in order to take control of it.”

Now, to be sure, and as chronicled here and here, Muslims have, for over a millennium, launched countless military invasions into Europe that very much conformed to these definitions. They came as an “army,” used “force to enter and take control” of various nations, and all “for conquest or plunder.”

While some of these invasions saw the long term conquest of European nations—Spain, the Mediterranean islands, the Balkans—jihadist invasions that did not lead to conquest but acquired much by way of booty and slaves were habitually launched against virtually every corner of Europe, as far as Iceland. Indeed, from 1627 to 1633, Lundy, an island off the west coast of Britain, was actually occupied by Muslim pirates from North Africa, who pillaged England at will.

Moreover, many of today’s Muslims who migrant to Europe harbor the same motives of “conquest and plunder,” which in Rotherham, England, for example, saw thousands of young British girls turned into sex slaves.

Even so, the all-important ingredient that would qualify what is happening today as an “invasion” is missing: Muslims are not entering the UK by “force,” against the UK’s will. They are being welcomed in by the government and authorities of the UK—those most charged with protecting and maintaining the national character of the UK.

This is why, Eastern Europe—which, thanks to its geographic proximity to Islam, has historically bore the brunt of and suffered from invading Islam—is not suffering now. Unlike the UK and many other Western European nations, Poland, Hungary, and their like have simply said no to migration from Muslim nations; and their native citizens are thanking them for it.

In short, if you’re invited in, you cannot be called an “invader”—regardless of your intentions. Thus, and at the risk of appearing to quibble over semantics, what is happening today all throughout the West in general and the UK in particular must be seen and called out for what it actually is: not an unstoppable invasion, but an assisted suicide.

The country has been overrun by muslims particularly in the cities which have become more and more like third world shit holes, not just one city but almost all of them.

We have developed good relationships with the likes of Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi but these relationships have become ways for them to fund the building of mosques, hundreds if not thousands of mosques.

This is what is I understand described as taqquia how to spell it I don’t know but it’s basically what we would describe as deliberately misleading undermining lies.

A little bit like communism really.

December 6, 2022 at 5:55 pm

Rotterham comes to mind. Malmo comes to mind.

In Paris these islam refuse sit deliberately on the sidewalk, to force others to walk out in the street. They take up tables at cafés to screw with the owners. They sometimes get bored with it, and park car bombs in front of Notre Dame. The bomb didn’t go off, but the cathedral burned the next day.

Liberal politicians reliably make excuses for all of it.

December 7, 2022 at 8:52 am

When you see a koranimal sitting on the sidewalk, why don’t you kick him in the face? And sock up the ones sitting in cafes without paying for anything?

Jeff, do you know about Cousin Marriage, because it’s all Muslims who marry their cousins.. Wiki “Cousin Marriage”: “In Pakistan, cousin marriage is legal and common. Reasons for consanguinity are economic, religious and cultural.[151] Data collected in 2014 from the Malakand District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province (KPK), Pakistan showed that around 66.4% of marriages among rural couples were to a first or second cousin.[152][153][154] In some areas, higher proportion of first-cousin marriages in Pakistan has been noted to be the cause of an increased rate of blood disorders in the population.[154]”

Urban Hammar notes that a passage from the tantra mentions a series of figures who are said to be in the service of demonic snakes. These figures are “Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, “The white-clad one”, Muhammed and Mathani.” Hammar adds that “Muhammed and his teaching of Islam is presented as a barbaric teaching and consequently the main enemy of Buddhism.”[75]

According to John Newman, passages from the Vimalaprabhā also mention a year from the Islamic calendar (403 AH, 1012-1013 CE).[76][7] This supports the dating of this Kālacakra tradition text to the 11th century by Tibetan and Western scholars, as well as the link to the Indian history of that era which saw conflicts with Islamic Ghaznavid invaders.[76] Alexander Berzin also notes that Tibetan sources mention the “barbarians” slaughtering cattle while reciting the name of their god, the veiling of women, circumcision, and five daily prayers facing their holy land, all of which leaves little doubt that the prophecy part of the text is referring to Muslims.[77] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalachakra#Shambhala_kingdom_and_its_holy_war_with_the_barbarians

December 7, 2022 at 5:47 pm

Do you know about Buddhism’s prophecy relating to Islam in the Ngorpa Kalachakra that predicts the revelation of a hidden country called Shambhala?

December 6, 2022 at 7:04 pm

Invasion or surrender? Oddly enough the word islam translated correctly means surrender. How they do it is fairly simple. First they send a smaller group of jihadis to fully learn and study the culture, while pretending to be assimilated and productive, peaceful people. Their mission is to take higher positions in the education system, the media and the government. They also brainwash, bribe or threaten many natives into joining the “gang.” Directly or indirectly. Their main purpose is to destroy the nation’s identity and culture. By targeting native religion and patriotism, and demonizing it’s history. And by banning any criticism of islam. Once they have done enough of this evil invasion plot, the Trojan gates are opened, and we see what’s happening today. Total destruction of a nation is not that far away. To undo this damage the same strategy must be used in a more aggressive manner. One can never win if one is not more aggressive than the enemies.

December 7, 2022 at 7:40 am

I suspect the idiot who placed the “down vote” is a brainwashed fool cosseted in his gated cloister, free of these migrants. Guess we can’t call this invading horde “illegal” when politicians open the gates and let ’em flood on in. (Otherwise our politicians might be called Islamophobes.)

It was noteworthy how the cloistered ones living on Martha’s Vineyard wanted their domain to stay cloistered. The 48 illegals were ejected in less than 48 hours.

December 7, 2022 at 8:56 am

Naw, they take over openly because the government welcomes them. The UK and Ameican governments are to blame, not our people. Lefties are a minority in public but our governments cater to them.

Unless we have new revolutions, we’re doomed.

December 6, 2022 at 7:10 pm

First and foremost the islam must be demonized. It is very easy to do. Islamic nations and islamic history and the ideology itself is full of evil. Violence, oppression, hate, racism, terrorism, genocide after genocide. And an utter lack of progress in economy, arts or science. Once the natives have a true and factual understanding of this evil ideology, it can be banned outright, or at least any affiliates can be removed from their positions. Starting with the leaders in the government, education system and the media. The rest would be easy. Ban the immigration, revoke citizenships and deport, and those who remain should assimilate and respect native culture, or given the option to “migrate” to any of the 50 islamic countries.

December 7, 2022 at 7:44 am

Your idea is sound and has merit. Only thing wrong with it, is politicians fear being called “Islamophobes”, and the selfsame politicians live in gated communities where they won’t have to live with the consequences.

Geoffrey Britain says

December 6, 2022 at 9:18 pm

The correct term for Muslim migration into Europe and specifically the UK is “Hijrah”, which translates as “migratory Jihad”.

December 6, 2022 at 10:19 pm

Thank Obama and Merkel for creating this “invasion”.

December 7, 2022 at 7:45 am

Both are indifferent fools. Both know they are the ones who won’t have to live among them.

Have you seen the article in Newsweek about Muslim crap Obama?

Belief Watch; Is Obama the Antichrist?

BY NEWSWEEK STAFF (Senior Editor Lisa Miller) ON 11/14/08

On Nov. 5, Todd Strandberg was at his desk, fielding E-mails from around the world. As the editor and founder of RaptureReady.com, his job is to track current events and link them to biblical prophecy in hopes of maintaining his status as “the eBay of prophecy,” the best source online for predictions and calculations concerning the end of the world. Already Barack Obama had drawn the attention of apocalypse watchers after an anonymous e-mail circulated among conservative Christians in October implying that he was the Antichrist. Former “Saturday Night Live” ingénue Victoria Jackson fueled the fire when, according to news reports, she wrote on her Web site that Obama “bears traits that resemble the anti-Christ.” Now Strandberg was receiving up-to-the-minute news from his constituents in Illinois. One of the winning lottery numbers in the president-elect’s home state was 666— which, as everyone knows, is the sign of the Beast (also known as the Antichrist). “It is very eerie, and I take it for a sign as to who he really is,” wrote one of Strandberg’s correspondents.

Around the 1970’s we were being told due to world over-population we should not have babies or at least not more than one or two. China even limited their people for a while to 1 or 2 children. But why has no one mentioned to Islamist or Hispanics that are invading the UK, EU or the US not to have so many children?

William James Ward says

December 6, 2022 at 10:41 pm

Sadly, England is gone, invaded and taken over without a shot fired, subverted by idiot politicians who supported the invasion, dark days ahead.

December 7, 2022 at 7:58 am

Dark days indeed, but not for the politicians. They believe their gated communities are secure.

The fools believe they won’t be eaten at all, but the proverbial alligator will get it’s fill . . . although they probably will be last. (Gated communities are limited, afterall.)

December 7, 2022 at 9:06 am

Gated communities are pretty cool when politicians don’t live in them. Indian Wells in the Palm Springs area is a gated city and it’s grand. I could never afford to live there but my great uncle did and all he had to do to reach the green was walk out his glass doors to his patio. They have major golf tournaments there every year.

Being wealthy is nice and guys like him who earned it deserve it.

December 8, 2022 at 8:35 am

I have zero problem with an American citizen getting rich in this merit-based country.

I do have a problem with those rich pricks stuffing illegals & low-lifes into our neighborhoods, all the while keeping their living areas scrubbed of any of it.

Rotterham & Malmo were turned into living hell cesspools. Many other “No go zone” examples abound. Pricks like B. Hussein, Sleazy Joe, and Slick Willie keep their cloisters free of it. The “little guys” that politicians claim to advocate . . . well . . . don’t have that option.

December 6, 2022 at 11:06 pm

the Biden regime invites illegal immigration, although it does not specify the religion or race of the migrant flows. I.nstead of an invasion, perhaps a flood is a better term. In the case of the Dem party, they want to hurt America for their benefit as the ruling class. So they are in a sense allied with enemies of the US, and the migrants are their cannon fodder

December 7, 2022 at 8:07 am

When puppet *Big guy” was V.P., the Obama administration spent serious money to deport the Romeike family. Why? It’s so simple. The Romeike family was intact, Christian, hard working, smart & educated, accepted no welfare, spoke English, and home-schooled their children. (So with such quality traits, they had to go.)

What makes this collapse of the West possible? Altruism does. You can call it suicidal altruism but suicidal is redundant.

The moral conviction that self-preservation IS the first moral principle does not stem from altruism but from Ayn Rand’s moral code of rational sellfishness — the West needs to discover that rational moral code if it wishes to survive.

“Unable to resolve a lethal contradiction, the conflict between individualism, [capitalism], and altruism, the West is giving up. When men give up reason and freedom, the vacuum is filled by faith and force.” – Ayn Rand

December 7, 2022 at 12:39 am

“No social system can stand for long without a moral base. Project a magnificent skyscraper being built on quicksands: while men are struggling upward to add the hundredth and two-hundredth stories, the tenth and twentieth are vanishing, sucked under by the muck. That is the history of capitalism, of its swaying, tottering attempt to stand erect on the foundation of the altruist morality.” – Ayn Rand

December 7, 2022 at 12:45 am

Quran (9:29) – “Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of the Book [Jews and Christians], until they pay the Jizya [the tax for being a Jew or Christian] with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.”

December 7, 2022 at 8:39 am

The islamists must be dumbfounded at how leftist fools are providing them all they could ask for & even more. (Taliban are still amazed what *Biden handed them.)

These same leftist fools will be more dumbfounded when they find out the islamists will turn on them when no longer needed.

Mexico’s First Muslim Immigrant Shelter: A U.S. National Security Perspective CIS travels to Tijuana to fill an information deficit By Todd Bensman, November 30, 2022 Excerpt: While immigrant shelters in Tijuana and other northern Mexican border cities brim mainly with Spanish-speakers, this two-story, 8,000-square-foot former bar is the only one that expressly caters to Muslims, who arrive by taxi and Uber daily at its gated door from all over the Islamic world, including Yemen, Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Lebanon, Egypt, Morocco, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Somalia, and other countries in the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia.

December 7, 2022 at 9:17 am

Sounds like a good target for a cruise missile.

December 7, 2022 at 11:05 pm

The fight against Islam of modern times is predicted in the old books. It’s easy to see.

December 7, 2022 at 12:48 am

What could possibly go wrong? Border Report reported Monday that “a shelter for Muslim migrants opened over the weekend in Tijuana, the first of its kind in all of Mexico.” This is no small-time effort: “The Latino Muslim Foundation, based in San Diego and Tijuana, raised half a million dollars to make the facility a reality.” Meanwhile, fifty people on the terror watch list have been apprehended at the Southern border so far this year, and there is no telling how many got across without being caught. Welcome to Old Joe Biden’s America.

December 7, 2022 at 2:20 am

All those foreign Muslims new entering the United Kingdom is a recipe for disaster. The reason why this is so is because some of them might actually be jihadist. Muslims just waiting for the “right” time to “go off “ as in them being human time bombs. It only take a few out of many to do much harm.

This Muslim violence may be yet better explained by one of the fables of Aesop which is entitled THE FARMER AND THE VIPER. So here it is “Once in ancient Greece there was a farmer outside on a very cold winter day walking in if field to make sure that everything is in order and as it should be. The farmer came upon a half-frozen viper about to die from the bitter cold. The kind yet foolish farmer took pity on the viper and in an action of kindness put it his is vest jacket to warms and up and thus save its life. The viper warned up revived and then bit farmer through the vest jacket. So the kind but foolish farmer died a slow painful death in awful agony because he felt sorry of the viper and saved it life. The point to this fable is the no amount of kindness will change and vicious and evil nature.

So it is with those Muslim migrants who were allowed to enter the UK to live . Those violent migrants who are Muslims will not be impress and change because kindness of Westerners. This is because those violent Muslims have that ungrateful dangerous viper nature because of their venomous and violent religion which is Islam.

December 7, 2022 at 9:56 pm

Can you read the “Cousin Marriage” Wikipage that speak about Islam and send quotes here please.

” Muhammad actually did marry two relatives.[20] One was a first cousin, Zaynab bint Jahsh, who was not only the daughter of one of his father’s sisters but was also divorced from a marriage with Muhammad’s adopted son, Zayd ibn Haritha.”

December 7, 2022 at 3:52 am

Do even one percent of claims of asylum from persecution prove valid?

Immigration reform is accomplished by Immigration moratorium.

Job one is apprehension of our fifty million law-evading visitors and bum rushing them out of here. Delays for court petitions don’t apply. Our courts are for our citizens.

That is very much the whole point.

Borders and citizenship make countries.

December 7, 2022 at 8:41 am

“Assisted suicide.” Yes, the Alzheimer Joe administration is doing that on our border with shithole Mexico (I’ve been there many times, unfortunately,) much like the United Kaliphate does with the islamopithecines. Six million illegal aliens in just under two years, that we know of.

America and the UK are finished. No country can recover from this shit.

Andrew Blackadder says

December 7, 2022 at 2:58 pm

Assisted suicide… Thats great… I will use that from now on though invasion also has the ring of truth in it as these muslims coming in are not coming with weapons but are coming with the notion of taking over the lands of the infidels…. Same same… The Islam Party in Belgium is openly declaring themselves to being a political party that wants Belgium to become an islamic Nation and that sharia will be the Law of the land for everybody. This political party is in Brussels, the Capital of Belgium but also the HQ of the EU so once Belgium becomes islamic what do you think happens to the EU and the rest of Europe. Im glad to be 74 and not 24.

December 7, 2022 at 4:52 pm

I’d like to tell you that I’ve done five years of Tibetan language and culture at Paris University (INALCO) and 45 years of research upon the Kalachakra text of the Ngorpa School of Tibet.

I’d like to get in contact with you because I’ve been able to find the fabled Kingdom of Shambhala described in the Kalachakra text and the finding of this land is predicted in the Buddhist texts.

December 7, 2022 at 8:15 pm

Check out Shambhala and Kalachakra in Wikipedia. It’s apocalyptical. The Muslims are destroyed. Wiki Kalachakra: (Shambhala paragraph) They combined their idea of Shambhala with Kalki to reflect the theo-political situation they faced after the arrival of Islam in Central Asia and western Tibet.[68][69] The text prophesies a war fought by a massive army of Buddhists and Hindus, led by King Raudra Kalkin, against the Muslim persecutors.[70] Then after the victory of good over evil and attainment of religious freedoms, Kalki ushers in a new era of peace and Sambhala will become a place of perfection.[71][72][70][73] Further battles with the barbarians are described as well in later eras.[74]

December 7, 2022 at 11:04 pm

Raymond, I am disappointed in your essay. The founding of Islam is based upon the MIGRATION of Mohammad and his motley crew from Mecca to Medina. Thus, migration is the blood that feeds the conquering soul of Islam. It does not matter whether they come as invited guests or whether they come as conquerors. They will conquer England and the EU regardless of the semantics.

December 8, 2022 at 10:33 pm

I sent a link to a Newsweek article that said Obama’s the Antichrist. Newsweek is a mid-stream magazine and not a fringe fake, made-up magazine. Did anyone see it? I mean are you people watching this all come down?
