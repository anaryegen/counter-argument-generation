Refuting Muhammad Permitted Muslims to steal from Non-Muslims

Asim ul Haq November 28, 2010 Refuting Allegations by Abul Kasem against Islam

14. Muhammad permitted Muslims to steal from non-Muslims.

Above Claim is again a clear lie of Abul Kasem INSHA`ALLAH I will prove first let us see what he claimed

Summary Answer: Muslims may not steal from each other. In fact, Muhammad had people’s hands cut off for that. But the same is not true of unbelievers. Property rights for them exist only at the discretion of their Muslim rulers. Unsubmissive infidels frequently had their property stolen from them by Muhammad’s warriors, which sometimes included wives and children

The basic Rule is a Muslim Can not steal from Non Mulims It is totally Prohibited, The only exception made by sharee’ah is the wealth of kaafirs who are waging war against the Muslims, That is killing them, Raping their Women etc see the evidence

It was narrated that al-Mugheerah ibn Shu’bah kept company with some people during the Jaahiliyyah. He killed them and took their wealth, then he came and entered Islam. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “As for your Islam, I accept it, and as for the wealth, I have nothing to do with it.” According to a report narrated by Abu Dawood, “As for your Islam, we accept it, and as for the wealth it is obtained through treachery, and we have no need of it.”(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2583; Abu Dawood, 2765; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 2403).

Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said: قولـه ” وأما المال فلستُ منه في شيءٍ ” أي : لا أتعرض له لكونه أخذه غدراً ، ويستفاد منه : أنه لا يحل أخذ أموال الكفار في حال الأمن غدراً ؛ لأن الرفقة يصطحبون على الأمانة ، والأمانة تؤدَّى إلى أهلها مسلِماً كان أو كافراً ، وأن أموال الكفار إنما تحل بالمحاربة والمغالبة ، ولعل النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم ترك المال في يده لإمكان أن يسلم قومه فيرد إليهم أموالهم .

The phrase “and as for the wealth, I have nothing to do with it” means, I will not touch it because it was obtained through treachery. What we learn from this is that it is not permissible to take the wealth of the kuffaar by treachery when they have trusted you and granted you safety, because when people accompany one another (when travelling), they do so on the basis of mutual trust, and that trust should not be betrayed, whether the other person is a Muslim or a kaafir. The wealth of the kuffaar is only permissible in the case of combat and war. Perhaps the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) let him keep the wealth in the hope that the people of its owner might become Muslim, then he could return their wealth to them. Fath al-Baari, 5/341

Al-Shaafa’i (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: وإذا دخل رجل مسلم دار الحرب بأمان .. وقدر على شيء من أموالهم لم يحل له أن يأخذ منه شيئاً قلّ أو كثر؛ لأنه إذا كان منهم في أمان فهم منه في مثله، ولأنه لا يحل له في أمانهم إلا ما يحل له من أموال المسلمين، وأهل الذمة ، لأن المال ممنوع بوجوه :

أولها إسلام صاحبه .

والثاني مال من له ذمة .

والثالث مال من له أمان إلى مدة أمانه وهو كأهل الذمة فيما يمنع من ماله إلى تلك المدة .

When a Muslim enters dar al-harb (the non-Muslim lands) on peaceful terms, and finds himself in position to take something of their wealth, it is not permissible for him to take it, whether it is a little or a lot, because if he is safe from them, they should be safe from him, and because it is not permissible for him to take anything from them when they have given him safety except what it is permissible for him to take from the wealth of the Muslims and ahl al-dhimmah (non-Muslims living under the protection of the Muslim state). Wealth may be forbidden for a number of reasons:

If the owner is a Muslim

if the owner is (a non-Muslim) living under the protection of the Muslim state

if the owner is one with whom there is a peace deal, until the deal expires; such people are considered to be like ahl al-dhimmah as far as the sanctity of their wealth is concerned, until the deal expires. Al-Umm, 4/284

Al-Sarkhasi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: أكره للمسلم المستأمِن إليهم في دينه أن يغدر بهم لأن الغدر حرام، قال صلى الله عليه وسلم : ” لكل غادر لواء يركز عند باب أسته يوم القيامة يعرف به غدرته “، فإن غدر بهم وأخذ مالهم وأخرجه إلى دار الإسلام كرهت للمسلم شراءه منه إذا علم ذلك لأنه حصله بكسب خبيث ، وفي الشراء منه إغراء له على مثل هذا السبب وهو مكروه للمسلم ، والأصل فيه حديث المغيرة بن شعبة رضي الله عنه حين قتل أصحابه وجاء بمالهم إلى المدينة فأسلم ، وطلب من رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم أن يخمس ماله ، فقال : ” أما إسلامك فمقبول ، وأما مالك فمال غدر فلا حاجة لنا فيه ” .

It is not right for a Muslim who is on peaceful terms with them to betray them, because betrayal is haraam. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Every betrayer will have a banner by his backside on the Day of Resurrection, by which his betrayal will be known.” If he betrays them and steals their wealth, and brings it to the Muslim lands, it is not right for a Muslim to buy from him if he knows about that, because he has obtained it in an evil manner, and buying from him is encouraging him in that, which it is not right for the Muslim to do. The basic principle in this matter is the hadeeth of al-Mugheerah ibn Shu’bah (may Allaah be pleased with him), when he killed his companions and brought their wealth to Madeenah and became Muslim, and asked the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to take the khums of his wealth, and he said, “As for your Islam, we accept it, and as for the wealth it is obtained through treachery, and we have no need of it.” Al-Mabsoot, 10/96

http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/14367/

Sura (5:38) – “As to the thief, Male or female, cut off his or her hands: a punishment by way of example, from Allah, for their crime: and Allah is Exalted in power.”

Sura (48:20) – “Allah promised you many acquisitions which you will take, then He hastened on this one for you and held back the hands of men from you, and that it may be a sign for the believers and that He may guide you on a right path.” Allah promises Muslims that they will profit materially in their war against unbelievers.

In first verse There is nothing which states stealing from Kuffar is allowed, second verse is talking about War

Ibne Kathir Commented

Mujahid said that Allah’s statement, ﴿وَعَدَكُمُ اللَّهُ مَغَانِمَ كَثِيرَةً تَأْخُذُونَهَا﴾

(Allah has promised you abundant spoils that you will capture,) refers to the spoils that Muslims earned up until this time, while,

﴿فَعَجَّلَ لَكُمْ هَـذِهِ﴾

(and He has hastened for you this,) means, the conquest of Khaybar. Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said,

﴿فَعَجَّلَ لَكُمْ هَـذِهِ﴾

(and He has hastened for you this,) means, “The peace treaty of Al-Hudaybiyyah.” Allah said,

﴿وَكَفَّ أَيْدِىَ النَّاسِ عَنْكُمْ﴾

(and He has restrained the hands of men from you,) meaning, `no harm that your enemies had planned against you, both fighting and warfare, touched you. Allah also restrained the hands of men, whom you left behind close to your families and children, from harming them,’

﴿وَلِتَكُونَ ءَايَةً لِّلْمُؤْمِنِينَ﴾

(that it may be a sign for the believers,) with which they take heed and understand. Verily, Allah the Exalted and Most Honored shall help and protect the believers against all enemies, even though the believers are few in number. By doing so, the believers will come to know that Allah is truly the Knower of the consequences of all matters and that the best decisions are those which He prefers for His believing servants, even though these decisions might look unfavorable outwardly(end quote)

Sura (33:27) – “And He caused you to inherit their land and their houses and their wealth, and land ye have not trodden. Allah is ever Able to do all things.” Referring again to the property of unbelievers, which is given to those Muslims who defeat them.

Again above verse is regarding Banu Quraiza

Ibn Kathir commented under 33:26

We have already noted that when the Confederates came and camped outside Al-Madinah, Banu Qurayzah broke the covenant that existed between them and the Messenger of Allah . This happened by the agency of Huyay bin Akhtab An-Nadari, may Allah curse him, who entered their stronghold and would not leave their leader, Ka`b bin Asad, alone until he agreed to break the covenant. Among the things that he said to him was, “Woe to you! This is the opportunity for glory. The Quraysh and their company of men from various tribes, and the Ghatafan and their followers, have come to you, and they will stay here until they eliminate Muhammad and his companions.” Ka`b said to him, “No, by Allah, this is the opportunity for humiliation. Woe to you, O Huyay, you are a bad omen. Leave us alone.” But Huyay kept trying to persuade him until he agreed to his request. He laid down the condition that if the Confederates went away without doing anything, he ﴿Huyay﴾ would join them in their stronghold and would share their fate. When Banu Qurayzah broke their covenant and news of this reached the Messenger of Allah , he and the Muslims were very distressed by that. (end quote)

Bukhari (81:780) – The Prophet said, “The hand should be cut off for stealing something that is worth a quarter of a Dinar or more.”

Bukhari (81:792) – Narrated Aisha: “The Prophet cut off the hand of a lady, and that lady used to come to me, and I used to convey her message to the Prophet and she repented, and her repentance was sincere.”

This Rule is applicable for all

Prophet Peace be upon him said, «أَمَّا بَعْدُ فَإِنَّمَا أَهْلَكَ الَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِكُمْ أَنَّهُمْ كَانُوا إِذَا سَرَقَ فِيهِمُ الشَّرِيفُ تَرَكُوهُ، وَإِذَا سَرَقَ فِيهِمُ الضَّعِيفُ أَقَامُوا عَلَيْهِ الْحَدَّ، وَإِنِّي وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَوْ أَنَّ فَاطِمَةَ بِنْتَ مُحَمَّدٍ سَرَقَتْ لَقَطَعْتُ يَدَهَا»

(Those who were before you were destroyed because when an honorable person among them would steal, they would leave him. But, when a weak man among them stole, they implemented the prescribed punishment against him. By Him in Whose Hand is my soul! If Fatimah the daughter of Muhammad stole, I will have her hand cut off.) Quoted by Ibne Kathir under Surah 5 verse 39

secondly, If the Muslim commits any sin, whether stealing or anything else, then repents before the matter is referred to the judge, then he is spared the punishment in that case, and it is not permissible to punish him, because Allaah says concerning banditry (interpretation of the meaning):

“The recompense of those who wage war against Allaah and His Messenger and do mischief in the land is only that they shall be killed or crucified or their hands and their feet be cut off from opposite sides, or be exiled from the land. That is their disgrace in this world, and a great torment is theirs in the Hereafter.

Except for those who (having fled away and then) came back (as Muslims) with repentance before they fall into your power; in that case, know that Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful”[al-Maa’idah 5:33-34]

see http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/7545/

Ibn Ishaq (764) – As for taking from unbelievers, perhaps the most illuminating example among many comes from the aftermath of the battle against the Khaybar as recorded by Muhammad’s earliest biographer. The Khaybar were a peaceful community of Jewish farmers who did not even know they were at war until Muhammad led his men against their town one morning, taking them by surprise and handily defeating them.

Not only did Muhammad take much of the town’s possessions and land, but he actually had the tribe’s treasurer, a man named Kinana, tortured until he gave up the location of hidden treasure. Muhammad then beheaded the man and “married” his traumatized widow, Safiyya (who passed through the hands of one of his lieutenant’s first due to the luck of the draw).

This is again a lie see replies by Brother Bassam Zawadi

b “Safiyyah, the Wife of Muhammad”

http://www.answering-christianity.com/bassam_zawadi/safiyyah_the_wife_of_the_prophet.htm

Bukhari (44:668) – “We were in the company of the Prophet at Dhul-Hulaifa. The people felt hungry and captured some camels and sheep (as booty)…” Muhammad said that Allah would always provide sustenance for those who believe in him. Stealing from non-Muslims was a legitimate means of fulfilling His promise.

Above is again a lie because that was not stealing They already had war booty with them, see the hadith

Bukhari Volume 3, Book 44, Number 684: Narrated Abaya bin Rifaa:

My grandfather, Rafi bin Khadij said, “We were in the valley of Dhul-Hulaifa of Tuhama in the company of the Prophet and had some camels and sheep (of the booty). The people hurried (in slaughtering the animals) and put their meat in the pots and started cooking. Allah’s Apostle came and ordered them to upset the pots, and distributed the booty considering one camel as equal to ten sheep. One of the camels fled and the people had only a few horses, so they got worried. (The camel was chased and) a man slopped the camel by throwing an arrow at it. Allah’s Apostle said, ‘Some of these animals are untamed like wild animals, so if anyone of them went out of your control, then you should treat it as you have done now.’ ” My grandfather said, “O Allah’s Apostle! We fear that we may meet our enemy tomorrow and we have no knives, could we slaughter the animals with reeds?” The Prophet said, “Yes, or you can use what would make blood flow (slaughter) and you can eat what is slaughtered and the Name of Allah is mentioned at the time of slaughtering. But don’t use teeth or fingernails (in slaughtering). I will tell you why, as for teeth, they are bones, and fingernails are used by Ethiopians for slaughtering. (See Hadith 668)

Social Drawback: In non-Islamic countries huge number of Muslims involved in illegal activities.

and there are many others, Author never tried to reveal their crime, as for Muslims let us see the fatwa

http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/7545/

He has repented from stealing from the kuffaar

Praise be to Allaah Who has honoured you by enabling you to repent, We ask Allaah to guide us all to the Straight Path and to make us steadfast in following it until death.

You should note that it is not permissible for the Muslims to cheat anyone and take his money unlawfully, even if he is a kaafir.

If the Muslim commits any sin, whether stealing or anything else, then repents before the matter is referred to the judge, then he is spared the punishment in that case, and it is not permissible to punish him, because Allaah says concerning banditry (interpretation of the meaning):

“The recompense of those who wage war against Allaah and His Messenger and do mischief in the land is only that they shall be killed or crucified or their hands and their feet be cut off from opposite sides, or be exiled from the land. That is their disgrace in this world, and a great torment is theirs in the Hereafter.

Except for those who (having fled away and then) came back (as Muslims) with repentance before they fall into your power; in that case, know that Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful”[al-Maa’idah 5:33-34]

And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The one who repents from sin is like one who never sinned.” And the one who did not sin cannot be punished.

Al-Ikhtiyaaraat al-Fiqhiyyah, p. 510-526; al-Mughni, 12/484

It was narrated from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them both) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, after al-Aslami had been stoned, “Avoid these immoral actions that Allaah has forbidden. Whoever does any of them, let him conceal that which Allaah has concealed, and let him repent to Allaah, for whoever tells us what he has done, we will carry out the ruling mentioned in the Book of Allaah on him.” (Narrated by al-Haakim in al-Mustadrak ‘ala’l-Saheehayn, 4/425; al-Bayhaqi, 8/330. This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Haakim, Ibn al-Sakan and Ibn al-Mulaqqin).

See al-Talkhees al-Habeer, 4/57; Khalaasat al-Badr al-Muneer, by Ibn al-Mulaqqin, 2/303.

Based on this, you do not have to go to the authorities and tell them about your stealing, rather it is sufficient for you to repent sincerely. But you have to return the money to its owners, because your repentance is not valid otherwise. You do not have to tell them that this is money that you stole from them, especially if you are afraid that they will put you in prison. What matters is returning the money etc to its owners. So you could put it in an envelope, or give it to someone who will give it to them, etc.

You must also return the government’s money, and the money of other people. If you do not know exactly how much the money was, then estimate what you think is most likely, i.e., pay until you are sure that you have done what you must do.

If you do not know who the owners of the money are, then you can give it in charity on their behalf.
