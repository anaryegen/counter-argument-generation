Fundraisers are urging people to take to the capital's restaurants and bars on Saturday night in a show of "unity and resilience" a week on from the terror attack.

The British Red Cross is calling for people to come together in a "Saturday Night for London" where they can take a "ride for London, eat a dish for London and say cheers to London."

Restaurants, including those in the area of the attack, will donate money from a chosen dish, while cafes, pubs and bars will ask for donations of the price of a drink.

Donald Hyslop, Borough Market chairman of trustees, said: "Borough Market is not just a collection of stalls, restaurants and pubs; it is a community of people.

"Never has that been more apparent than it is now, in this darkest of hours.

"This community has been shaken to its core by Saturday's horrific events, but bolstered by the love, togetherness and defiance of this vibrant, diverse city it will carry on doing what it has always done - celebrating the pleasures of good food and conversation."

Home affairs correspondent, BBC London

There's been a five-fold increase in Islamophobic incidents since the attack, the mayor of London has said.

There were 20 incidents reported yesterday - the 2017 daily average is 3.5.

There's also been a rise in hate crime reported to the Met since the attack, with 54 reports yesterday - the daily average in 2017 is 38.
