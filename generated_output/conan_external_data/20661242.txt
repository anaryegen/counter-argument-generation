Trump says terror attacks 'under-reported': Is that true?

Copy linkAbout sharing

Donald Trump: "All over Europe it's happening. It's gotten to a point where [attacks are] not even being reported."

US President Donald Trump has accused the media of under-reporting terror attacks, and produced a list to back up his claim. Is he right?

While on a visit to US Central Command, a wing of the Department of Defense, he warned of the danger posed by the Islamic State group.

"You have seen what happened in Paris and Nice. All over Europe it's happening," he said.

"It's gotten to a point where it's not even being reported. And in many cases the very, very dishonest press doesn't want to report it.

"They have their reasons, and you understand that."

Later in the day, the White House published a list of attacks "executed or inspired" by IS. Before the list was published, press secretary Sean Spicer said there were "several instances" of attacks that had not gained sufficient media coverage (without specifying which fell into that category).

We have reproduced the list below, explaining in each case what happened and whether we reported on it. Of the 78 incidents listed by the White House, we did not report only 12 of them - some were so minor they received barely any coverage elsewhere.

Just because the BBC covered an attack does not mean that incident was not under-reported, although it is unclear whether Mr Trump was referring to US or global news organisations. And some terrorist incidents do get more coverage than others, a point that has been hotly debated on social media.

Most of the atrocities listed by the White House were committed by Islamists, and the killing of nine black worshippers by a self-avowed white supremacist in South Carolina is notably absent.

Absent too is the 2016 bombing of a shopping centre in Baghdad that killed some 300 people, and last week's deadly assault on a mosque in Quebec City.
