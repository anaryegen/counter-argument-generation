There are few places left on the planet where the impact of people has not been felt. We have explored and left our footprint on nearly every corner of the globe. As our population and needs grow, we are leaving less and less room for wildlife.

Wildlife are under threat from many different kinds of human activities, from directly destroying habitat to spreading invasive species and disease. Most ecosystems are facing multiple threats. Each new threat puts additional stress on already weakened ecosystems and their wildlife.

Learn about some of greatest threats to the survival of wildlife in the U.S.

Habitat loss—due to destruction, fragmentation, or degradation of habitat—is the primary threat to the survival of wildlife in the United States.

Climate change is quickly becoming the biggest threat to the long-term survival of America’s wildlife.

Habitat loss, climate change, and a lack of biodiversity can all make ecosystems unhealthy, putting wildlife at greater risk for disease.

Every day the byproducts of our daily lives make their way via the air and water into the natural environment and become pollutants.

The impacts of invasive species on our natural ecosystems and economy cost billions of dollars each year. Many of our commercial, agricultural, and recreational activities depend on healthy native ecosystems.

Overexploitation is the over use of wildlife and plant species by people for food, clothing, pets, medicine, sport and many other purposes.
