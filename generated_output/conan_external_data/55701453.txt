During Ramadan, crimes committed by Muslim migrants decline by 11%.

Muslims commit differentially less crimes in Sha’ban, a month of self-reflection.

Religious practices induce changes in beliefs about criminal activity.

Muslims are not more likely to become victims during Ramadan.

Hate crimes against Muslims increase drastically during Eid al-Fitr.

Ramadan has attracted negative publicity and criticism in Western countries with large Muslim immigrant populations. Are these attitudes justified? Does the behavior of Muslim immigrants negatively affect host populations during this period? This paper investigates one important dimension of immigrant behavior that is a source of concern: criminal activity. Using the universe of criminal offenses registered by the Swiss police authorities, the paper documents that during Ramadan, crimes committed by Muslim migrants decline by 11%. The mechanism behind this reduction most consistent with the empirical results, is one of changes in beliefs and values of immigrants. Other explanations, such as time spent on community events and declining physical ability play only a minor role.
