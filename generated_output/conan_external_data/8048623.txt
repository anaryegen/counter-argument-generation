This study analyzes the relationship between three dimensions (economic, social, and political) of globalization and quality of life using a panel of 44 Islamic countries from 1970 to 2010. Using different estimation techniques, we find that overall globalization has a robust positive effect on quality of life, even when controlling for income, dependency ratio, literacy, number of physicians, and other factors. Nevertheless, the results do not hold for all forms of globalization. Economic and political forms of globalization tend to improve quality of life. In contrast, social globalization does not improve quality of life.
