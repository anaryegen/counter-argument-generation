If hadith stories agree with the Quran then accept it and learn from it.

If hadith stories do not agree with the Quran then reject it and also learn from it.

On the Day of Judgement Allaah judges by the words in the protected Quran.

On the Day of Judgement Allaah does not judge by the words in unprotected human hadith stories.

The Quran is the protected word of Allaah including the words and actions of Prophet Muhammad which are described and protected by Allaah.

Read what Allaah says in the Quran and beware of hadith stories which seek to add something that contradicts the teachings in the Quran.

Hadith which contradict the teachings of Allaah in the Quran are false hadith stories.

Be careful not to mix the words of Allaah with hadith stories which contradict the Quran.

Sahih Bukhari Book 9, Volume 89, Hadith 316.

Sahih al-Bukhari, 9:89:316

Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah

A Bedouin gave the Pledge of allegiance to Allaah's Apostle for Islam and the Bedouin got a fever where upon he said to the Prophet "Cancel my Pledge." But the Prophet refused. He came to him (again) saying, "Cancel my Pledge.' But the Prophet refused. Then (the Bedouin) left (Medina). Allaah's Apostle said: "Medina is like a pair of bellows (furnace): It expels its impurities and brightens and clears its good."

1a. Hadith 1 is confirmed by Quran 4:137 where Prophet Muhammad did not punish people for peacefully leaving religion instead Prophet Muhammad said what Allaah revealed in Quran 4:137 that humans have a life time to find their true belief because it is not until the time of natural death that the true belief of each human is shown.

Prophet Muhammad delivered the warning of punishment in the hereafter and did not order any punishment in this world for a person who left the religion two times in Quran 4:137.

Quran 4:137 Koran 4:137 Those who believed (in Allaah and) then disbelieved (in Allaah meaning for the first time they left Islam or they left Christianity or they left Judaism meaning for the first time they lost their belief in Allaah and), then again believed (in Allaah for a second time meaning they returned to Islam or Christianity or Judaism meaning for a second time they found their belief in Allaah and) then again disbelieved (in Allaah for a second time meaning they left Islam or Christianity or Judaism meaning for a second time they lost their belief in Allaah and) then increased in disbelief (in Allaah meaning they did not return to Islam or Christianity or Judaism meaning their belief in Allaah did not return to them before the time of their natural death), Allaah shall not forgive them (on the Day of Judgement) and will not guide them to the (right) way (of behaviour in this world).

1b. Hadith 1 is confirmed by Quran 2:256 where Prophet Muhammad did not punish people for peacefully leaving religion instead Prophet Muhammad said what Allaah revealed in Quran 2:256 that there is no compulsion in religion.

Quran 2:256 Koran 2:256 There is no compulsion in religion (meaning, religion must come voluntarily from the human heart and not from the fear of humans or by force) …”

1c. Hadith 1 is confirmed by Quran 18:29 where Prophet Muhammad did not punish people for peacefully leaving religion instead Prophet Muhammad said what Allaah revealed in Quran 18:29 “whoever wishes let them believe and whoever wishes let them disbelieve” and that punishment for disbelief comes from Allaah in the hereafter.

Quran 18:29 Koran 18:29 And say, “The truth (of the Quran) is from your Lord (Allaah)" so whoever wishes let them believe and whoever wishes let them disbelieve. We (Allaah) have prepared for the wrongdoers a Fire whose walls shall surround them (in the Hereafter). …”

1d. Hadith 1 is confirmed by Sunan an-Nasa'i 4046.

Not complete in its explanation.

Sunan an-Nasa'i 4046.

It was narrated that Ibn 'Abbas said,

“…Whoever kills, spreads mischief in the land, and wages war against Allaah and His Messenger, then joins the disbelievers before he can be caught, there is nothing to prevent the Hadd punishment being carried out on him because of what he did."

The punishment in Sunan an-Nasa'i 4046 is not for a person who peacefully changed religion but is for a person who “kills, spreads mischief in the land, and wages war against Allaah and His Messenger.”

In this world punishment is for “whoever kills, spreads mischief in the land, and wages war against Allaah and His Messenger.”

Peacefully leaving religion or changing religion is not a crime that has a punishment in this world.

Sunan an-Nasa'i 4046 does not mean people can be punishment without a trial.

In a criminal matter Prophet Muhammad asked the criminal to agree as to who should be their judge meaning no one can punish anyone without a proper trial.

The Quran requires that every person receive justice meaning a trial is necessary before any punishment.

Hadith stories claiming people can be killed without a trial are faulty because they contradict the Quran in justice.

1e. Hadith stories claiming people can be killed for peaceful disbelief or peacefully leaving religion or peacefully changing religion are faulty because they are opposite to what the Quran teaches which is that Allaah has given freedom of each person to find their true belief before the time of their natural death because that is the time when the true belief of each person is shown as taught by Allaah in Quran 2:256, Quran 3:159, Quran 4:137, Quran 5:54, Quran 10:99 – 10:100, Quran 18:29, Quran 28:54, Quran 50:45, Quran 88:21 - 88:26 and Quran 109:2 –109:6.

Punishment for disbelief is from Allaah in the hereafter and not from humans because only at the time of the natural death of each human is their true belief shown.

1f. Hadith 1 is confirmed by Musnad Ahmad 3720.

Confirmed by the Quran.

Abdullah ibn Mas’ud reported:

The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “The most restrained of the people regarding killing are the people of faith.”

Not confirmed by the Quran.

Sahih Bukhari Volume 9, Book 84, Number 57.

Sahih al-Bukhari Volume 9, Book 84, Hadith 57.

Sahih Bukhari 9:84:57

Some Zanadiqa (atheists) were brought to 'Ali and he burnt them. The news of this event, reached Ibn 'Abbas who said, "If I had been in his place, I would not have burnt them, as Allaah's Apostle forbade it, saying, 'Do not punish anybody with Allaah's punishment (fire).' I would have killed them according to the statement of Allaah's Apostle, 'Whoever changed his Islamic religion, then kill him.'"

Note 1. Sahih al-Bukhari Volume 4 Book 52 Hadith 260, Sahih Bukhari 4:52:260 is the same as above with the words “the Prophet said ‘If somebody (a Muslim) discards his religion, kill him.’”

2a. Hadith 2 claims Ali who lived in the time of Prophet Muhammad did not know that the one example of humans using fire to punish other humans in the Quran teaches that it transgresses the limits of acceptable human behaviour.

In Quran 85:4 – 85:10 Allaah teaches that when humans burn other humans with fire it transgresses the limits of acceptable human behaviour in this world.

Quran 85:4 Koran 85:4 Misfortune is on them (the Army of Yusuf As'ar Yath'ar) who tortured (the Christian believers of Allaah in Al-Ukhdood Yemen) in ditches (in 100 BH 524 CE 524 AD, 100 years before Islam in) –

Quran 85:5 Koran 85:5 (Ditches that contained) the fire full of fuel (fuel which were humans in the massacre of the Christian Najran martyrs that they were torturing by burning them alive).

Quran 85:6 Koran 85:6 When they (the Army of Yusuf As'ar Yath'ar) were sitting near it (the ditches).

Quran 85:7 Koran 85:7 And they (the Army of Yusuf As'ar Yath'ar) were witnesses to what they were doing against the (Christian) believers (of Allaah).

Quran 85:8 Koran 85:8 And they (the Army of Yusuf As'ar Yath'ar) resented them (the Christians in Al-Ukhdood the old city of Najran) only because they (the Christians) believed in Allaah, the mighty and the praiseworthy –

Quran 85:9 Koran 85:9 To whom belong the dominion of the heavens and the earth. Allaah is the witness to all things.

Quran 85:10 Koran 85:10 Those who have tortured (by burning alive) believing men and believing women and have not repented shall have the punishment of the burning fire in Hell Jahannam (in the hereafter).

2b. Hadith 2 claims Ali who lived in the time of Prophet Muhammad did not clearly know that Fire is the punishment of Allaah and no humans has been given permission to use this punishment.

2c. Hadith 2 claims that Ibn 'Abbas said Prophet Muhammad said “Whoever changed his Islamic religion, then kill him” however Prophet Muhammad only said what Allaah revealed in Quran 5:54 “whoever among you turns back (leaves) from his religion (allow them to leave), soon Allaah shall bring a people (to replace those who leave) whom He (Allaah) loves and who love Him (Allaah) …”

Quran 24:12 Koran 24:12 Why did not the believers (both) men and women when you heard it (the lie that Aishah the wife of Prophet Muhammad had committed illegal sexual intercourse with another man or in this example of the lies in hadith stories that Prophet Muhammad said 'whoever changed his Islamic religion then kill him” which contradicts the teaching of Allaah in Quran 2:256, Quran 3:159, Quran 4:137, Quran 5:54, Quran 10:99 – 10:100, Quran 18:29, Quran 28:54, Quran 50:45, Quran 88:21 - 88:26 and Quran 109:2 –109:6) think good about your own people and say, “This (hadith) is clearly a lie?”

Not confirmed by the Quran.

Sahih al-Bukhari Volume 9, Book 84, Hadith 59.

Sahih Bukhari 9:84:59

Narrated Abu Huraira:

When the Prophet died and Abu Bakr became his successor and some of the Arabs reverted to disbelief, 'Umar said, "O Abu Bakr! How can you fight these people although Allaah's Apostle said, 'I have been ordered to fight the people till they say: 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allaah, 'and whoever said, 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allaah', Allaah will save his property and his life from me, unless (he does something for which he receives legal punishment) justly, and his account will be with Allaah?' "Abu Bakr said, "By Allaah! I will fight whoever differentiates between prayers and Zakat as Zakat is the right to be taken from property (according to Allaah's Orders). By Allaah! If they refused to pay me even a kid they used to pay to Allaah's Apostle, I would fight with them for withholding it." 'Umar said, "By Allaah: It was nothing, but I noticed that Allaah opened Abu Bakr's chest towards the decision to fight, therefore I realized that his decision was right."

3a. Hadith 3 claims that the prophet said “I have been ordered to fight the people till they say: 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allaah” which is impossible because it contradicts Quran 2:256 “there is no compulsion in religion” and it contradicts Quran 5:54 “whoever among you turns back (leaves) from his religion (allow them to leave), soon Allaah shall bring a people (to replace those who leave) whom He (Allaah) loves and who love Him (Allaah) …”

3b. Hadith 3 claims that the prophet said “I have been ordered to fight the people till they say: 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allaah” which is impossible because no one is allowed to testify they believe in Allaah under force or from the fear of humans.

Sahih al-Bukhari Volume 9, Book 84, Hadith 58.

Sahih Bukhari 9:84:58

Abu Musa (Abdullah bin Qais) said, “… Behold: There was a fettered (chained) man beside Abu Musa. Mu'adh (Mu'adh bin Jabal) asked, "Who is this (man)?" Abu Musa said, "He was a Jew and became a Muslim and then reverted back to Judaism." Then Abu Musa requested Mu'adh to sit down but Mu'adh said, "I will not sit down till he has been killed. This is the judgment of Allaah and His Apostle (for such cases) and repeated it thrice. Then Abu Musa ordered that the man be killed, and he was killed. Abu Musa added, "Then we discussed the night prayers and one of us said, 'I pray and sleep, and I hope that Allaah will reward me for my sleep as well as for my prayers.'"

Note 1. Sahih al-Bukhari Volume 9 Book 89 Hadith 271, Sahih Bukhari 9:89:271 Narrated by Abu Musa is similar to the above.

4a. Hadith 4 has the problem that a man who knows nothing about a Jew who became Muslim and then returned to Judaism becomes angry and will not sit down until the Jew is killed claiming it is the judgement of Allaah and His prophet.

No judgement should be made without a trial or made in anger.

Sahih Bukhari Volume 9, Book 89, Hadith 272.

Sahih Bukhari 9:89:272

Volume 9, Book 89, Number 272

Narrated by 'Abdur Rahman bin Abi Bakra

Abu Bakra wrote to his son who was in Sijistan: 'Do not judge between two persons when you are angry, for I heard the Prophet saying, "A judge should not judge between two persons while he is in an angry mood."

4b. The claim that killing someone only because he changed his religion is the judgement of Allaah and the prophet is opposite to what Allaah revealed and what Prophet Muhammad recited to the people in Quran 2:256, Quran 3:159, Quran 4:137, Quran 5:54, Quran 10:99 – 10:100, Quran 18:29, Quran 28:54, Quran 50:45, Quran 88:21 - 88:26 and Quran 109:2 –109:6

Sahih al-Bukhari Volume 9, Book 83, Hadith 17.

Sahih Bukhari 9:89:272

Narrated by 'Abdullah

Allaah's Apostle said, "The blood of a Muslim who confesses that none has the right to be worshipped but Allaah and that I am His Apostle, cannot be shed except in three cases: In Qisas for murder, a married person who commits illegal sexual intercourse and the one who reverts from Islam (apostate) and leaves the Muslims."

5a. The claim that killing someone only because they peacefully leave religion is opposite to what Allaah revealed and what Prophet Muhammad recited to the people in Quran 2:256, Quran 3:159, Quran 4:137, Quran 5:54, Quran 10:99 – 10:100, Quran 18:29, Quran 28:54, Quran 50:45, Quran 88:21 - 88:26 and Quran 109:2 –109:6 because no human knows another humans true belief until the time of their natural death and for this reason only Allaah is the judge of belief in the hereafter on the Day of Judgement.

B. Did Prophet Muhammad say "whoever changed his Islamic religion then kill him" according to the Quran?

A. Test the hadith story with the Quran.

This story is not in the protected Quran which comes from Allaah and contain the verses which Prophet Muhammad recited to the people.

This story comes from the unprotected hadith stories passed from one human to another human.

What does Allaah teach in the Quran about changing religion?

1. Quran 5:54 says Muslims can leave Islam if that is the will of Allaah meaning all hadith stories which claim Prophet Muhammad said “whoever changed his Islamic religion then kill him” were invented after the death of Prophet Muhammad.

Quran 5:54 Koran 5:54 O you who believe (in Allaah), whoever among you turns back (leaves) from his religion (allow them to leave), soon Allaah shall bring a people (to replace those who leave) whom He (Allaah) loves and who love Him (Allaah) and (they shall be) humble toward those with faith (in Allaah) and stern (by standing up for their rights) toward those without faith (in Allaah), striving in the way of Allaah and without fear of anyone who may criticize them (for their faith in Allaah). This is the grace that Allaah gives to whomever He (Allaah) wills. Allaah encompasses all (the things in our life) and (Allaah) knows all things.

Note 1. Prophet Muhammad did not punish people for peacefully leaving religion instead Prophet Muhammad said what Allaah revealed in Quran 5:54 that “whoever leaves religion will be replaced by people whom Allaah loves and who love Allaah.”

2. Quran 4:137 says every human can change their religion until the time of their natural death meaning all hadith stories which claim Prophet Muhammad said “whoever changed his Islamic religion then kill him” were invented after the death of Prophet Muhammad.

Quran 4:137 explains that the purpose of life is to find your true belief which would be impossible if humans were forced to stay in a religion in which they did not believe.

Allaah does not force people to stay in one religion against their belief and against their will because the purpose of life is for every human to find their true belief before the time of their natural death as explained in Quran 4:137.

Quran 4:137 Koran 4:137 Those who believed (in Allaah and) then disbelieved (in Allaah meaning for the first time they left Islam or they left Christianity or they left Judaism meaning for the first time they lost their belief in Allaah and), then again believed (in Allaah for a second time meaning they returned to Islam or Christianity or Judaism meaning for a second time they found their belief in Allaah and) then again disbelieved (in Allaah for a second time meaning they left Islam or Christianity or Judaism meaning for a second time they lost their belief in Allaah and) then increased in disbelief (in Allaah meaning they did not return to Islam or Christianity or Judaism meaning their belief in Allaah did not return to them before the time of their natural death), Allaah shall not forgive them (on the Day of Judgement) and will not guide them to the (right) way (of behaviour in this world).

Note 1. Prophet Muhammad did not punish people for peacefully leaving religion instead Prophet Muhammad said what Allaah revealed in Quran 4:137 that humans have a life time to find their true belief because it is not until the time of natural death that the true belief of each human is shown.

In the first part of Quran 5:48 Allaah gave Prophet Muhammad authority to deliver the message to all the religions of Allaah including Islam and Christianity and Judaism.

Quran 5:48 Koran 5:48 And to you (Prophet Muhammad) We (Allaah) revealed the Scripture (the Quran) with the truth that confirmed the Scripture that was before it (in the Gospel Injil and the Torah Taurat) and (for you Prophet Muhammad to be) a guardian over it (the Quran). So judge between them (the Jews, the Christians and the Muslims) by what Allaah has revealed (to you Prophet Muhammad) and do not let their desires move you away from the truth that has come to you. …”

In the second part of Quran 5:48 Allaah explains why Allaah has given each religion of Allaah its own laws and its own Book meaning Allaah is protecting the Books of the Muslims and the Christians and the Jews as proof Allaah is real until the Day of Judgement.

Quran 5:48 Koran 5:48 “…. For each (community of Jews, Christians and Muslims) We (Allaah) have appointed a divine law and a way (of religion). If Allaah willed He (Allaah) could have made you (the Jews, the Christians and the Muslims) one community. But He (Allaah) tests you (the Jews, the Christians and the Muslims) by what He (Allaah) has given you (in the Torah Taurat and the Gospel Injil and the Koran Quran to show who is best in behaviour). So strive for all that is good. To Allaah you shall all return and He (Allaah) shall then inform you (in the Hereafter) about (the correctness of) the religious matters in which you (the Jews, the Christians and the Muslims) argue among each other.

Note 1. Prophet Muhammad did not punish people for peacefully leaving religion instead Prophet Muhammad said what Allaah revealed in Quran 5:48 that no one can believe unless it is the will of Allaah and to Allaah everyone will return for judgement.

Only when there are no threats from humans can a human find their true belief meaning Allaah has ordered freedom for humans to find their true belief before their natural death as explained in Quran 4:137 in 2 above.

Quran 2:62 Koran 2:62 (In the hereafter) truly those (Muslims) who believed and those who became Jews, Christians and Sabians, whoever believed in Allaah and the Last Day (The Day of Resurrection) and did good deeds, they shall have their reward from their Lord, and they shall not fear or grieve (and this is confirmed in Quran 6:158 for those in the hereafter who “believed” and did good deeds. Quran 5:69 repeats Quran 2:62 meaning stop and think about what Allaah is saying in these verses confirming what is in the Hebrew Bible and the Gospel Injil of the promise of Paradise Jannah from Allaah in the books of Allaah on the Day of Resurrection and Judgement for those who “believed” and did good deeds. The Quran brings the same truth which Allaah brought to the Jewish people in the Hebrew Bible and to the Christian people in the Gospel Injil of Jesus Isa by Mark, Matthew, Luke and John. The Quran is a confirmer of what came before it in the same way as the Gospel Injil is a confirmer of what came before it meaning the Books of Allaah confirm each other as proof Allaah is real and as proof His promise is real as explained in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQ3o3ybc-KA showing that without His permission no one can change His words in His Books which are with all humans today and until the Day of Judgement so that you can believe Allaah is real and His promise is real).

Note 1. The Jews who believed in Allaah and did good deeds go to Paradise Jannah.

Note 2. The Christians who believed in Allaah and did good deeds go to Paradise Jannah.

Note 3. The Sabians who believed in Allaah and did good deeds go to Paradise Jannah.

Note 4. The Muslims who believed in Allaah and did good deeds go to Paradise Jannah.

Note 5. Everyone who believed in Allaah and did good deeds goes to Paradise Jannah.

Note 6. This revelation is so important that Allaah has repeated it in Quran 5:69

In Quran 2:62 and Quran 5:69 the promise of Paradise Jannah is not for those who “believe” but only for those who “believed” meaning who died (past tense) because it is not until the time of death that your true belief or disbelief and your good and evil deeds are judged,

Allaah repeated Quran 2:62 and Quran 5:69 two times because it is only with Quran 2:62 and Quran 5:69 that there are no contradictions within the Quran and between the Quran and the Torah Taurat and between the Quran and the Gospel Injil as proof in Quran 4:82 to the Jews in the time of Prophet Muhammad who are promised Paradise Jannah in Quran 3:113-3:115 and to the Christians in the time of Prophet Muhammad who are promised Paradise Jannah in Quran 5:82-5:85 and to the stone idol worshippers 1400 years ago who are not promised Paradise Jannah in Quran 3:85 and to all people today and in the future that the Quran is from Allaah because the Quran contains no contradictions.

If Quran 2:62 and Quran 5:69 did not exist then it would be proof that the Quran was not from Allaah because without Quran 2:62 and Quran 5:69 the Quran would contradict its self and contradict the Torah Taurat and contradict the Gospel Injil.

Quran 2:62 and Quran 5:69 is good news for Jews, Christians, Sabians, Muslims and all the people in the world confirming they will all come together again in a life after death.

In Quran 4:123 the desires of Jews and Christians and Muslims is not a concern of Allaah because Allaah created every religion and gave each religion their laws and their Book and every person in every religion will be judged fairly in the hereafter meaning Allaah orders freedom for humans to find their true belief until their natural death as explained in Quran 4:137 in 2 above.

Quran 4:123 Koran 4:123 (Entry to Paradise Jannah) shall not be based on your (the Muslim's) desires or on the desires of the people of the Scripture (the Jews and the Christians). (Instead) whoever does wrong (on the earth) shall earn (the punishment for the wrong) and that person shall not find any protector or helper other than Allaah (in the hereafter).

Note 1. Prophet Muhammad did not punish people for peacefully leaving religion instead Prophet Muhammad said what Allaah revealed in Quran 4:123 that to Allaah everyone will return for judgement.

3. Quran 10:99 – 10:100 explains that Allaah has no interest in forcing people to stay in a religion in which they do not believe because the purpose of life is for each human to find their true belief before the time of their natural death meaning all hadith stories which claim Prophet Muhammad said “whoever changed his Islamic religion then kill him” were invented after the death of Prophet Muhammad.

Quran 10:99 Koran 10:99 And if your Lord (Allaah) had willed then all who are on the earth would have all believed together. (Allaah asks Prophet Muhammad), “Would you force people (against their will) to believe (in Allaah when it is Allaah who decrees who will believe and who will disbelieve)? (The answer is no, Islam does not force belief in Allaah because -).”

Quran 10:100 Koran 10:100 It is not for any soul to believe except by the permission of Allaah and He (Allaah) will place the anger (of Allaah in the hereafter) on those who do not use reason (to follow good behaviour).

Note 1. Prophet Muhammad did not punish people for peacefully leaving religion instead Prophet Muhammad said what Allaah revealed in Quran 10:99 – 10:100 that no one can believe unless it is the will of Allaah and it is not for humans to force a person to believe if they disbelieve.

4. In Quran 109:2 – Quran 109:6 Allaah teaches respect towards people who have different religions.

Quran 109:2 Koran 109:2 “I do not worship what you (the stone idol worshippers in Makkah) worship (that are stone idols).”

Quran 109:3 Koran 109:3 “Nor do you (the stone idol worshippers in Makkah) worship what I worship (that is Allaah).”

Quran 109:4 Koran 109:4 “And I shall not worship what you worship (that are stone idols).”

Quran 109:5 Koran 109:5 “Nor shall you worship what I worship (that is Allaah).”

Quran 109:6 Koran 109:6 “For you is your way (of religion, of belief) and for me is my way (of religion, of belief).”

Note 1. Prophet Muhammad did not punish people for peacefully leaving religion instead Prophet Muhammad said what Allaah revealed in Quran 109:2 – Quran 109:6 that no one can believe unless it is the will of Allaah and that people with different beliefs must be respected as you would like them to respect your belief in Allaah.

5. Belief in Allaah must not come from fearing humans because that is a false belief.

The only true belief in Allaah comes from the heart and not from the fear of humans meaning all hadith stories which claim Prophet Muhammad said “whoever changed his Islamic religion then kill him” were invented after the death of Prophet Muhammad.

Quran 2:40 Koran 2:40 “… fear no one except Me (Allaah).”

Quran 2:150 Koran 2:150 “… So do not fear them (humans) but fear Me (Allaah) so that I (Allaah) may complete My (Allaah’s) blessings on you and that you may walk on the right path.

Quran 2:155 Koran 2:155 “And We (Allaah) shall test you with some fear …”

Quran 3:173 Koran 3:173 Those to whom the people said, "the people have gathered against you so fear them" instead increased the faith of the faithful and they said, "Allaah (alone) is all we need and He (Allaah) is our best protector."

Quran 2:189 Koran 2:189 “… righteous (is the person) who fears Allaah.”

Quran 3:175 Koran 3:175 It is only Satan Shaitan that suggests that you fear his supporters, so do not fear them but fear Me (Allaah), if you have (true) faith (in Allaah).

Quran 4:77 Koran 4:77 “… then suddenly some of them feared humans as they feared Allaah or even feared humans more than they feared Allaah …. The Hereafter is much better for those who fear Allaah …”

Quran 5:3 Koran 5:3 “… Today those without faith have despair of (not being able to destroy) your religion, so do not fear them (humans) but fear Me (Allaah) instead …”

Quran 5:44 Koran 5:44 “… So do not fear humans but fear Me (Allaah) … Whoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed is a disbeliever in Allaah.”

Quran 5:54 Koran 5:54 O you who believe (in Allaah), Whoever among you turns back (leaves) from his religion (allow them to leave), soon Allaah shall bring a people (to replace those who leave) whom He (Allaah) loves and who love Him (Allaah) and (they shall be) humble toward those with faith (in Allaah) and stern (by standing up for their rights) toward those without faith (in Allaah), striving in the way of Allaah and without fear of anyone who may criticize them (for their faith in Allaah). This is the grace that Allaah gives to whomever He (Allaah) wills. Allaah encompasses all (the things in our life) and (Allaah) knows all things.

Quran 9:13 Koran 9:13 “… Surely Allaah has more right that you should fear Him (Allaah), if you are (true) believers (in Allaah).”

Quran 12:57 Koran 12:57 “… And the reward of the Hereafter is better for those who believe and who used to fear Allaah.

Quran 16:50 Koran 16:50 They (who believe in Allaah) fear their Lord (Allaah) above them (humans) and they do what they are commanded.

Quran 16:52 Koran 16:52 To Him (Allaah) belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth and to Him (Allaah) is due constant worship. Shall you then fear anyone other than Allaah?

Note 1. Prophet Muhammad did not punish people for peacefully leaving religion instead Prophet Muhammad said what Allaah revealed above where belief must come from the fear and love of Allaah and not from the fear of humans and threats from humans.

6. Islam and Judaism and Christianity all worship Allaah.

Quran 3:113 Koran 3:113 Not all of them (the Jews of Yathrib Arabia later Medina Arabia today Madinah Saudi Arabia) are the same, some of the people of the Scripture (the Jews of Yathrib) stand for what is right (correct) and they recite the revelations of Allaah during the hours of the night prostrating themselves in prayer (to Allaah).

Quran 3:114 Koran 3:114 Those (Jews of Yathrib) believe in Allaah and the Last Day and they do what is right and forbid what is wrong and they are quick to do good deeds and they are among the righteous.

Quran 3:115 Koran 3:115 And whatever good they (the Jews of Yathrib) do, it shall be accepted and Allaah knows very well who are the righteous (among the Jews of Yathrib).

Note 1. The righteous among the Jews were promised Paradise Jannah in the time of Prophet Muhammad and this promise would apply to the righteous among Jews worldwide.

Quran 5:82 Koran 5:82 "... And you shall find that those who say, “We are Christians” have the most affection to the believers (of Allaah, the Muslims in Yathrib Arabia). That is because the priests and monks are not proud (meaning they love Allaah more than they love their pride).

Quran 5:83 Koran 5:83 When they (the Christian priests and monks) listen to what has been revealed to the messenger (Prophet Muhammad), you shall see their eyes overflow with tears because they recognise it is the truth (from Allaah). They say, “Our Lord (Allaah), we believe, so write us as among the witnesses (that recognize the truth from Allaah).”

Quran 5:84 Koran 5:84 Why should we (Christian priests and monks) not have faith in Allaah and in the truth that has come to us since we hope that our Lord (Allaah) shall admit us (to paradise) with the righteous people?

Quran 5:85 Koran 5:85 For what they (the Christian priests and monks) said they are rewarded with gardens with rivers flowing underneath (in Paradise) where they shall live forever. That is the reward for those (people) that do good.

Note 1. The righteous among the Christians were promised Paradise Jannah in the time of Prophet Muhammad and this promise would apply to the righteous among the Christians worldwide.

The good news from Allaah for Jews and Christians delivered 1400 years ago by Prophet Muhammad.

1. Jews and Christians who follow their Book and also believe the Quran shall receive a double reward in the hereafter in Quran 28:54, Quran 34:37 and Quran 57:28.

2. Jews who follow the Tanakh Jewish scripture and believe the Quran are correctly observing the Torah Taurat.

3. Christians who follow the Gospels and believe the Quran are correctly observing the Gospel Injil.

4. Muslims who follow the Quran so that it agrees with the Tanakh Jewish scripture and the Gospel Injil are correctly observing the Quran.

Quran 28:53 Koran 28:53 And when it (the Quran) is recited to them (the Jews who truly believe the Torah Taurat and the Christians who truly believe the Gospel Injil), they (those Jews and Christians) say, “We believe in it (the Koran Quran). It is the truth from our Lord (Allaah). Even before it (the Quran was revealed to us) we were of those (Jews and Christians) who submitted (to Allaah. The English word submitter is the Arabic word Muslim. Islam the religion means submission and Muslim the believer means submitter. Submitter and submission for the Muslim people is in Quran 47:19 “…there is no Allaah except Allaah …” and submitter and submission for the Jewish people is in Torah Exodus 20:2 “.... You shall have no other gods before Me Allaah” and submitter and submission for the Christian people is in the Gospel of Jesus Isa by Luke 4:8 “… You shall worship the Lord your Allaah, and him only shall you serve” meaning Allaah inspired the same belief of Islam which is an Arabic word meaning submission, to Allaah in Judaism, Christianity, Islam and in others). - (Continued in Quran 28:54).

Note 1. The Quran confirms the Torah Taurat and explains the story of Jesus in the Gospel of Mark, Matthew, Luke and John.

Quran 28:54 Koran 28:54 They (the Jews who truly believe the Torah Taurat and the Christians who truly believe the Gospel Injil and also believe the Quran) shall be given their reward twice (in Quran 28:54 meaning twofold in Quran 34:37 meaning double in Quran 57:28) because they are steadfast (in their belief in Allaah) and they repel evil with good (deeds) and they spend (in charity) from what We (Allaah) have provided to them. (Jews and Christians who follow their Book in Quran 5:68 and also believe the Quran will receive a double reward in the hereafter in Quran 28:54, Quran 34:37 and Quran 57:28 meaning the reward for every good deed they do will be doubled because they believed the Quran which tells the Jewish people to follow the Torah Taurat which is their eternal covenant between Allaah and the Hebrew people forever and tells the Christian people to follow the Gospel Injil which is explained in the Quran and tells the Muslim people to follow the Quran in Quran 2:40, Quran 2:41, Quran 2:62, Quran 2:106, Quran 3:93, Quran 4:123, Quran 5:43, Quran 5:47, Quran 5:48, Quran 5:69 and Quran 13:39).

Note 1. Jews and Christians who follow their book and also believe the Quran will receive their reward twice in the Hereafter.

Quran 34:37 Koran 34:37 – It is not your wealth or your children that shall bring you close to Us (Allaah), but the person who believes and does good (deeds). Theirs shall be a twofold reward (twice in Quran 28:54, twofold in Quran 34:37 and double in Quran 57:28) for what they (the Jews like Quran 3:113 - 3:115 and the Christians like Quran 5:82 - 5:85 who follow their Book in Quran 5:68 and also believe the Quran) did (because they believed the Quran which tells the Jewish people to follow the Torah Taurat which is their eternal covenant between Allaah and the Hebrew people forever and tells the Christian people to follow the Gospel Injil which is explained in the Quran and tells the Muslim people to follow the Quran is confirmed in Quran 2:40, Quran 2:41, Quran 2:62, Quran 2:106, Quran 3:93, Quran 4:123, Quran 5:43, Quran 5:47, Quran 5:48, Quran 5:69 and Quran 13:39) and they (those Jews and Christians) shall live secure in the high dwellings (in Paradise Jannah).- (Continued in Quran 34:38).

Note 1. Jews and Christians who follow their Book and also believe the Quran will be given a twofold reward in the hereafter.

Quran 34:38 Koran 34:38 (Jews and Christians who followed their Book and also believed the Quran will receive their reward twice in Quran 28:54, twofold in Quran 34:37 and double in Quran 57:28 in the hereafter however) Those (Jews and the Christians who did not believe the Quran for example if Jews did not correctly observe the Torah Taurat by keeping the Sabbath Day which is their everlasting covenant with Allaah in every generation forever or if Christians did not correctly observe the Gospel Injil where Prophet Jesus said he is not Allaah "Allaah is my Allaah and your Allaah" meaning Allaah is my Lord and your Lord and "Allaah is my Father and your Father" meaning Allaah is my Creator and your Creator in Gospel of John 20:17 and) who strive against Our (Allaah’s) revelations by trying to make them (Allaah’s revelations) to fail (for example Jesus is the son of Allaah means Jesus is the servant of Allaah delivering the message of Allaah so his mention with angels in Gospel of Mark 13:32 and Gospel of Matthew 24:36 means that angel messengers of Allaah and human messengers of Allaah both do not know the hour meaning do not confuse angel and human messengers with Allaah because only Allaah knows the hour but His angel and human messengers like Jesus and Moses and angels do not know the hour meaning pray only to Allaah and not to the angel and human messengers of Allaah because those who do), they shall be brought to the punishment (of Hell Jahannam in the Hereafter).

Quran 57:28 Koran 57:28 All you (the Jews and the Christians in Quran 57:27 and Quran 57:29) that believe, Fear Allaah and believe in His (Allaah’s) messenger and He (Allaah) shall give you a double portion of His (Allaah’s) mercy and provide for you a Light (of righteous knowledge meaning Jews who follow the Tanakh Jewish scripture and believe the Quran are correctly observing the Torah Taurat and meaning Christians who follow the Gospel and believe the Quran are correctly observing the Gospel Injil and Muslims who follow the Quran so that it agrees with the Tanakh Jewish scripture and the Gospel Injil are correctly observing the warning from Allaah in Quran 4:136 that whoever has no faith in Allaah’s Books has strayed far away from Allaah because the Books of Allaah are the light) by which you shall walk (on the correct path in Quran 2:40 - 2:41, Quran 4:136 and Quran 28:48 - 28:49) and (in the hereafter) He (Allaah) shall forgive you (of your past sins). Allaah is forgiving and merciful. (Jews like Quran 3:113 - 3:115 and Christians like Quran 5:82 - 5:85 who follow their Book in Quran 5:68 and also believe the Quran will receive their reward twice in Quran 28:54, twofold in Quran 34:37 and double in Quran 57:28 in the hereafter meaning the reward for every good deed they do will be doubled because they believed the Quran which tells the Jewish people to follow the Torah Taurat which is their eternal covenant between Allaah and the Hebrew people forever and tells the Christian people to follow the Gospel Injil which is explained in the Quran and tells the Muslim people to follow the Quran is confirmed in Quran 2:40, Quran 2:41, Quran 2:62, Quran 2:106, Quran 3:93, Quran 4:123, Quran 5:43, Quran 5:47, Quran 5:48, Quran 5:69 and Quran 13:39). - (Continued in Quran 57:29).

Note 1. Jews and Christians who follow their Book and also believe the Quran will be given a double reward in the hereafter.

Quran 57:29 Koran 57:29 (Jews and Christians who followed their Book and also believed the Quran will receive their reward twice in Quran 28:54, twofold in Quran 34:37 and double in Quran 57:28 in the hereafter) so that the people of the Book (the Jews and the Christians who did not believe the Quran for example if Jews did not correctly observe the Torah Taurat by keeping the Sabbath Day which is their everlasting covenant with Allaah in every generation forever or if Christians did not correctly observe the Gospel Injil where Prophet Jesus said he is not Allaah "Allaah is my Allaah and your Allaah" meaning Allaah is my Lord and your Lord and "Allaah is my Father and your Father" meaning Allaah is my Creator and your Creator in Gospel of John 20:17 and that Jesus is the son of Allaah means Jesus is the servant of Allaah delivering the message of Allaah so his mention with angels in Gospel of Mark 13:32 and Gospel of Matthew 24:36 means that angel messengers of Allaah and human messengers of Allaah both do not know the hour meaning do not confuse angel and human messengers with Allaah because only Allaah knows the hour but His angel and human messengers like Jesus and Moses and angels do not know the hour meaning pray only to Allaah and not to the angel and human messengers of Allaah because those who do) may know (in the hereafter) that they do not have power over anything from the bounty of Allaah and that (all) the bounty is in Allaah’s hand. He gives it (Allaah's bounty) to whom He (Allaah) wills. And Allaah is the possessor of the great bounty (of Paradise Jannah).

Quran 4:40 Koran 4:40 Allaah is not unjust not even as much as the weight of an atom (to people such as Jews and Christians and Muslims and all others). When any good (deed is done) He (Allaah) doubles it (meaning Allaah doubles the value of your good deeds) and He (Allaah) gives a great reward (of Paradise Jannah in the hereafter).

Note 1. The good news from Allaah for Muslims delivered 1400 years ago by Prophet Muhammad in Quran 2:265, Quran 4:40 and Quran 33:31 is that the reward to Muslims for doing good deeds is also doubled in the hereafter meaning the reward for every good deed they do in this world will be doubled in the hereafter.

Quran 42:15 Koran 42:15 So (Prophet Muhammad) invite (the people to Allaah), and stay on the correct path as you (Prophet Muhammad) are commanded and do not follow their (the peoples) desires (concerning religion) but say, "I believe what Allaah has sent down of the Book (in the Quran and in the Torah Taurat in Quran 2:41, Quran 3:3, Quran 3:93, Quran 5:43, Quran 5:44, Quran 5:68, Quran 20:133 and in the Gospel Injil in Quran 3:3, Quran 5:47, Quran 5:68 and Quran 20:133) and I am commanded that I do justice between you (the Jews, Christians and Muslims). Allaah is our Lord and your Lord (meaning Allaah is the Lord of the Muslims and the Lord of the Jews and the Christians). For us (Muslims is the responsibility for) our deeds and for you (Jews and Christians is the responsibility for) your deeds. There is no argument between us (Muslims) and between you (the Jews and the Christians because Allaah has revealed the same message to all of us to worship Allaah who created you and do good in the world and reject evil in the world). Allaah shall bring us (Muslims and Christians and Jews and all humankind) together and to Him (Allaah) is the final destination (in the hereafter in Quran 2:62, Quran 3:64, Quran 4:123, Quran 5:48 and Quran 5:69).”

Note 1. There is no argument between Muslims and Jews and Christians because the Tanakh Jewish scripture and the Gospel Injil and the Quran contain the same message to worship Allaah and strive for all that is good.

Quran 28:51 Koran 28:51 And We (Allaah) have made the Word (of Allaah in the Quran) to reach them (the stone idol worshippers of Makkah Arabia) so that they might be reminded (of Allaah, their creator).

Quran 28:48 Koran 28:48 But when the truth came to them (the stone idol worshippers of Makkah Arabia) from Us (Allaah), they said, “Why is he (Prophet Muhammad M Mim م M-uhammad م-uhammad) not given (signs) like what was given to Prophet Moses Musa (represented by Mount Sinai S’ Sin س Sin-ai س-ai)? But did they (the stone idol worshippers of Makkah Arabia) not disbelieve in what was given to Prophet Moses Musa in the past? (Because) they say, “(They are both only books about magic) two magic (books the Torah Taurat T Ta ط Ta-urat ط-urat given by Allaah to Prophet Moses Musa and the Quran Q Qaf ق Qaf-uran ق-uran given by Allaah to Prophet Muhammad) supporting each other” and they (the stone idol worshippers of Makkah Arabia) say, “In all (that is in the Torah Taurat and the Quran) we do not believe.”

Quran 28:49 Koran 28:49 Say (Prophet Muhammad to the stone idol worshippers of Makkah Arabia), “Then bring a Book from Allaah that gives better guidance than these two (the Torah Taurat and the Quran) so that I (Prophet Muhammad) may follow it, if you are telling the truth.”

Note 1. The best guidance is the Quran and the Torah Taurat meaning both are correctly understood when they confirm and explain each other.

Quran 3:199 Koran 3:199 And there are among the people of the Scripture (the Jews and the Christians) those who believe in Allaah and in that which has been revealed to you (Prophet Muhammad in the Quran) and revealed to them (in the Torah Taurat and in the Gospel Injil), (they) humble themselves to Allaah. They do not trade away (abandon) the revelations of Allaah for a little gain (by wrongly using the revelations of Allaah to increase their pride or arrogance), for them is a reward with their Lord. Allaah is quick to account (for what you do).

Note 1. The Quran confirms the Tanakh Jewish scripture is correct and explains the story of Prophet Jesus Isa in the Gospel of Mark, Matthew, Luke and John.

7. Prophet Muhammad is not a controller of people he is only a warner.

Quran 88:21 - Quran 88:26 shows that Allaah makes humans afraid of Allaah with punishment in the hereafter and confirms that Prophet Muhammad is not a controller of humans but only a warner to humans meaning all hadith stories which claim Prophet Muhammad said “whoever changed his Islamic religion then kill him” were invented after the death of Prophet Muhammad.

The only true belief in Allaah is belief which comes from the heart and not from the fear of humans meaning all hadith stories which claim Prophet Muhammad said “whoever changed his Islamic religion then kill him” were invented after the death of Prophet Muhammad because such a statement seeks to control humans by making humans afraid not of Allaah but afraid of humans who threaten to kill humans showing that all such hadith stories were invented by humans who wanted to control humans by making humans afraid of humans.

Quran 88:21 Koran 88:21 So remind them (of Allaah who is their creator); you (Prophet Muhammad) are only a reminder (meaning, a messenger from Allaah).

Quran 88:22 Koran 88:22 You (Prophet Muhammad) do not control them.

Note 1. The controller of the creation is Allaah who is the creator of the creation.

Note 2. Only Allaah determines who will believe and who will disbelieve in Quran 10:99 – 10:100 in 3 above.

Note 3. Only Allaah determines when people will believe and when people will disbelieve in Quran 4:137 in 2 above.

Note 4. Allaah allows humans to leave or change their religion in Quran 5:54 in 1 above,

Note 5. Allaah has decreed freedom to join or not to join religion in Quran 2:256 in 9 below.

Note 6. Allaah has decreed freedom to leave religion or to change religion in Quran 5:54 in 1 above.

Note 7. Allaah has decreed freedom to believe or to disbelieve until the time natural death comes to a human in Quran 4:137 in 2 above.

Note 8. Quran 2:256 Allaah says there is no compulsion in religion meaning Allaah gives every human thefreedom to join or not to join religion and the freedom to change religion and this is confirmed in notes 1 – 7.

Note 9. Prophet Muhammad did not punish people for peacefully leaving religion instead Prophet Muhammad said what Allaah revealed in Quran 88:22 that Prophet Muhammad does not control a person meaning the punishment for disbelief comes in the hereafter from Allaah who is the judge of belief.

Quran 88:23 Koran 88:23 But whoever turns away (from the word of Allaah) and disbelieves.

Quran 88:24 Koran 88:24 Then Allaah shall greatly punish them (in the hereafter).

Note 1. Punishment for disbelief comes from Allaah in the hereafter and not from humans in this world because Allaah gives every human their life until their natural death to find their true belief.

Quran 88:25 Koran 88:25 To Us (Allaah) they shall return (in the hereafter).

Quran 88:26 Koran 88:26 Then to Us (Allaah) they shall account (for what they did in their life).

Note 1. Punishment for disbelief comes from Allaah in the hereafter and not from humans in this world because Allaah gives every human their life until their natural death to find their true belief.

8. Prophet Muhammad is not a compeller of people he is only a warner.

Prophet Muhammad is not a person to compel people to believe in Allaah because no one can believe in Allaah without the permission of Allaah as explained in Quran 10:99 – 10:100 in 3 above.

A person who says “anyone who leaves their Islamic religion must be killed” is compelling people to believe in Allaah meaning all hadith stories which claim Prophet Muhammad said “whoever changed his Islamic religion then kill him” were invented after the death of Prophet Muhammad.

Quran 50:45 Koran 50:45 We (Allaah) are best aware of what they (the stone idol worshippers in Makkah Arabia) say (about resurrection) and you (Prophet Muhammad) are not over them the one to compel (people to believe in Allaah and the resurrection of the dead back to life in the hereafter). But remind with the Quran whoever fears My (Allaah’s) threat (of punishment for evil doers and reward for righteousness in the hereafter).

Note 1. Prophet Muhammad did not punish people for peacefully leaving religion instead Prophet Muhammad said what Allaah revealed in Quran 50:45 that Prophet Muhammad is not a compeller who forces people to believe but only a warner meaning the punishment for disbelief comes in the hereafter from Allaah who is the judge of belief.

9. In Islam there is “no compulsion in religion” because every human in the world is given life until the time of their natural death to find their true belief meaning all hadith stories which claim Prophet Muhammad said “whoever changed his Islamic religion then kill him” were invented after the death of Prophet Muhammad.

Quran 2:256 Koran 2:256 There is no compulsion in religion (meaning, religion must come voluntarily from the human heart and not from the fear of humans or by force) …”

Quran 18:29 Koran 18:29 And say, “The truth (of the Quran) is from your Lord (Allaah)" sowhoever wishes let them believe and whoever wishes let them disbelieve. We (Allaah) have prepared for the wrongdoers a Fire whose walls shall surround them (in the Hereafter). …”

Note 1. Prophet Muhammad did not punish people for peacefully leaving religion instead Prophet Muhammad said what Allaah revealed in Quran 2:256 that there is no compulsion in religion and in Quran 18:29 whoever wishes let them believe and whoever wishes let them disbelieve and that punishment for disbelief comes from Allaah in the hereafter not from humans in this world.

10. Allaah did not tell Prophet Muhammad to threaten to kill the people who might have wanted to leave Islam in Quran 3:159.

Quran 3:159 Koran 3:159 So because of the mercy of Allaah you (Prophet Muhammad) dealt gently with them (who disobeyed your orders at the battle of Uhud), If you (Prophet Muhammad) had been rude and harsh in your heart then surely they would have dispersed from around you (and abandoned the religion of Allaah but they did not do that because of the goodness Allaah has put in your heart which is an excellent example to them of the religion of Allaah). So pardon them (for having left their positions in the battlefield to collect war booty) and ask forgiveness (from Allaah) for them and consult with them about the matter (which occurred at the battle of Uhud). Then when you have (all) decided the matter then put your trust in Allaah. Allaah loves those who put their trust (in Allaah).

Note 1. In Quran 3:159 Allaah did not tell Prophet Muhammad to threaten to kill the people who might have wanted to leave Islam because in Quran 5:54 in 1 above Allaah says Muslims can leave Islam if that is the will of Allaah.

Note 2. In Quran 3:159 Allaah did not tell Prophet Muhammad to threaten to kill the people who might have wanted to leave Islam because in Quran 4:137 in 2 above Allaah says every human can change their religion until the time of their natural death.

Note 3. In Quran 3:159 Allaah did not tell Prophet Muhammad to threaten to kill the people who might have wanted to leave Islam because in Quran 10:99 – 10:100 in 3 above Allaah has no interest in forcing people to stay in a religion in which they do not believe because the purpose of life is for each human to find their true belief before the time of their natural death.

Note 4. In Quran 3:159 Allaah did not tell Prophet Muhammad to threaten to kill the people who might have wanted to leave Islam because in Quran 109:2 – Quran 109:6 in 4 above people in each religion should be respected like you would want them to respect your religion.

Note 5. In Quran 3:159 Allaah did not tell Prophet Muhammad to threaten to kill the people who might have wanted to leave Islam because belief in Allaah must not come from fearing humans because that is a false belief.

Note 6. In Quran 3:159 Allaah did not tell Prophet Muhammad to threaten to kill the people who might have wanted to leave Islam because this is a matter judged by Allaah in Quran 2:62, Quran 4:123 and Quran 5:48 in 2 above and Quran 3:85 in 12 below.

Note 7. In Quran 3:159 Allaah did not tell Prophet Muhammad to threaten to kill the people who might have wanted to leave Islam because in Quran 88:21 – Quran 88:26 in 7 above Allaah says Prophet Muhammad is not a controller of people he is only a warner.

Note 8. In Quran 3:159 Allaah did not tell Prophet Muhammad to threaten to kill the people who might have wanted to leave Islam because in Quran 50:45 in 8 above Allaah says Prophet Muhammad is not a compeller of people he is only a warner because no one can believe in Allaah without the permission of Allaah as explained in Quran 10:99 – 10:100 in 3 above.

Note 9. In Quran 3:159 Allaah did not tell Prophet Muhammad to threaten to kill the people who might have wanted to leave Islam because in Quran 2:256 in 9 above Allaah says there is “no compulsion in religion” because every human in the world is given life until the time of their natural death to find their true belief in Quran 4:137 in 2 above.

Note 10. In Quran 3:159 Allaah did not tell Prophet Muhammad to threaten to kill the people who might have wanted to leave Islam because in Quran 18:29 in 9 above Allaah says "whoever wishes let them believe and whoever wishes let them disbelieve" and that punishment for disbelief comes from Allaah in the hereafter not from humans in this world because every human in the world is given life until the time of their natural death to find their true belief in Quran 4:137 in 2 above.

Note 11. The only true belief in Allaah is belief which comes from the heart and not from the fear of humans meaning all hadith stories which claim Prophet Muhammad said “whoever changed his Islamic religion then kill him” were invented after the death of Prophet Muhammad because such a statement seeks to control humans by making humans afraid not of Allaah but afraid of humans who threaten to kill humans showing that all such hadith stories were invented by humans who wanted to control humans by making humans afraid of humans.

Note 12. In Quran 3:159 Allaah said people did not leave Islam because Allaah put goodness in the heart of Prophet Muhammad so that he would be an excellent example of Islam meaning people who have goodness in their heart bring people to Islam and encourage people to stay in Islam without force or threats because there is no compulsion to join religion or to stay in religion.

This means Allaah puts goodness in hearts of people who bring people into Islam and Allaah removes goodness in the hearts of people to cause other people to remove themselves from Islam meaning in all cases it is Allaah who brings people to Islam and it is Allaah who is removing people from Islam.

11. Prophet Muhammad did not say “whoever changed his Islamic religion then kill him” because belief in Allaah from the fear of threats from humans is a false belief in Allaah.

Allaah does not want people in Islam who do not believe in Allaah that is why Allaah told Prophet Muhammad to say in Quran 5:54 in 1 above people can leave Islam if that is the will of Allaah and Allaah shall bring a people to replace those people who leave whom He Allaah loves and who love Him Allaah.

In the same way belief without doing good deeds is also a false belief in Allaah.

Satan Shaitan believes in the Last Day which is the Day of Resurrection and Judgement and Satan Shaitan believes in Allaah but it is a false belief in Allaah because Satan Shaitan does not do good deeds.

Quran 2:62 Koran 2:62 Truly those (Muslims) who believed and those who became Jews, Christians and Sabians, whoever believed in Allaah and the Last Day (The Day of Resurrection) and did good deeds, they shall have their reward from their Lord, and they shall not fear or grieve in the hereafter.

Quran 6:158 Koran 6:158 "... belief in it (Allaah and the Day of Resurrection and Judgement) shall not help any soul …. if in belief (he or she) did not earn good (by doing righteous deeds in their life). ....”

Quran 41:8 Koran 41:8 “For those who believe and do good deeds, for them is an everlasting reward (in Paradise Jannah).”

12. The same message of Islam in Judaism and in Christianity of submission to Allaah is protected until the Day of Judgement in Taurat Torah Exodus 20:2 “.... You shall have no other gods before Me Allaah” and in the Gospel of Jesus Isa by Luke 4:8 “… You shall worship the Lord your Allaah, and him only shall you serve” and in the Quran 47:19 “…there is no Allaah except Allaah …”

Quran 3:85 Koran 3:85 And whoever seeks a religion other than submission (to Allah Adonai Allaah Elohim G-d Allah HaShem Jehovah Yahweh YHWH which includes every human from the beginning of time until the end of time, for example stone idol worship) it shall not be accepted by Him (Allaah) in the Hereafter and (such a person) shall be one of the losers (in the hereafter. The word Islam has two meanings, the general meaning is submission in Quran 3:85 meaning anyone who submits to Allaah).

Note 1. The Muslim religion Islam is the religion of submission to Allaah (Quran 3:64).

Note 2. The Jewish religion Judaism is the religion of submission to Allaah (Quran 3:64).

Note 3. The Christian religion Christianity is the religion of submission to Allaah (Quran 3:64).

Note 4. Islam means submission and the Quran tells the Jews to observe the Sabbath Day meaning all Jews who observe the Sabbath Day are submitting to Allaah which means the word in Quran 3:85 is submission otherwise it would contradict other verses in the Quran and the Quran says it has no contradictions.

This means only one word "submission" is correct because it is the word with which there are no contradictions in the Quran.

a. Quran 5:54 says Muslims can leave Islam if that is the will of Allaah in 1 above.

b. Quran 4:137 says every human can change their religion until the time of their natural death in 2 above.

c. Quran 10:99 – 10:100 explains that Allaah has no interest in forcing people to stay in a religion in which they do not believe because the purpose of life is for each human to find their true belief before the time of their natural death in 3 above.

d. Quran 109:2 – Quran 109:6 shows that Allaah teaches respecting people who have different religions in 4 above.

e. Belief in Allaah must not come from fearing humans because that is a false belief in 5 above.

f. Quran 28:54 in 6 above Judaism and Christianity and Islam are three communities of Allaah.

g. Quran 88:21 – Quran 88:26 in 7 above Allaah says Prophet Muhammad is not a controller of people he is only a warner.

The only true belief in Allaah is belief which comes from the heart and not from the fear of humans meaning all hadith stories which claim Prophet Muhammad said “whoever changed his Islamic religion then kill him” were invented after the death of Prophet Muhammad because such a statement seeks to control humans by making humans afraid not of Allaah but afraid of humans who threaten to kill humans showing that all such hadith stories were invented by humans who wanted to control humans by making humans afraid of humans.

h. Quran 50:45 in 8 above Allaah says Prophet Muhammad is not a compeller of people he is only a warner because no one can believe in Allaah without the permission of Allaah as explained in Quran 10:99 – 10:100 in 3 above.

A person who says “anyone who leaves their Islamic religion must be killed” is compelling people to believe in Allaah by making humans fear humans instead of fearing Allaah meaning all hadith stories which claim Prophet Muhammad said “whoever changed his Islamic religion then kill him” were invented after the death of Prophet Muhammad.

i. Quran 2:256 in 9 above Allaah says there is “no compulsion in religion” because every human in the world is given life until the time of their natural death to find their true belief.

j. In Quran 18:29 in 9 above Allaah says."whoever wishes let them believe and whoever wishes let them disbelieve" and that punishment for disbelief comes from Allaah in the hereafter not from humans in this world.

k. In Quran 3:159 in 10 above Allaah shows how he forgives and prevents people from leaving religion not with punishment but with kindness as a mercy to them from Allaah.

l. In Quran 4:137 in 2 above Allaah shows how he makes people leave religion and makes clear that punishment comes in the hereafter because whoever leaves religion has a lifetime to find their true belief which means they have a lifetime to return to religion before the time of their natural death.

m. The forgiveness of people who were saved from leaving religion in Quran 3:159 in 10 above with no punishment and the lifetime given to each human to find their true belief as they accept religion and reject religion and again accept religion and again reject religion in Quran 4:137 in 2 above with no punishment in this world shows that the idea that people are to be killed for leaving their Islamic religion is opposite to what Allaah teaches in the Quran meaning this hadith story is invented by people who desire to be the controller of other people contradicting Quran 88:21 – Quran 88:26 in 7 above and these hadith stories are invented by people who wanted to compel other people contradicting Quran 50:45 in 8 above meaning these hadith stories were invented after the death of Prophet Muhammad.

n. Allaah sent down Quran 2:256, Quran 3:159, Quran 4:137, Quran 5:54, Quran 10:99 – 10:100, Quran 28:54, Quran 50:45, Quran 88:21 - 88:26 and Quran 109:2 –109:6 meaning Prophet Muhammad never said “anyone who leaves their Islamic religion must be killed.”

o. Prophet Muhammad delivered the message in Quran 2:256, Quran 3:159, Quran 4:137, Quran 5:54, Quran 10:99 – 10:100, Quran 28:54, Quran 50:45, Quran 88:21 - 88:26 and Quran 109:2 –109:6 meaning Prophet Muhammad never said “anyone who leaves their Islamic religion must be killed.”

p. Allaah repeats many times that the correct story is the story in the Quran.

Then Allaah asks many times who will believe a different story to what Allaah has said in the Quran? meaning all hadith stories that claim Muslims who leave their religion are to be killed were invented after the death of Prophet Muhammad in the same way as stories claiming Jesus is Allaah were invented after the death of Prophet Jesus Isa.

Quran 7:185 Koran 7:185 “... In what statement (words, news, reports, information, message, hadith) after (they have heard) this (Quran) would they believe?

Note 1. Allaah asks who will believe the Quran and who will believe a teaching that is different to what Allaah teaches in the Quran?

Quran 24:12 Koran 24:12 Why did not the believers (both) men and women when you heard it (the lie that Aishah the wife of Prophet Muhammad had committed illegal sexual intercourse with another man or in this example of the lies in hadith stories that Prophet Muhammad said 'whoever changed his Islamic religion then kill him” which contradicts the teaching of Allaah in Quran 2:256, Quran 3:159, Quran 4:137, Quran 5:54, Quran 10:99 – 10:100, Quran 18:29, Quran 28:54, Quran 50:45, Quran 88:21 - 88:26 and Quran 109:2 –109:6) think good about your own people and say, “This (hadith) is clearly a lie?”

Quran 25:29 Koran 25:29 – “He (Satan Shaitan with false messages, false words, false news, false reports, false information, false statements, false hadith) has led me astray from the reminder (of Allaah in the Quran) after it (the Quran) had reached me.” Satan Shaitan always betrays humans (by leading them astray away from the Quran).

Note 1. Satan Shaitan misleads some people away from the Quran with nice sounding stories that contradict the Quran.

Quran 25:30 Koran 25:30 And (on the Day of Resurrection and Judgement) the messenger (Prophet Muhammad) said, “My Lord (Allaah) my people have abandoned (deserted) this Quran (to follow false messages, false words, false news, false reports, false information, false statements, false hadith).”

Note 1. On the Day of Resurrection and Judgement Prophet Muhammad will say “My Lord my people have abandoned this Quran (to follow false messages, false words, false news, false reports, false information, false statements, false hadith).”

Quran 31:6 Koran 31:6 Among people is the person who shall accept baseless stories (words, news, reports, information, statement, hadith) without knowledge (of the truthfulness of the story) so that they may mislead (people) from Allaah’s way (in the Quran) and (by believing false stories they) make mockery of it (the Quran). For them is a humiliating punishment (in the Hereafter).

Quran 39:23 Koran 39:23 Allaah has revealed the best statement (the best message, the best word, the best news, the best report, the best information, the best story, the best hadith in) a Book (the Quran) whose statements confirm each other. The skins shiver among those who fear their Lord (Allaah) and then their skins and their hearts relax when they remember Allaah (in praise of Allaah and in prayer to Allaah). That (Quran) is the guidance of Allaah, He (Allaah) guides with it (the Quran) whom He (Allaah) wills. And whoever Allaah lets go astray for them there is no guide (to righteous behaviour).

Note 1. Allaah says the statements in the Quran confirm each other and this can be seen in Quran 2:256, Quran 3:159, Quran 4:137, Quran 5:54, Quran 10:99 – 10:100, Quran 18:29, Quran 28:54, Quran 50:45, Quran 88:21 - 88:26 and Quran 109:2 –109:6 which confirm there is no punishment in this world for peacefully leaving religion or peacefully changing religion.

Allaah says “The Quran is the guidance of Allaah.”

Allaah says “Allaah guides with the Quran whom Allaah wills.”

Quran 45:6 Koran 45:6 These are the verses of Allaah, We (Allaah through angel Gabriel Jibril) recite them to you (Prophet Muhammad) truthfully. In what statement (words, news, reports, information, message, hadith) will they (the humans and jinn) believe (and trust in) after Allaah and His verses (which they have in the Quran until the Day of Judgement)?

Note 1. Allaah asks who will believe the Quran and who will believe a teaching that is different to what Allaah teaches in the Quran?

Quran 77:50 Koran 77:50 In what statement (words, news, reports, information, message, hadith), after it (the verses of Allaah in the Quran), shall they (the humans and the jinn) believe?

Note 1. Allaah asks who will believe the Quran and who will believe a teaching that is different to what Allaah teaches in the Quran?

Note 2. Quran 7:185, Quran 25:29, Quran 25:30, Quran 31:6, Quran 39:23, Quran 45:6 and Quran 77:50 asks when you have the word of Allaah in the Quran what other report would you believe?

q. If hadith stories agree with the Quran then accept it and learn from it.

If hadith stories do not agree with the Quran then reject it and also learn from it.

On the Day of Judgement Allaah judges by the words in the protected Quran.

On the Day of Judgement Allaah does not judge by the words in unprotected human hadith stories.

The Quran is the protected word of Allaah including the words and actions of Prophet Muhammad which are described and protected by Allaah.

Read what Allaah says in the Quran and beware of hadith stories which seek to add something that contradicts the teachings in the Quran.

Hadith which contradict the teachings of Allaah in the Quran are false hadith stories.

Be careful not to mix the words of Allaah with hadith stories which contradict the Quran.

r. Allaah gave freedom of religion 1400 years before the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights.

Quran 2:62 Koran 2:62 (In the hereafter) truly those (Muslims) who believed and those who became Jews, Christians and Sabians, whoever believed in Allaah and the Last Day (The Day of Resurrection) and did good deeds, they shall have their reward from their Lord, and they shall not fear or grieve (and this is confirmed in Quran 6:158 for those in the hereafter who “believed” and did good deeds. Quran 5:69 repeats Quran 2:62 meaning stop and think about what Allaah is saying in these verses confirming what is in the Hebrew Bible and the Gospel Injil of the promise of Paradise Jannah from Allaah in the books of Allaah on the Day of Resurrection and Judgement for those who “believed” and did good deeds. The Quran brings the same truth which Allaah brought to the Jewish people in the Hebrew Bible and to the Christian people in the Gospel Injil of Jesus Isa by Mark, Matthew, Luke and John. The Quran is a confirmer of what came before it in the same way as the Gospel Injil is a confirmer of what came before it meaning the Books of Allaah confirm each other as proof Allaah is real and as proof His promise is real as explained in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQ3o3ybc-KA showing that without His permission no one can change His words in His Books which are with all humans today and until the Day of Judgement so that you can believe Allaah is real and His promise is real).

Note 1. The Jews who believed in Allaah and did good deeds go to Paradise Jannah.

Note 2. The Christians who believed in Allaah and did good deeds go to Paradise Jannah.

Note 3. The Sabians who believed in Allaah and did good deeds go to Paradise Jannah.

Note 4. The Muslims who believed in Allaah and did good deeds go to Paradise Jannah.

Note 5. Everyone who believed in Allaah and did good deeds goes to Paradise Jannah.

Note 6. This revelation is so important that Allaah has repeated it in Quran 5:69

In Quran 2:62 and Quran 5:69 the promise of Paradise Jannah is not for those who “believe” but only for those who “believed” meaning who died (past tense) because it is not until the time of death that your true belief or disbelief and your good and evil deeds are judged,

Allaah repeated Quran 2:62 and Quran 5:69 two times because it is only with Quran 2:62 and Quran 5:69 that there are no contradictions within the Quran and between the Quran and the Torah Taurat and between the Quran and the Gospel Injil as proof in Quran 4:82 to the Jews in the time of Prophet Muhammad who are promised Paradise Jannah in Quran 3:113-3:115 and to the Christians in the time of Prophet Muhammad who are promised Paradise Jannah in Quran 5:82-5:85 and to the stone idol worshippers 1400 years ago who are not promised Paradise Jannah in Quran 3:85 and to all people today and in the future that the Quran is from Allaah because the Quran contains no contradictions.

If Quran 2:62 and Quran 5:69 did not exist then it would be proof that the Quran was not from Allaah because without Quran 2:62 and Quran 5:69 the Quran would contradict its self and contradict the Torah Taurat and contradict the Gospel Injil.

Quran 2:62 and Quran 5:69 is good news for Jews, Christians, Sabians, Muslims and all the people in the world confirming they will all come together again in a life after death.

Quran 3:3 Koran 3:3 He (Allaah) revealed to you (Prophet Muhammad) the Book (the Quran) of truth confirming what came before it (in the Torah Taurat and in the Gospel Injil), and He (Allaah) revealed the Torah Taurat and the Gospel Injil.

Note 1. Allaah revealed the Torah and the Gospel and the Quran which are with humans today..

Quran 3:85 Koran 3:85 And whoever seeks a religion other than submission (to Allah Adonai Allaah Elohim G-d Allah HaShem Jehovah Yahweh YHWH which includes every human from the beginning of time until the end of time, for example stone idol worship) it shall not be accepted by Him (Allaah) in the Hereafter and (such a person) shall be one of the losers (in the hereafter. The word Islam has two meanings, the general meaning is submission in Quran 3:85 meaning anyone who submits to Allaah).

Note 1. The Muslim religion Islam is the religion of submission to Allaah (Quran 3:64).

Note 2. The Jewish religion Judaism is the religion of submission to Allaah (Quran 3:64).

Note 3. The Christian religion Christianity is the religion of submission to Allaah (Quran 3:64).

Note 4. Islam means submission and the Quran tells the Jews to observe the Sabbath Day meaning all Jews who observe the Sabbath Day are submitting to Allaah which means the word in Quran 3:85 is submission otherwise it would contradict other verses in the Quran and the Quran says it has no contradictions.

This means only one word "submission" is correct because it is the word with which there are no contradictions in the Quran.

Quran 3:64 Koran 3:64 Say, “O People of the Scripture (the Jews and the Christians) let us come to an agreement between you and us (Muslims), that we shall worship no one but Allaah, and that we shall ascribe no partner to Him (meaning, there is only one Allaah, we pray only to our creator the one Allaah and no one else, not to sons, not to saints, not to any idol), and that none of us shall take others for Lords instead of Allaah.” And if they turn away, then say, “Bear witness that we have submitted to Him (Allaah).”

Note 1. Allaah does not require humans to all be in one religion (Quran 5:48).

Note 2. Allaah does require that every religion worship only Allaah (Quran 3:85).

Note 3. Allaah says if the Jews and the Christians and others worship only Allaah like the Muslims worship only Allaah then the Jews and the Christians and others are correctly guided by Allaah (Quran 3:64).

Quran 4:123 Koran 4:123 (Entry to Paradise Jannah) shall not be based on your (the Muslim's) desires or on the desires of the people of the Scripture (the Jews and the Christians). (Instead) whoever does wrong (on the earth) shall earn (the punishment for the wrong) and that person shall not find any protector or helper other than Allaah (in the hereafter).

Note 1. Allaah will judge Muslims and Christians and Jews and every creation justly in the hereafter.

Quran 5:48 Koran 5:48 And to you (Prophet Muhammad) We (Allaah) revealed the Scripture (the Quran) with the truth that confirmed the Scripture that was before it (in the Gospel Injil and the Torah Taurat) and (for you Prophet Muhammad to be) a guardian over it (the Quran). So judge between them (the Jews, the Christians and the Muslims) by what Allaah has revealed (to you Prophet Muhammad) and do not let their desires move you away from the truth that has come to you. For each (community of Jews, Christians and Muslims) We (Allaah) have appointed a divine law and a way (of religion). If Allaah willed He (Allaah) could have made you (the Jews, the Christians and the Muslims) one community. But He (Allaah) tests you (the Jews, the Christians and the Muslims) by what He (Allaah) has given you (in the Torah Taurat and the Gospel Injil and the Koran Quran to show who is best in behaviour). So strive for all that is good. To Allaah you shall all return and He (Allaah) shall then inform you (in the Hereafter) about (the correctness of) the religious matters in which you (the Jews, the Christians and the Muslims) argue among each other.

Note 1. Allaah does not require humans to all be in one religion (Quran 5:48).

Note 2. Allaah does require that every religion worship only Allaah (Quran 3:85).

Note 3. Allaah says if the Jews and the Christians and others worship only Allaah like the Muslims worship only Allaah then the Jews and the Christians and others are correctly guided by Allaah (Quran 3:64).

Note 4. Allaah commands the Jews, the Christians and the Muslims to do what is good according to what Allaah has given them in the Torah Taurat and the Gospel Injil and the Koran Quran to show which humans are the best in behaviour.

Note 5. Allaah says that on the Day of Resurrection and Judgement in the hereafter every human will return to Allaah and Allaah shall inform them about the religious matters about which they argued.

Note 6. Allaah protects the Torah Taurat for every Jewish generation until the Day of Judgement (Quran 5:48).

Note 7. Allaah protects the Gospel Injil for every Christian generation until the Day of Judgement (Quran 5:48) in the following way.

Prophet Jesus Isa did not write anything because everything Prophet Jesus Isa taught by his mouth was already written in the Tanakh Jewish scripture meaning Prophet Jesus Isa did not add or subtract from what is in Tanakh Jewish scripture.

The four Gospel Injil are four reports about Prophet Jesus Isa meaning Prophet Jesus Isa never wrote anything and what he said was passed by mouth until it was written many years later.

Quran 5:68 says observe the Torah Taurat and the Gospel Injil and Quran 5:47 tells Christians to judge by the Gospel Injil (not by the other books in the Christian New Testament Bible because what Paul teaches contradicts what Jesus is teaching in the Gospel Injil and anything about fallen angels found in the Book of Enoch and in the Book of Revelation are all rejected in Judaism because in the Hebrew Tanakh scripture angels always obey Allaah. Jewish people do not use the Christian produced Old Testament Bible because many contain wrong translations of the Hebrew Tanakh) meaning whatever in the Gospel Injil is confirmed in the Jewish Torah Taurat came from Prophet Jesus Isa and whatever contradicts the Jewish Torah Taurat came from the unknown writers who are traditionally called Mark, Matthew, Luke and John in a test from Allaah described in 1 Kings 13:14 - 13:24 teaching that the word of Allaah will not change and do not believe anyone or any verse in Mark, Matthew, Luke or John which contradicts the teachings in the Tanakh which Prophet Jesus Isa said is with the Jewish people forever and will never change and must be followed forever by the Jewish people in Gospel of Matthew 5:17 - 5:20 and Gospel of Matthew 23:1 - 23:3. In this way a Christian can know what came from Prophet Jesus Isa confirming Tanakh and what did not come from Prophet Jesus Isa because it contradicts the Tanakh (which is the Torah law and the prophets and the writings like the Psalms) which Jesus was teaching in Gospel of Luke 24:44.

Note 8. Allaah protects the Koran Quran for every Muslim generation until the Day of Judgement (Quran 5:48).

Note 9. Entry to Paradise the Garden of Eden the Garden of Righteousness Jannah is not based on the question of Sunni or Shia or Muslim or Jew or Christian but it is based on your good behaviour towards all humans and creatures in this world and your relationship with Allaah (Quran 5:48).

Note 10. In the sight of humans Judaism and Christianity and Sabians and Islam are different religions.

Note 11. In the sight of Allaah Judaism and Christianity and Sabians and Islam are “different communities of Allaah” because they were all created by Allaah for only one reason which is “to submit to Allaah.”

Quran 30:30 Koran 30:30 “… No one can alter what Allaah has created (in religion, in the Torah Taurat, the Gospel Injil and the Koran Quran). That is the right religion (belief), but most people do not know (this).

Why will Allaah reward Jews, Christians and anyone who believed in Allaah and did good deeds in Quran 2:62 and Quran 5:69 when they did not follow Prophet Muhammad and the Quran?

Allaah explains in Quran 5:48 that the Jews and the Christians are following the Books Allaah has given them.

Quran 5:48 Koran 5:48 "... For each (community of Jews, Christians and Muslims) We (Allaah) have appointed a divine law and a way (of religion). If Allaah willed He (Allaah) could have made you (the Jews, the Christians and the Muslims) one community. But He (Allaah) tests you by what He (Allaah) has given you (in the Torah Taurat and the Gospel Injil and the Koran Quran to show who is best in behaviour). So strive for all that is good. To Allaah you shall all return and He (Allaah) shall then inform you (in the Hereafter) about (the correctness of) the religious matters in which you (the Jews, the Christians and the Muslims) argue among each other.

1: Quran 2:62 and Quran 5:48 show that Allaah is protecting the Torah Taurat and the Gospel Injil and the Quran until the Day of Judgement as proof to every generation of humans that Allaah is real.

2. The Quran confirms the Torah Taurat and explains the story of Prophet Jesus Isa in the Gospel Injil.

Allaah would not say the Quran confirms the Torah Taurat and the Gospel Injil and then allow the proof of Allaah in the Quran to be lost by allowing the Torah Taurat that is with the Jews today and the Gospel Injil that is wth the Christians today to be corrupted.

This means the Torah Taurat today and the Gospel Injil today and the Quran today are the truth and they are protected by Allaah so that no Jew or Christian or Muslim will be able to say in the hereafter that they were misled by Books of Allaah that were not protected.

3. The good news message from Allaah for Jews and Christians delivered 1400 years ago by Prophet Muhammad in Quran 28:54, Quran 34:37 and Quran 57:28.

1. Jews and Christians who follow their Book and also believe the Quran shall receive a double reward in the hereafter in Quran 28:54, Quran 34:37 and Quran 57:28.

2. Jews who follow the Tanakh Jewish scripture and believe the Quran are correctly observing the Torah Taurat.

3. Christians who follow the Gospels and believe the Quran are correctly observing the Gospel Injil.

4. Muslims who follow the Quran so that it agrees with the Tanakh Jewish scripture and the Gospel Injil are correctly observing the Quran.

Quran 28:54 Koran 28:54 They (the Jews who truly believe the Torah Taurat and the Christians who truly believe the Gospel Injil and also believe the Quran) shall be given their reward twice (in Quran 28:54 meaning twofold in Quran 34:37 meaning double in Quran 57:28) because they are steadfast (in their belief in Allaah) and they repel evil with good (deeds) and they spend (in charity) from what We (Allaah) have provided to them. (Jews and Christians who follow their Book in Quran 5:68 and also believe the Quran will receive a double reward in the hereafter in Quran 28:54, Quran 34:37 and Quran 57:28 meaning the reward for every good deed they do will be doubled because they believed the Quran which tells the Jewish people to follow the Torah Taurat which is their eternal covenant between Allaah and the Hebrew people forever and tells the Christian people to follow the Gospel Injil which is explained in the Quran and tells the Muslim people to follow the Quran in Quran 2:40, Quran 2:41, Quran 2:62, Quran 2:106, Quran 3:93, Quran 4:123, Quran 5:43, Quran 5:47, Quran 5:48, Quran 5:69 and Quran 13:39).

Note 1. Jews and Christians who follow their book and also believe the Quran will receive their reward twice in the Hereafter.

Quran 34:37 Koran 34:37 – It is not your wealth or your children that shall bring you close to Us (Allaah), but the person who believes and does good (deeds). Theirs shall be a twofold reward (twice in Quran 28:54, twofold in Quran 34:37 and double in Quran 57:28) for what they (the Jews like Quran 3:113 - 3:115 and the Christians like Quran 5:82 - 5:85 who follow their Book in Quran 5:68 and also believe the Quran) did (because they believed the Quran which tells the Jewish people to follow the Torah Taurat which is their eternal covenant between Allaah and the Hebrew people forever and tells the Christian people to follow the Gospel Injil which is explained in the Quran and tells the Muslim people to follow the Quran is confirmed in Quran 2:40, Quran 2:41, Quran 2:62, Quran 2:106, Quran 3:93, Quran 4:123, Quran 5:43, Quran 5:47, Quran 5:48, Quran 5:69 and Quran 13:39) and they (those Jews and Christians) shall live secure in the high dwellings (in Paradise Jannah).- (Continued in Quran 34:38).

Note 1. Jews and Christians who follow their Book and also believe the Quran will be given a twofold reward in the hereafter.

Quran 34:38 Koran 34:38 (Jews and Christians who followed their Book and also believed the Quran will receive their reward twice in Quran 28:54, twofold in Quran 34:37 and double in Quran 57:28 in the hereafter however) Those (Jews and the Christians who did not believe the Quran for example if Jews did not correctly observe the Torah Taurat by keeping the Sabbath Day which is their everlasting covenant with Allaah in every generation forever or if Christians did not correctly observe the Gospel Injil where Prophet Jesus said he is not Allaah "Allaah is my Allaah and your Allaah" meaning Allaah is my Lord and your Lord and "Allaah is my Father and your Father" meaning Allaah is my Creator and your Creator in Gospel of John 20:17 and) who strive against Our (Allaah’s) revelations by trying to make them (Allaah’s revelations) to fail (for example Jesus is the son of Allaah means Jesus is the servant of Allaah delivering the message of Allaah so his mention with angels in Gospel of Mark 13:32 and Gospel of Matthew 24:36 means that angel messengers of Allaah and human messengers of Allaah both do not know the hour meaning do not confuse angel and human messengers with Allaah because only Allaah knows the hour but His angel and human messengers like Jesus and Moses and angels do not know the hour meaning pray only to Allaah and not to the angel and human messengers of Allaah because those who do), they shall be brought to the punishment (of Hell Jahannam in the Hereafter).

Quran 57:28 Koran 57:28 All you (the Jews and the Christians in Quran 57:27 and Quran 57:29) that believe, Fear Allaah and believe in His (Allaah’s) messenger and He (Allaah) shall give you a double portion of His (Allaah’s) mercy and provide for you a Light (of righteous knowledge meaning Jews who follow the Tanakh Jewish scripture and believe the Quran are correctly observing the Torah Taurat and meaning Christians who follow the Gospel and believe the Quran are correctly observing the Gospel Injil and Muslims who follow the Quran so that it agrees with the Tanakh Jewish scripture and the Gospel Injil are correctly observing the warning from Allaah in Quran 4:136 that whoever has no faith in Allaah’s Books has strayed far away from Allaah because the Books of Allaah are the light) by which you shall walk (on the correct path in Quran 2:40 - 2:41, Quran 4:136 and Quran 28:48 - 28:49) and (in the hereafter) He (Allaah) shall forgive you (of your past sins). Allaah is forgiving and merciful. (Jews like Quran 3:113 - 3:115 and Christians like Quran 5:82 - 5:85 who follow their Book in Quran 5:68 and also believe the Quran will receive their reward twice in Quran 28:54, twofold in Quran 34:37 and double in Quran 57:28 in the hereafter meaning the reward for every good deed they do will be doubled because they believed the Quran which tells the Jewish people to follow the Torah Taurat which is their eternal covenant between Allaah and the Hebrew people forever and tells the Christian people to follow the Gospel Injil which is explained in the Quran and tells the Muslim people to follow the Quran is confirmed in Quran 2:40, Quran 2:41, Quran 2:62, Quran 2:106, Quran 3:93, Quran 4:123, Quran 5:43, Quran 5:47, Quran 5:48, Quran 5:69 and Quran 13:39). - (Continued in Quran 57:29).

Note 1. Jews and Christians who follow their Book and also believe the Quran will be given a double reward in the hereafter.

Quran 57:29 Koran 57:29 (Jews and Christians who followed their Book and also believed the Quran will receive their reward twice in Quran 28:54, twofold in Quran 34:37 and double in Quran 57:28 in the hereafter) so that the people of the Book (the Jews and the Christians who did not believe the Quran for example if Jews did not correctly observe the Torah Taurat by keeping the Sabbath Day which is their everlasting covenant with Allaah in every generation forever or if Christians did not correctly observe the Gospel Injil where Prophet Jesus said he is not Allaah "Allaah is my Allaah and your Allaah" meaning Allaah is my Lord and your Lord and "Allaah is my Father and your Father" meaning Allaah is my Creator and your Creator in Gospel of John 20:17 and that Jesus is the son of Allaah means Jesus is the servant of Allaah delivering the message of Allaah so his mention with angels in Gospel of Mark 13:32 and Gospel of Matthew 24:36 means that angel messengers of Allaah and human messengers of Allaah both do not know the hour meaning do not confuse angel and human messengers with Allaah because only Allaah knows the hour but His angel and human messengers like Jesus and Moses and angels do not know the hour meaning pray only to Allaah and not to the angel and human messengers of Allaah because those who do) may know (in the hereafter) that they do not have power over anything from the bounty of Allaah and that (all) the bounty is in Allaah’s hand. He gives it (Allaah's bounty) to whom He (Allaah) wills. And Allaah is the possessor of the great bounty (of Paradise Jannah).

Quran 4:40 Koran 4:40 Allaah is not unjust not even as much as the weight of an atom (to people such as Jews and Christians and Muslims and all others). When any good (deed is done) He (Allaah) doubles it (meaning Allaah doubles the value of your good deeds) and He (Allaah) gives a great reward (of Paradise Jannah in the hereafter).

Note 1. The good news from Allaah for Muslims delivered 1400 years ago by Prophet Muhammad in Quran 2:265, Quran 4:40 and Quran 33:31 is that Muslims will also be given a double reward for doing good deeds in the hereafter meaning the reward for every good deed they do in this world will be doubled in the hereafter.

Quran 98:5 Koran 98:5 They (the Jews and the Christians) were not commanded anything (from Allaah in the Torah and in the Gospel) except that they (the Jews and the Christians) should worship Allaah and be faithful in religion to Him (Allaah) and establish prayer (only to the one Allaah who created them) and give charity (to the needy people). That is the correct religion of Allaah.

Note 1. Allaah explains why Judaism with the Torah Taurat and Christianity with the Gospel Injil and Islam with the Quran are the same belief in one Allaah who is the creator of every creation.

Note 2. Not all Christians and Jews and Muslims are the same meaning in every generation there are some Christians and Muslims and Jews who are correctly worshiping Allah.

The Christian and Jew who believed in one Allaah like the Muslim who believed in one Allaah and who did good deeds on the Earth will be successful (Quran 2:62 and Quran 5:69).

Note 3. The sins of the prophets is a reminder to humans not to elevate the prophets instead of elevating Allaah.

Moses Musa sinned by killing a man and the messiah king David Dawud sinned by adultery (represented in the story of a man who had one female sheep in the sin of ewe, the sin involving a female) and murder (represented in the story by another man who caused to die something that did not belong to him in the sin of ewe, the sin involving a female) and the messiah king Solomon Sulaiman sinned by marriage to foreign wives who brought idol worship to Israel so that every human who comes after them can know that when you repent and correct your behaviour God will forgive all your sins without a blood sacrifice in Psalm 32:5, Psalm 51:17 - 51:19 in Tanakh or Psalm 51:15 - 51:17 in a Christian Bible, 1 Kings 8:46 - 8:50, Ecclesiastes 7:20, Proverbs 24:16, Ezekiel 18:20 - 18:23, Isaiah 1:18, Isaiah 55:7, Hosea 6:6, Hosea 14:2 - 14:3 and Micah 6:6 - 6:8.

Note 4. Those Muslims in the past who elevated Prophet Muhammad after his death and those Jews who elevated Prophet Ezra in the time of Prophet Muhammad and those Christians who elevated Prophet Jesus Isa in the time of Prophet Muhammad will have problems because they elevated prophets instead of elevating only Allaah (Quran 3:64 and Quran 4:123).

The Quran confirms the Torah Taurat and explains the story of Jesus in the Gospel Injil.

A. Prophet Muhammad in the Torah Taurat and Gospel Injil.

See Quran 7:157 comments in Quran chapter 7.

B. Every prophet of Allaah is “the Word of Allaah made flesh” meaning the word of Allaah comes out of the mouth of every prophet of Allaah in Deuteronomy 18:18.

See Quran 5:116 comments in Quran chapter 5.

C. How did Allaah save Jesus.

See 1. Quran 4:157 and Quran 4:158 comments in Quran chapter 4.

See 2. Quran 29:57 comments in Quran chapter 29.

D. The second coming of Jesus and every other human is on the Day of Resurrection.

See Quran 79:7 comments in Quran chapter 79.

E. Examples of hadith stories which contradict the teachings of Allaah in the Quran.

See Quran 25:30 comments in Quran chapter 25.

F. Allaah protects the Quran, Gospel Injil and the Torah Taurat as proof Allaah is real.

G. Jews and Christians who follow their Book and also believe the Quran will be rewarded twice in the hereafter.

See Quran 28:54 comments in Quran chapter 28.

a. The claim in hadith stories that Prophet Muhammad said “'whoever changed his Islamic religion then kill him” is opposite to what Allaah teaches in Quran 2:256, Quran 3:159, Quran 4:137, Quran 5:54, Quran 10:99 – 10:100, Quran 18:29, Quran 28:54, Quran 50:45, Quran 88:21 - 88:26 and Quran 109:2 –109:6.

b. These hadith stories and the verses in the Quran do not agree with each other.

c. This hadith story contradicts (is opposite) to what Allaah is teaching in the Quran.

Due to the widespread fabrication of hadith stories it is necessary today to check the truthfulness of every hadith story by comparing it to what Allaah teaches in the Quran.

The correct behaviour towards those who leave religion or change religion is to show them respect and maintain friendship with them so that they know they will be welcomed to return to religion. See Quran 3:159 in 10 above where Allaah shows how he forgives and prevents people from leaving religion not with punishment but with kindness as a mercy to them from Allaah.

The reason there is no death penalty for leaving religion or changing religion is because if a person is killed then the purpose for which they were created which is for each humans to find their true belief is violated.

It is not for one creation to destroy another creation because of belief because the only judge of belief in Allaah is Allaah on the Day of Judgement.

d. What is the purpose of life?

See Quran 44:38 comments in Quran chapter 44.

When people are taught how to twist the words of Allaah to agree with hadith stories which teach the opposite to what Allaah teaches in the Quran instead of teaching people to ask the question "does this hadith story agree with the teachings of Allaah in the Quran" the result can be people who follow the mistakes of other people instead of people who are led by the teachings of Allaah in the Quran.

In Christianity some people follow the story that Jesus is Allaah which is not in the four Gospels however because they believe something from outside the Gospel they twist every verse in the Gospel to show that Jesus is Allaah even when Jesus prays to Allaah in all the four Gospel Injil and even when Allaah says in the Gospel that both Jesus and the angels do not know "the hour" because only Allaah knows.

In Islam some people follow hadith stories which teach the opposite to what Allaah and Prophet Muhammad teach in the Quran as shown in the reference below and like some Christians they also twist every verse of Allaah in the Quran to agree with some thing that came from outside the Quran.

In this way some Christians and some Muslims have beliefs which contradict the teachings of Allaah in the Gospel and in the Quran.

f. The danger of believing false stories.

People who believe false stories invented by other humans after the death of a prophet can be made to believe other false stories invented by humans as seen in some Christian cults and some Muslim cults who followed stories supporting their killing of people and their killing of themselves.

Teaching people to ask "is this story contradicting the teachings in the books of Allaah" will help protect people from other people who are following false stories instead of following the stories in the books of Allaah.
