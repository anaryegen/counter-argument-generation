Reminder about praying in public spaces

When I was a child, I went to the zoo with my family. Back then, I didnâ€™t pray much, or engage with Islam much either. I saw a man pull out a prayer mat and begin to pray outside, in a quiet corner but nonetheless still exposed to many people, in an area where Muslims were a minority. I remember feeling shocked that he would do that, how does he have the courage? I wondered why he didnâ€™t just miss the prayer and do it at home. Alhamdullilah, as Iâ€™ve grown up Iâ€™ve become more conscious of my religion and salah. And whenever the situation arises that I have to pray in a public space, I tend to feel anxious, but I think back to that man who prayed in front of everyone, and it gives me the courage to do the same. Praying your salah in a public place is not only fulfilling one of the pillars, but will also give other Muslims the courage to pray in public too. May Allah reward this man, for influencing me in such a way so many years later. Share

Alhamdulillah this reminds me of the blessings of living in a muslim majority country where there are mosques almost everywhere as well as dedicated prayer space including a place to make ablution such as at schools, universities, malls, office buildings, sports centre, coffee shops, parking lots, rest area, airport, train stations, etc which I often take for granted.

This is exactly part of why I feel so encouraged to pray anywhere instead of risk missing a salah.

I live in the west, but Alhamdulillah there is no shortage of Muslims or Masajids in this area. However, it's still very normal to be at a social place where there are plenty of Muslims and when maghrib comes around, hardly anyone moves. I understand sisters may have an excuse, but what's the excuse for the males??? Its saddening honestly.

One time, my wife and I along with 1 of my Muslim friends pulled up to a halal pizza place right before maghrib and we went inside to order. As we were walking in, there were 2 guys eating in the outside seating area facing where we parked. We walked in and made our order then used the bathroom to make wudhu. My wife and I walked out and grabbed the 2 prayer mats from the back of our car and proceeded the pray in the small patch of grass behind our car. When we came back, I noticed the 2 guys were looking at us. My friend who was holding our table inside then asked for my car keys so he could go pray. He did so and returned. As he came back, one of the 2 guys who were sitting outside came up to me and asked if he could use the prayer mat. They both went and prayed behind our car. So, I take it as a badge of honor to pray wherever I am if I'm going to risk missing a salaah, b/c I know chances are someone out there needs that self assurance and encouragement.

May Allah gives all the courage and make us proud of being part of 'Team Pray Anywhere'!!

this isnt an issue, its when masses block public areas and streets that there is a problem

Being an aethiest, in a western country comprised mostly of Christians I find it offensive, as I find with all religions. Pretty much all the Muslims I've met are kind and honest and why wouldn't they be. Having to utter praises to Allah all day long has to make Muslims extremely mindful of their religion.Catholics too have all sorts of rituals designed at reinforcing their beliefs but their rituals are at least practiced in private. Making a public declaration like that seems demeaning and is disrepectful of others who do not share their beliefs. I'm seeing it more often these days and wonder if they've been instructed to do this to promote their religion. No real harm is done but I wonder where it all will end. I don't like to speak for others but I am pretty sure that westerners for the most part resent the "in your face" practice, to some degree.

The prayer has to be done five times a day at their respective times whether youâ€™re at home, work, outside, etcâ€¦ That means if youâ€™re outside and one of the prayer times is about to conclude, you have to do it right then and there (ideally, you wouldnâ€™t be leaving it to the last minute though). Also, the prayer is only for the sake of Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala; whoever does it to show off to people or to get in their faces about it isnâ€™t praying with the right intentions.
