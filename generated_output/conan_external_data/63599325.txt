UK: Police arrest 21 more men for ‘child sexual exploitation’ amid ongoing Muslim rape gang coverup

Oct 23, 2020 8:00 am By Christine Douglass-Williams

Greater Manchester Police in Bolton have arrested 21 men as part of an ongoing investigation into child sexual exploitation. This could be an indication of yet more “grooming gang” (a.k.a. Muslim rape gang) activity, even as that activity is still being covered up by British authorities. As reported by Breitbart:

The arrests come as the Independent Inquiry Into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) in Britain has been accused of orchestrating a “cover-up” by some of the people who helped to expose the grooming gangs operating throughout the country in the first place, allegedly overlooking victims, whistleblowers, and abuse hotspots such as Rochdale and Rotherham and instead focusing on the testimony of many of the establishment institutions which failed victims previously.

The identity of the men who have made up the “grooming gangs” is what is mainly being covered up. They are mostly Pakistani Muslim men who are, besides preying upon British girls, are also “grooming” Sikh girls.

In Scotland in January, a Muslim rape gang “consisting of around 55 people” was “taken down,” and the case was covered up by police.

According to the Scottish Sun, the gang was comprised of Kurdish, Afghani, Egyptian, Moroccan, Turkish, Pakistani and Iraqi men.

And yet in another report from the Bolton News:

Children subjected to years of traumatic sexual abuse were consistently failed by the police, child services and local councils…According to the “horrific findings and the response from Bolton’s council”….“Children, many in care, not only fell victim to sexual predators, but also to a system which allowed ‘brazen offenders’ to escape justice and reoffend, according to a new report. Police in Greater Manchester knew that many children were being hooked on drugs, groomed and raped by gangs.”

It was announced in May that

A paper to understand the characteristics of grooming gangs and help deliver justice for victims will be published by the government later this year.

The UK establishment has remained dedicated to protecting the perpetrators of Muslim rape gangs, betraying the innocent girls who were abused.

“Police make 21 arrests as part of investigation into child sexual exploitation in Bolton,” by Thomas George, Manchester News, October 19, 2020:

Police have made 21 arrests as part of an investigation into child sexual exploitation in Bolton.

Five men, aged between 19 and 20, were arrested on Thursday (October 15) on suspicion of engaging in sexual activity with a female child.

GMP say the arrests at addresses in Bolton, Bury and Chorley were made in connection with reports of child sexual exploitation between 2016 and 2018.

The arrests bring the total number of people held as part of an operation codenamed Pavarotti to 21.

Eight men were also arrested on October 6 on suspicion of offences including the rape of a female child and engaging in sexual activity with a female child.

Eight arrests had already been made in relation to the investigation, which was launched in June 2018 following reports of offences committed against teenage girls in Bolton.

All 21 men – aged between 18 and 58 – have been released on bail with conditions.

GMP said they were offering support to 11 victims, along with partner agencies.

Detective Inspector Dave Sinclair, of GMP’s Bolton CID, said: “The action we have taken in the last few weeks has been a significant step in our operation into child sexual exploitation in Bolton and I can assure the public that our work does not stop until we bring each one of those responsible to justice…..

Very Islamophilic police, committing this awful racist hate crime against these victims, belonging to a religious minority.

Better keep the TV turned off for two weeks in the Netherlands, knowing that they will only discuss racism within the police force with Islam victims during this period.

The fact remains that the perpetrators of the grooming gangs were almost all Pakistani Muslims.

What is it about the PAKISTANI SOCIOLOGICAL GROUP that the police ANTI-CORRUPTION SQUAD should study?

Start cleaning the rifles for the firing squads!

Oct 23, 2020 at 9:20 am

No. Start recruiting a few vets to exercise the skills they normal reserve for male cats, horses and certain farmyard animals. Or train a few amateur operatives in an appropriate application of two bricks – without anaesthetic.

Oct 23, 2020 at 1:03 pm

I will gladly supply the dull knives.

Oct 23, 2020 at 1:22 pm

Second-hand bricks are cheaper. Just make sure you don’t get your thumbs in the way when you operate.

“Slavery is a part of Islam” – Saleh Al-Fawzan “It is permissible to take concubines” – islamqa.com “It is allowed to take women as slaves” – Abubakar Shekau, Boko Haram

This information does not seem to be known to UK police or judges.

Thanks, Michael. Quoting authoritative Muslim statements is the best way to convince Western people that Islam instructs its pious followers to commit crimes against humanity.

U.N. Security Council Resolution 1820 criminalizes rape as a component of genocide (In 2008,) The U.N. Security Council adopted resolution 1820, which noted that “rape and other forms of sexual violence can constitute war crimes, crimes against humanity or a constitutive act with respect to genocide”.

Koran 33:50 – “Prophet, We have made lawful to you the wives whom you have granted dowries and the slave girls whom God has given you as booty…”

This verse is for Muhammad. Specifically, Allah allows Muhammad to have sex with his slave girls, but generally, the verse establishes that it is permissible for Muslim men to have sex with female captives.

This is underlined in Tabari’s History, volume 39, page 194. Here is the quote (explanatory words are in parentheses): “He (Muhammad) used to visit her (Mariyam the Egyptian Christian) there and ordered her to veil herself, [but] he had intercourse with her by virtue of her being his property.”

“Forbidden knowledge.” It is “Islamophobia” to take Islam’s “holy writ” at face value. Still, any step in the right direction is welcome.

Meanwhile here in the US the apparent violent abuse of very young foreign children by the son of a candidate for POTUS is being swept under the rug in favor of more “substantial” evidence of financial wrongdoing.

This makes me sick. Are the governments still covering up for fear that the moslems will leave their country? Or riot, murdering peaceful citizens?

Who came up with this dumbass idea in the first place? Did no one remember Spain? The crusades? Did anyone ever read a book? Read the smoke signals over the wire? What government officials have yet to join the global village? Who elects these idiots? Or are they being bribed by desert oil gold?

Our day-to-day life will soon be intimidation and strife, just like in every other no-go-zone these pillagers have infested for centuries. And why? Why? The sad truth is all over, and has been for years.

Look at all those White Nationalists.

The problem with all this awful vile child sexual child exploitation by those gangs of heinous Muslim criminal is terrible. Likewise with their continue Islamic/demonic gang rape of British girls is an Islamic misogynistic plague of ,those Muslims who do this have no respect for human life, so much less do those thugs care about the law. The law enforcement officers and officials should come down on those Muslim gangsters with much force. For this is the only language that those Muslim criminals will understand, they will not respond to the language of reason. Furthermore those Muslim hugs need to pun punished severely for their unconscionable heinously evil actions.

The officers of the law do have every right to come down hard with force against those hooligans. This statement is true because it’s upheld by the Bible which instructs that government law enforcement people are ordained by God to capture and punish evil doers. As seen in Romans 13:1-4. In addition, such heinous gangs are even described in the Bible in Proverbs 4:16,17. Which reads “For they do not sleep unless they have done evil; and their sleep is taken away unless they make someone fall. For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.” [N.K.J.V.] Moreover, it’s only a matter of time before those violent street criminals get what’s coming to them. Sooner or later all their heinous evil will come back on them. For as they say “What goes around comes around.” The reason that saying is the truth is because it’s based on the Bible. Which teaches “For whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.” Galatians 6:7.

Child rape and they’re released on bail? The legal system is in tatters

Grooming, fell victim to, system which allowed, in care (— still calling it that when it is obvious that they don’t care?), Kurdish, Afghani, Egyptian, Moroccan, Turkish, Pakistani and Iraqi (MUSLIM) men, a paper to understand the characteristics (Well, that’s been really effective, DECADES along.), reports of child sexual exploitation between 2016 and 2018 (So now that 2020 is nearly done, you’ve made a few arrests?), engaging in sexual activity with a female child (Replace with rape of a child and ongoing, relentless, religion-sanctioned pedophilia), operation codenamed Pavarotti (An Islamic name would be more accurate, and note that the community that supports this evil never pays, and that time served will be the duration of a sneeze, after which these government perps will refuse to deport them. Also note the ongoing lack of interest in exposing or prosecuting the government employees who are equally responsible.)

Now note the sane language of CHRISTINE DOUGLASS-WILLIAMS, speaking the only truth in an article not just about these arrests, but using their language of lies in order to shine the light of truth: “The UK establishment has remained dedicated to protecting the perpetrators of Muslim rape gangs, betraying the innocent girls who were abused.“ Add in the populace, as they have stood by while their establishment has persecuted anyone who exposes this.

Does anyone know the latest score on the number of these animals they’ve rounded up to date or how many more are in the pipeline? How sad for the UK Establishment that it can’t sweep this lot under the carpet with another celebrity-character-assassination-smokescreen after the absolutely appalling Cliff Richard campaign to bury the Rotherham outrage blew up in its face so spectacularly. Obviously the Government still thinks it’s got away with sitting on a certain infamous report because it’s getting near the end of the year and nothing has appeared yet – or they’re having trouble sanitising it convincingly enough to keep the muslim puppet-masters happy.

Oct 23, 2020 at 1:56 pm

Had not heard about that Cliff Richard biz. Thanks. Reading now.

Whilst you’re reading it up, take a look at the rest of the ‘Celebrity Sex Scandal’ media campaigns in the UK from Jimmy Saville onwards, when they started, the identities of the ‘celebrities’ selected for the ‘treatment’, what was going on elsewhere at the same time and – most important – the very serious court cases (mainly in the north of England) that were NOT being given front page (if any) coverage because the public’s attention was being saturated by the alleged sordid activities of well-established personalities whom they had (and probably still have) good reason to respect. Then perhaps ask oneself who has been organising all of this, why, and for whose benefit.

Nov 19, 2020 at 6:41 am

You are dead right there, the Grooming report is being doctored to remove all clues to names of officials who could be implicated so as to protect the identity of the guilty. However it is difficult to understand how long is necessary to do this, the time they have completed it the result will probably be a pamphlet.

Oct 23, 2020 at 1:49 pm

As usual, not reported in many UK newspapers.

Oct 24, 2020 at 1:54 am

UK: Police arrest 21 more men for ‘child sexual exploitation’ amid ongoing Muslim rape gang coverup ……………

This Muslim child rape never ends–I knew it was still ongoing, despite frequent official denials.
