Video shows anti-Semitism in Manchester and Bradford Daily Mail

A Jewish man was subjected to a string of anti-Semitic abuse on the streets of two major cities in Britain in shocking video footage.

In an echo of a similar experiment carried out in Paris in February, a man filmed himself walking in Manchester and Bradford while wearing a tradition Jewish hat to gauge the reaction of passers-by.

Journalist Jonathan Kalmus said he received abuse eight times more abuse in just a tenth of the time, in his experiment for the Daily Mail, compared to the Paris case.

A similar test carried out in the German capital, Berlin, passed without incident reported the Mail. "There was a shout of 'you Jew' at me as I crossed the road to Bradford City Park," Kalmus reported.

"Minutes later a man turned his head and yelled 'fight the Jewish scum' just behind my back. Some time later, three youths shouted at me across a street repeatedly: 'You're a Jew, not a Muslim... Jew, Jew, Jew run!'"

Kalmus called the results "a horrible reality". Meanwhile, responding to the camera evidence, the leader of Bradford Council claimed the social fabric was strong in the city.

Councillor David Green said: "There are generally very good community relations in our city. Like everywhere else, there are individuals who would discriminate against other people based on their religion, ethnic origin, gender or disability, but as a council we will always challenge this when it is brought to our attention."

However, the experience was not completely negative. In a Bradford coffee shop, Kalmus was greeted by a Muslim stranger with open arms. "Whatever was the reason for this man's gesture and insistence that I shake his hand, it was warm and hopeful," he said.
