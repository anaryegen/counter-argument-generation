Islam: The Quran itself preaches violence against nonbelievers

NOTE: This piece expresses the views of its author, separate from those of this publication

I think most Americans stand in unified prayer and sympathy for the citizens of France whose lives have been ended or devastated by the horrific terror attack that occurred and all the related events following that resulted in even more death and carnage.

Twelve people - 10 journalists and two police officers - were killed in the initial Paris assault. Five more innocent victims were killed in the hostage taking and escape attempt that followed the original attack. At least one terrorist attacker remains at large so the final cost and death toll is yet to be determined.

We must all confront the realities that are going on all around us and recognize that these horrors are perpetrated by one religion, Islam.

We are told Islam is a religion of peace; anyone telling you that is just engaged in uninformed, wishful thinking or is deliberately trying to deceive you.

Islam is not a religion of peace at all; the perpetrators of terrorism are following the edicts clearly given in the Surahs (verses) that constitute the Quran, their holy book.

The word Islam means submission.

The Quran dictates repeatedly that its followers must convert you to Islam or kill you if you refuse to convert.

Much of the Quran speaks not about religion but only about how one must submit; it commands how one must live, dress, treat women and slaves, and practice jihad.

VERSES TELL THE TALE

The Quran is replete with Surahs directing its followers to violence.

Some examples follow:

Surah 3:151: "We shall cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve (all non-Muslims) …"

Surah 2:191: "And kill them (non-Muslims) wherever you find them … kill them. Such is the recompense of the disbelievers (non-Muslims)."

Surah 9:5: "Then kill the disbelievers (non-Muslims) wherever you find them, capture them and besiege them, and lie in wait for them in each and every ambush …"

America and France must wake up and realize that we are at war.

A war that cannot be won by being politically correct, appeasing, ignoring or coddling the enemy.

Islamic terrorists are not going to just go away and leave us alone.

According to the Quran, they must persist until we are either all converted to Islam or killed.

Winston Churchill understood this problem when he wrote, "How dreadful are the curses which Muhammadism lays on its votaries! … Individual Muslims may show splendid qualities, but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force exists in this world."

I agree with the statement that, "Islam is a religion in which god (Islam's Allah) requires you to send your son to die for him.

"Christianity is a faith in which God sends his son (Jesus) to die for you."

The threat facing us now has already been faced by numerous tribes and nations that have already fallen under the onslaught.

It is an onslaught that we now face, and it is incumbent upon us to stand up and confront this menace and give our prayers and support to our allies.
