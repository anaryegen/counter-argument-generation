Human Trafficking: International and National Implications

Human trafficking is one of the most serious threats to the protection of human rights, as it exploits the most vulnerable populations in the most vulnerable circumstances in a predatory manner, both within and across international borders. The Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA; P.L. 106 – 386) defines human trafficking as inducing a person to perform labor or a commercial sex act through force, fraud, or coercion. Any persons under age 18 who perform a commercial sex act are considered a victim of human trafficking, regardless of whether force, fraud, or coercion was present. People who are trafficked are denied basic freedoms, are extremely vulnerable to global health risks, and are sold and resold within rapidly spreading organized crime networks.

The International Labor Organization (ILO) estimates at least 12.3 million children and adults are in forced labor, bonded labor, and commercial sex servitude at any given time. INTERPOL estimates human trafficking to be a $28 billion enterprise. The most comprehensive and far-reaching governmental report in the United States is the State Department’s annual Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report, which was mandated in the TVPA. The primary objective of this report is to “[free] victims from this form of modern-day slavery.” The legislation further requires the State Department’s Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (G/TIP) to promote global awareness regarding human trafficking, to develop country-specific strategies to help foreign governments to better tackle the problem of trafficking, and to classify their accomplishments or failures to adhere to minimum standards in a tier system.
