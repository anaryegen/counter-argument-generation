Why Charity is So Important in Islam

The word ‘charity’ is mentioned many times in the Holy Qur’an, and for a good reason; charitable acts and gestures of kindness, including helping those in need, sharing your wealth, supporting orphans, widows and more, also hold great importance and emphasis in the Book of Guidance.

It is crucial to understand that Allah’s (SWT) guidance is there to ensure we stay on the right path, remain humble, and want the best for others just as we would want for ourselves and our loved ones. Allah (SWT) has given us our hearts so we may feel compassion towards others, but it is both our hearts and minds that shape us into good human beings. Giving to others and helping others is not an inordinate act; it is simply humanity.

To that avail, Muslim Aid works to help those who need it most globally. You can donate to our Need is Greatest appeal here.

The Importance of Giving to Others

Inequality and poverty cause hardships in many communities, and this is part of the test that Allah (SWT) gives to those who are comfortable or financially stable. This test is to ensure we share our temporary wealth with his creation and show compassion to those less fortunate. After all, our wealth was given to us by Him, and it can also be taken from us by Him. 

It is, therefore, upon us, as our duty, to help our fellow brothers and sisters in need and to share compassion for those who are suffering. Although generosity in giving to others and helping is a natural act of humanity – it is greatly rewarded in Islam, too. 

There is no suggestion or guidance on when you should give, although many people choose to give during the month of Ramadan when the rewards are greatest for this life and in the Hereafter. Muslim Aid has many campaigns that run throughout the year, and we react quickly to support natural disasters and areas affected by war and conflict. 

Your continued charity ensures that our hard-working teams can continue helping those in Islamic communities and beyond. This includes those who will go without food and drink for the entirety of Ramadan. While it’s standard practice for Muslims to fast throughout the daylight hours of Ramadan, those in developed countries can typically nourish themselves once the sun sets. This isn’t the case for many in developing countries. Instead, they’ll be just as hungry and malnourished as they are during any other time of the year. Therefore, we established our Feed the Fasting Appeal to ensure that as many people as possible receive a nutritious Iftar and Suhoor. 

Giving Charity in Islam 

Charity also forms the third of the obligatory Five Pillars of Islam – also known as Zakat. It is the act of giving a portion of one's profitable wealth to those in need each year. The other primary form of charity is known as Sadaqah – which means voluntary charity. 

Whilst giving Zakat is obligatory for most Muslims, Sadaqah is optional. It doesn’t have to come from monetary wealth; giving charity in the form of Sadaqah can be simply sharing one's good knowledge or smiling at a stranger in the street. It can be a humble act towards others, helping someone physically or even helping someone away from harm. 

As previously mentioned, it’s important that Muslims perform charitable acts all year round; however, greater emphasis is placed on this during Ramadan. One of the most significant aspects of Ramadan is fasting, yet not everyone is able to fulfil this duty. For instance, individuals with long-term illnesses, pregnant women, older adults, and more cannot partake in Ramadan fasting. In place of fasting, they are expected to make a monetary donation known as Fidya. The cost of Fidya stems from the amount it takes to feed one person for one day; today, this equates to around £5 per day. Therefore, if a person is unable to fast for the entirety of Ramadan, they must make a Fidya donation of £150. 

Why is Charity Important? 

The Holy Prophet (PBUH) has narrated: 

“The believer’s shade on the Day of Judgement will be his charitable acts.” 

Nothing feels better than the act of giving that serves as a reminder that everything we have in this world is immaterial and never initially belonged to us in the first place. Be like the Prophet (PBUH), and never forget the importance of giving charity in Islam, not only for the good of yourself but also for your acts of kindness, which will help raise everyone around you.
