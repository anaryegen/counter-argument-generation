MOANA POOL: Dunedin mayor slams concerns about transgender people at swimming pool as ‘repugnant’

CAS SAUNDERS – 27 July 2022 – Herald

Dunedin mayor Aaron Hawkins has called a woman’s concerns about the transgender community “distasteful and repugnant” after her submission to the city council.

Dunedin nurse Jennifer Scott was concerned about transgender women using the female changing rooms at Moana Pool.

She asked for the council to ensure designated gender-based private areas, such as changing rooms and toilets, would be upheld in all facilities funded or owned by the council.

After her submission, Hawkins, who appeared shaken, told Scott her submission was “hard to listen to, and it was at very least distasteful, if not repugnant”.
