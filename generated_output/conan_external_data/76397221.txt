That seems like a poor reading of Caitlin.

Islam is a cancer on the world. Everywhere you find Muslims in significant numbers you find violence and conflict — everywhere. Their entire “religion”….which is far more of a political ideology than a traditional religion…is based upon the concept of Islamic supremacy.

Muslims believe all non-Muslims are inferior to them and are deserving of death if they refuse to convert to Islam. They are the only religion which deems apostates — people who leave the faith — as people to be killed. They not only believe that apostates are deserving of death…they follow through and kill apostates. Every. Single. Day.

Just look at Europe. Sweden is unrecognizable as the country it was only 20 years ago….in fact, Sweden now has the dubious distinction of being the rape capital of Europe. Same for Germany, where Angela Merkel recently had to admit the painful truth that there are many Muslim “No Go” zones. Places where even the police are hesitant to enter because to say they are not welcome is the understatement of the century. Ditto for France and Belgium.

There are only four European countries that might survive and still have the same “Western values and culture” they currently have 50 years from now: Poland, Hungary, The Czech Republic, and Slovakia. Because these are the only four countries in Europe whose leaders are actually looking out for the interests of their citizens….by refusing to take in any Muslim immigrants.

They don’t care that the EU is threatening them with financial sanctions if they continue to refuse to take in Muslim immigrants. They are the only ones not turning a blind eye to the fact that the vast majority of Muslims refuse to assimilate.

Muslims have no intention of ever becoming “Swedish”…or “German”…or “French”. They intend to dominate the entire world eventually.

Anybody who refuses to acknowledge this reality is living in fantasy world. Open your eyes and read the Quran and the Hadiths and you will realize that ISIS is not an aberration….they are actually closest to living out the will of Allah as conveyed to his pedophile Prophet Mohammed.

ISIS, Al Qaeda, and every other radical Islamic terrorist group can — and do — point to specific passages in their “holy book” which not only justify but command faithful Muslims to carry out their horrific atrocities.

American imperialism and military presence around the world is not an existential threat to the planet. Islam is that threat…and people who ignore that stark reality are living in a fantasy world.
