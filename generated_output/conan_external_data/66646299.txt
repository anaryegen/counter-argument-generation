Muslim Population by Country 2024

Islam, with over two billion followers, is the second-largest religion globally and projected to outnumber Christians by 2050.

Majority of Muslims reside in northern and central Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia.

Islam includes major denominations like Sunni and Shi'a, and internal conflicts, particularly between these sects, have led to armed conflicts in several regions.

Muslims are followers of the religion Islam, who believe in and live by the teachings of the prophet Muhammad. There are more than two billion Muslims worldwide, making Islam the second-largest religion in the world, exceeded only by Christianity. In fact, many researchers project that Muslims will outnumber Christians by the year 2050.

Although Muslims can be found all over the world, the majority live in northern and central Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. Many countries in these regions are more than 90% Muslim, including Egypt, Afghanistan, Syria, Pakistan, Turkey, and Iran. Any country in which Muslims make up 50% or more of the population is considered a Muslim majority country.

The country with the largest number of Muslims overall is Indonesia, which is home to over 242 million Muslims. This is about 87% of the Indonesian population and 11.7% of the world’s total population of Muslims. In Indonesia, Islam can be broadly categorized into “modernism,” which follows orthodox theology while embracing modern learning, or “traditionalism,” which follows the interpretations of local religious leaders.

While the previously mentioned countries possess the highest total number of Muslims, several smaller nations have larger percentages of Muslim inhabitants.

*Note: At 99.4% Muslim, the disputed territory Western Sahara would rank at #8–but as it has not yet been recognized as a country by the United Nations, it was disqualified.

Many Westerners might be surprised to learn that Islam is an Abrahamic religion, meaning Muslims worship the same God as Christians, Jews, and the Bahá'í Faith—though obviously with significant differences in scripture, theology, doctrine, and application.

Just as Christianity encompasses multiple denominations (Catholic, Lutheran, Mormon, Baptist, etc.), Islam includes two major denominations: Sunni (75-90%) and Shi'a (10-13%), as well as a number of smaller branches. For example, Muslims in Indonesia are approximately 99% Sunni, 0.5% Shia, and 0.3% Ahmadi.

The division between Sunni and Shi'a is nearly as old as Islam itself, having stemmed from a disagreement in AD 632 about who should succeed Muhammad as the leader of the faith. In the centuries since that time, additional theological differences have arisen.

The tension between various Muslim groups, particularly Shi'a vs Sunni, has occasionally led to armed conflict and terrorist activity. Muslim extremists are responsible for insurgencies in several African nations, and violence between Muslim sects has escalated into full-blown civil war in countries including Iraq, Yemen, and Syria.

Muslim population censuses and estimates took place over a number of years (generally 2017-2019). As such, total populations shown have been matched to the year of the census data and will differ from current populations.

Countries whose Muslim populations are 1,000 or lower are listed with a placeholder population of 1,000. Because their precise Muslim populations are unclear, percentages have not been computed.
