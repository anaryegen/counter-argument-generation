General trust in others can facilitate social cooperation and reduce uncertainty on a personal level. However, those from the dominant group in society are more likely to trust than those from minority groups. We examine the gap in trust for whites compared to blacks and Hispanics in the U.S., with special attention to how strongly individuals identify with their racial/ethnic group, which may help restore trust for some when it is lacking. Using the 2014 GSS Identity Module, we find, as have others, that whites show higher trust than blacks and Hispanics, but when we examine people's identification with their racial/ethnic group, whites show lower trust than blacks and Hispanics. A strong racial/ethnic identification among the majority (whites) is associated with group threat and reduced trust. We discuss how identification with one's racial/ethnic group appears to have different effects depending on whether one is of a minority or majority status.

General trust is important in society because it facilitates cooperation with others and helps society prosper (Hardin, 2002; Luhmann, 1979). In modern society often characterized by daily interactions with strangers, general trust can keep people connected and engaged with others (Delhey et al., 2011). In turn, connections and engagement can foster civic involvement. While trust in others is less common today than in the past (Heimer, 2001; Paxton, 1999; Putnam, 2000), it is lower among minority group members such as blacks and Hispanics than whites (Smith, 2010; Taylor et al., 2007).

While previous research has examined how trust is related to one's race/ethnicity, we add an examination as to how trust is related to one's racial/ethnic identification or how strongly people identify with their racial/ethnic social group. While race/ethnicity signals people's membership and status in a group in society, identification with one's racial/ethnic group focuses on people's views of themselves as a group member. The strength of identification with one's social group is important in generating feelings of belonging, and we think this may be associated with feelings of trust in society.

How strongly individuals identify with their racial/ethnic group addresses the extent to which people's self-views are intimately tied to their race/ethnicity (Phinney and Ong, 2007; Sellers et al., 1998). It is their self-perception of how much their race/ethnicity is a part of how they see themselves. For minority group members in society, strong identification with their racial/ethnic group may foster self-acceptance and inclusion that may buffer the distress that occurs with discrimination, but identification also may attune individuals to discrimination and exacerbate already negative feelings (Smith and Silva, 2011). We explore these possible competing effects on trust for minority groups.

For the white majority in society, a strong identification with their racial/ethnic group may strengthen the belief in their higher status in society compared to other racial/ethnic groups (Blumer, 1958). Given estimates that by the middle of this century whites will no longer comprise the majority in our society (U.S. Census Bureau, 2012), a strong white identification may then heighten group threat and generate negative feelings (Blalock, 1967; Blumer, 1958; Bobo, 1999). However, the increasing size of the minority population may foster intergroup contact, which may reduce negative views of others and produce positive outcomes such as trust in minorities (Pettigrew et al., 2010). We explore the competing effects of group threat and intergroup contact on trust for the majority group (Dixon, 2006). In general, the strength of identification with a racial/ethnic group may serve different psychological functions based on whether the individuals are of a majority or minority status, and in turn, different levels of trust in others.

We study these dynamics using data from the 2014 General Social Survey (GSS) Identity Module that is based on a national sample. Respondents report their race/ethnicity, the strength of identification with their racial/ethnic group, and their general trust in others in society. We control for background factors that have been found to be positively associated with trust as well discriminatory attitudes toward blacks that may be negative associated with general trust.

To preview, the results reveal that while there are differences in trust based on one's racial/ethnic group members, there also are differences based on how strongly individuals of the majority and minority identify with their racial/ethnic group. Whereas whites trust more than blacks and Hispanics based on their racial/ethnic group membership, whites who strongly identify with their racial group show less trust compared to blacks and Hispanics. Given the racial shift that is occurring in the U.S., the results suggest that a strong identification with one's social group among whites is associated with enhanced feelings of group threat, which may then be related to low trust in others. For minorities, it is less clear how a strong identification with their group effects trust. It may either buffer the effects of discrimination or exacerbate them. We discuss both.

In this study, we focus on generalized trust, also referred to as general trust (Yamagishi, 2001), or social trust (Hardin, 2001; Taylor et al., 2007).1 Generalized or general trust is an individual

We use data from the 2014 GSS Identity Module, which was administered to a national probability sample of 1303 adults age 18 or older. The in-person interviews lasted about 90 min with a response rate around 70%. In general, the GSS is an important data source because it simultaneously captures individuals' generalized trust and their membership and status in a racial/ethnic group in society. The GSS typically measures respondents' attitudes. For the first time, in 2014, the GSS also obtained

The means and standard deviations for the variables used in our analysis are presented in Table 3. Individuals report average levels of trust. Respondents are primarily white (75%), with a smaller proportion black (15%) and Hispanic (10%). The combined view of how strongly people identify with their racial/ethnic category, including how important and salient their racial/ethnic category is to them, how much they experience verification, and how proud they are to be a member of their

Trust in others benefits society politically, economically, and socially. It benefits individuals because it reduces uncertainty in the benign intent of others and fosters exploration of better opportunities outside one's social circle, though this comes with some risk. Those who trust others are more susceptible to exploitation, but if they identify untrustworthy others early on, they can minimize the exploitation and still obtain benefits that they could not have obtained on their own.
