In today’s global world, it has become increasingly important for individuals moving to a different country for work, study, or permanent relocation to successfully adapt to this new culture. Responding to recent calls in the literature for more ecological approaches to the study of cultural adaptation, we examine the effect of host country historical heterogeneity—or, the extent to which a country’s current inhabitants descended from a diverse pool of ancestors—on newcomers’ cultural adaptation to that country. Across two studies, we find that higher levels of host country historical heterogeneity predict higher rates of cultural adaptation among newcomers. This relationship persists even when accounting for individual characteristics of the newcomers and sociocultural/economic characteristics of the home and host countries. These results suggest that a country’s historical levels of diversity may contribute to the successful adaptation of newcomers above and beyond their personal characteristics, their home country environment, or current conditions in the host country, including current levels of diversity. These results have practical implications for facilitating newcomers’ successful cultural adaptation.

Globalization is a defining and growing trend in today’s world. About 14 % of the U.S. population and 10 % of the population in the European Union was born in a foreign country (Eurostat, 2017; US Census Bureau, 2010). Roughly 9 million Americans are currently working and/or living abroad (US Department of State, 2016). Consequently, cultural adaptation—or how well individuals moving abroad adapt to a foreign culture—is an increasingly important competency in this global context (Searle & Ward, 1990; Ward, 1996; Ward & Kennedy, 1999). Regardless of whether someone is moving for study, work, or relocation, successfully adapting to a new environment is important not only for accomplishing one’s goals but also one’s overall psychological well-being (Berry, 1997; Ward & Kennedy, 1999). Failure to adapt can also lead to early returns to the home country, which, in the case of expatriates, comes with significant individual costs as well as forgone investments for the organization (Black, Mendenhall, & Oddou, 1991). Given its importance for individuals, organizations, and society broadly, understanding the factors that drive successful cultural adaptation is of utmost importance in today’s global world. As we summarize below, the literature on cultural adaptation is rich and growing rapidly. Responding to recent calls to study cultural adaptation in an ecological context (Ward & Geeraert, 2016), we seek to expand current knowledge of the factors driving successful cultural adaptation by examining a novel, ubiquitous characteristic of a country’s societal context—their level of historical heterogeneity.

When confronted with a new cultural environment steeped in unfamiliar customs, norms, and behavioral patterns, people have to learn to adjust or change in accordance with these environmental demands (Berry, 1997). Cultural adaptation encompasses adjusting to various aspects of daily life, learning culturally appropriate behaviors, and acquiring necessary social skills to facilitate comfortable interactions with local residents (Ward & Kennedy, 1999). Prior research has identified a host of factors that drive successful cultural adaptation to a foreign country (e.g., Bhaskar-Shrinivas, Harrison, Shaffer, & Luk, 2005). Psychological research on cultural adaptation has typically examined how individual-level characteristics of foreign newcomers—i.e., their skills, personality, or demographics—influence their openness to and acceptance of the new cultures they encounter when moving abroad (Ang et al., 2007; Berry, 1997; Wilson, Ward, & Fischer, 2013). Traits linked to cognitive and social skills that facilitate seeking and carrying out interactions with local residents have been shown to facilitate cultural adaptation (Mendenhall & Oddou, 1985). For instance, a person’s cultural intelligence positively predicts their ability to adapt to a novel culture (Ang et al., 2007; Earley & Ang, 2003) and those with higher levels of extraversion show better psychological adjustment to new cultural environments (Searle & Ward, 1991; Ward, Leong, & Low, 2004).

Although the characteristics of the individual newcomer are important for cultural adaptation (Ryder, Alden, & Paulhus, 2000), researchers have recently called for a more ecological approach that takes into account the sociocultural characteristics of the context in which cultural adaptation takes place (Bierwiaczonek & Waldzus, 2016; Ward & Geeraert, 2016). There is evidence that the societal environment of the host country (or country of relocation) can be a powerful predictor of cultural adaptation (Ward & Geeraert, 2016; Wilson et al., 2013). For example, newcomers report lower levels of cultural adaptation in countries that have policies based on assimilationist rather than multiculturalism ideologies (Kunst & Sam, 2013; Ouarasse & Van De Vijver, 2004). Also, newcomer cultural adaptation is higher in more affluent or economically developed countries (Greenman, 2011).

Contextual factors related to the home country (the country from which one moves) can also play a role in cultural adaptation. For one, the home country’s social, economic, or political context may shape a person’s attitudes, motivations for relocating, or skills in interacting with people from different cultures (Berry, 1997). Additionally, the home country’s relationship to the host country has also been shown to predict cultural adaptation. Research in expatriate adjustment has shown that cultural adaptation is facilitated when there is low cultural distance between the home and host countries—or, when the two countries have similar social, economic, and political contexts, and moving between these two countries requires less cultural learning (Church, 1982; Shenkar, 2012). Interestingly, one study found that German managers were more successful in culturally adapting to the United States than American managers to Germany (Selmer, Chiu, & Shenkar, 2007). Despite an equal amount of cultural distance, this asymmetrical effect suggests that characteristics of the home and host countries may affect adaptation in different ways. Specifically, the direction of relocating may have mattered because of home country effects; for example, German values, attitudes, and work styles may better prepare them for living abroad. Alternatively, the effect may be explained by host country effects; for example, the environment in the U.S. may make cultural adaptation easier for foreigners.

In this paper, we show that one aspect of the societal context, historical heterogeneity— defined as a diverse ancestry pool of a country’s current inhabitants—shapes cultural adaptation. Moreover, using a multi-level approach to test its predictive power vis-à-vis other previously established factors driving cultural adaptation, we are also able to better ascertain the relative influence of individual versus societal predictors of cultural adaptation, as well as the relative influence of host versus home country characteristics. Below, we describe the research on the relationship between country-level diversity—current and historical—and cultural adaptation in more detail.

Current diversity of a country has been shown to be an important factor in influencing cultural adaptation (Berry, 1997; Boyd & Richerson, 2002; Morris & Liu, 2015; Morris, Hong, Chiu, & Liu, 2015). For instance, when newcomers move to countries with higher levels of diversity, they experience lower levels of discrimination, engage in more interactions with local residents, and learn more about the host culture (Ward & Geeraert, 2016; Wilson et al., 2013). Diverse societies may also signal to newcomers that local residents are more tolerant of different backgrounds, races, ethnicities, or cultures, and therefore encourage them to learn about and adapt to the host culture (Berry, 1997). Social norms of openness, which are more common in diverse societies, can facilitate cultural adaptation of foreign newcomers (Geeraert, Li, Ward, Gelfand, & Demes, 2019). That said, there is some evidence to suggest that highly diverse societies may be less open to foreigners (Stephan, Ybarra, & Bachman, 1999). When societies experience a sudden increase in diversity—for example, a large influx of refugees—local inhabitants perceive a threat to their cultural identity, which often leads to increased discrimination and decreased openness towards newcomers, potentially undermining newcomer cultural adaptation (Morris, Mok, & Mor, 2011).

We argue that a stronger predictor of cultural adaptation to a host country is historical—not current—levels of diversity. Whereas current diversity refers to the diversity of a society at the current time, historical heterogeneity refers to the diversity of a country’s ancestry throughout history. Countries that are high in historical heterogeneity are made up of a more diverse ancestry, meaning that the current inhabitants descended from ancestors from a wider range of source countries. Conversely, current inhabitants of countries low in historical heterogeneity descend from ancestors who lived in that same area (Putterman & Weil, 2010; Shrira, Wisman, & Noguchi, 2018). Historical and current levels of diversity are related; that is, countries that have had a long-term history of being diverse will also show higher current levels of diversity. Yet, there are several reasons why historical, rather than current, diversity may be a stronger predictor of cultural adaptation among newcomers. For one, there has been an influx of recent research showing that historical heterogeneity is a powerful predictor of behavior (e.g., emotion expression; Rychlowska et al., 2015), interpersonal interactions (e.g., emotion recognition; Wood, Rychlowska, & Niedenthal, 2016), and personality (e.g., openness to experience; Shrira et al., 2018). Whether a country is higher or lower in historical heterogeneity undoubtedly influences frequency of interactions with others from different backgrounds; however, the aforementioned findings related to emotion suggest that the influence extends beyond frequency of contact to shape cultural norms surrounding intergroup interactions (Shrira et al., 2018). Cultural norms are shared beliefs that typically take generations to develop (Cohen, 2001; Morris et al., 2015). This is especially true for deep-seated cultural norms such as openness to foreigners, tolerance of cultural differences, acceptance of newcomers, or norms that would influence cultural adaptation of newcomers (Leung & Morris, 2015; Rychlowska et al., 2015; Schwartz, 2006).

Proximal, one-time events that may increase the current level of diversity within a country (such as new immigration or economic policies) may not have the same effects on the deep-seated cultural values that influence newcomer cultural adaptation. Inhabitants of societies with higher historical heterogeneity have had sustained contact with foreigners and have been regularly exposed to different cultural rituals and customs (Rychlowska et al., 2015; Shrira et al., 2018; Wood et al., 2016). These local residents may therefore be less likely to perceive foreign newcomers as a threat to their cultural identity (Morris et al., 2011) and be more likely to engage with them, form friendships, and help integrate newcomers into their culture (Chudek & Henrich, 2011; Wilson et al., 2013). On the flip side, societies with lower historical heterogeneity have had less contact between diverse groups and may therefore have a more unified set of practices, rules, and languages that guide behavior (Rychlowska et al., 2015; Shrira et al., 2018; Wood et al., 2016). In societies defined by lower historical heterogeneity, deviation from the norm—or being a foreigner—may be less accepted, making it more difficult for a foreigner to integrate into the society.

Finally, knowing that generations of foreigners were successfully integrated into these societies, newcomers entering societies with high historical heterogeneity may develop more positive expectations around their ability to be culturally adaptive and experience more confidence and motivation to learn the new culture. Newcomers may also perceive the host culture as more welcoming and less discriminatory and these appraisals, in turn, could encourage them to engage more deeply with their host country, seeking out interactions with locals, learning the language, and adjusting their behaviors to the environment (Berry, 1997).

Taken together, prior work suggests that individual and contextual factors—of the home and host country and current and historical—may shape the extent to which newcomers successfully adapt to a novel host culture. Of these factors, however, as outlined above, historical heterogeneity of the host country may appear to play a more important role in shaping cultural adaptation than other aspects of the person or the context. In the current studies, we therefore examine the role of host country historical heterogeneity in predicting newcomers’ cultural adaptation and assess its relative predictive power vis-à-vis other predictors of cultural adaptation drawn from prior literature, including individual differences of the newcomers, and other home and host country characteristics. In general, we expect higher levels of historical heterogeneity in the host country to predict greater levels of cultural adaptation among newcomers. Formally, we hypothesize the following relationship:

Host country historical heterogeneity will positively predict newcomers’ level of cultural adaptation to that country.

Moreover, because greater historical heterogeneity often leads to higher levels of current diversity and current diversity may affect a population’s attitudes towards newcomers (e.g., Morris et al., 2011) and, potentially, their adjustment, it is important to distinguish the specific effects of historical heterogeneity relative to current diversity on cultural adaptation. In other words, for the reasons outlined earlier, we argue that host country historical heterogeneity can account for variability in cultural adaptation not explained by current diversity in the host country. We therefore predict:

Host country historical heterogeneity will predict cultural adaptation above and beyond current host country diversity.

Importantly, prior literature suggests a broad range of factors--individual and contextual--that may impact cultural adaptation. However, the relative contributions of these factors to adaptation are not well understood. We seek to address this question by assessing the relative value added in predicting adaptation by various types of factors and historical heterogeneity of the host country specifically. As such, we expect to replicate previous work showing that individual-level characteristics--such as cultural intelligence and personality traits, among others--and home country characteristics--including diversity--will positively affect cultural adaptation. However, in line with calls for a more ecological approach to the study of cultural adaptation (Ward & Geeraert, 2016), we seek to explore whether societal factors can explain variability in adaptation not accounted for by individual characteristics. Furthermore, among the various contextual factors that may matter--including those of the home and host countries, current and historical--we examine the relative importance of home versus host characteristics and, because we believe host country historical heterogeneity in particular is an important factor driving cultural adaptation of newcomers, expect historical heterogeneity of the host country to explain unique variability in cultural adaptation not accounted for by previously examined factors. Formally, we therefore hypothesize:

Host country historical heterogeneity will predict cultural adaptation above and beyond individual-level characteristics, home-country characteristics, and current diversity of the host country.

We test these predictions in two studies using samples of individuals who have lived abroad. In Study 1, we examine cultural adaptation among Peace Corp volunteers—U.S. citizens who moved abroad to a variety of host countries for work. We test the predicted relationship between host country historical heterogeneity and newcomer cultural adaptation (Hypothesis 1) and compare the predictive power of host country historical heterogeneity to the host country’s current diversity (Hypothesis 2). In Study 2, we examine cultural adaptation among MBA students in a global business school from different home countries who worked/lived abroad in different host countries. We test the predicted relationship between host country historical heterogeneity and newcomer cultural adaptation across multiple host and home countries (Hypothesis 1) and examine the contribution of this factor in relation to the effects of current diversity in the host country (Hypothesis 2), as well as individual characteristics and home country and host country societal factors (Hypothesis 3). The design of these studies allows us to address important gaps in the literature on cultural adaptation. First, the studies include variables at multiple levels of analysis, incorporating both individual level constructs (e.g., newcomers’ cultural adaptation, newcomers’ individual differences) and societal level constructs (e.g., host and home country diversity). As such, we are able to simultaneously take into account findings from multiple literatures focused on individuals and society, such as psychology, sociology, and economics—literatures that address the same issue of cultural adaptation, but that are typically studied separately using different disciplinary approaches and methodologies. By using a multi-level approach, we can consider how individual and societal variables jointly predict cultural adaptation. Second, in Study 2 we are able to test home and host country effects together and compare the relative importance of each type of effect on cultural adaptation. Most studies in the literature examine only home country effects (e.g., studies that examine cultural adaptation of newcomers from different home countries to a single host country) or only host country effects (e.g., similar to Study 1, studies that examine cultural adaptation of newcomers from a single home country to many host countries). With Study 2, we are able to address a long-standing question in the literature about how, when considered jointly, home country characteristics and host country characteristics may operate separately to shape cultural adaptation. Taken together, by more carefully examining what each set of factors--individual, contextual, home, host, current, and historical--contributes to variability in adjustment, we aim to identify the relative importance of previously studied factors while also elucidating the importance of historical heterogeneity of the host country. In summary, we adopt a multi-level, multi-country design to provide a more ecologically valid examination of cultural adaptation that takes into account the individual, the characteristics of their home and host countries, and current and historical contexts.

We first examined the relationships between historical heterogeneity of the host country and cultural adaptation in an existing data set of Peace Corps volunteers with experiences in different countries. Peace Corps members are American volunteers who live abroad for a year or more, working closely with inhabitants of the host country to complete large community projects. For volunteers to succeed, they need to achieve high levels of cultural adaptation—that is, make social connections with

We conducted a secondary data analysis of publicly archived data from the 2015 Annual Volunteer Survey conducted by the Peace Corps. A total of 5,213 Peace Corps volunteers completed the survey between June 8 and August 14, 2015 (Peace Corps, 2015). This represented a 90.6 percent overall response rate. Respondents in the survey worked as volunteers in 55 different countries. The publicly available report did not provide individual responses, only country-level data. Therefore, all data

Preliminary considerations

We first examined whether the nine items could be meaningfully combined to make a cultural adaptation scale. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted on the nine items listed in the Method section. The factor analysis was conducted using an eigenvalue cutoff of 1 and promax rotation, allowing the factors to be correlated. The results of this analysis suggest that the items load onto one factor. All but one item had factor loadings higher than 0.4. The item “How well can you communicate in

Study 1 provided initial evidence for Hypothesis 1 and showed a positive relationship between historical heterogeneity and cultural adaptation. Peace Corps volunteers who were stationed in countries with greater historical heterogeneity reported greater average cultural adaptation. Moreover, historical heterogeneity appeared to be a more important driver of adaptation than current diversity, supporting Hypothesis 2. While these results are promising, it is important to replicate the findings of

Study 2 sought to replicate the findings of Study 1 in another sample with more varied backgrounds and experience. Here, we examined cultural adaptation among international business students from a variety of different home countries all with extensive experiences working and living abroad. This sample allowed us to disentangle the effects of historical heterogeneity of host country (the country to which people move) from historical heterogeneity of the home country (the country from which

One hundred fifteen Master of Business Administration (MBA) students were recruited to participate in a survey from a global, international business school known for attracting students from all over the globe. Of the full sample, 86 participants (64 males and 22 females; Mage = 28.62, SD = 2.17) reported having moved from their home countries to live in a different, host country. Only these 86 individuals were included in our analyses. Thirty-two different home countries and host countries

Table 5 lists the means and intercorrelations between all key variables used in this study. As expected (Hypothesis 1), historical heterogeneity showed a positive relationship with cultural adaptation (r(84) = .36, p = .001). To assess the relative predictive power of historical heterogeneity of the host country on adaptation vis-à-vis individual and societal factors and test Hypothesis 3, we conducted hierarchical linear regression in which economic prosperity of both host and host countries

Study 2 lent further support to our hypotheses. We found that only historical heterogeneity of the host country positively predicted cultural adaptation to that country (Hypothesis 1), such that people reported higher levels of cultural adaptation to countries that were historically more diverse, and that this was arguably more impactful than their personal skills, demographics, economic and diversity features of their home country, or the current conditions of the host country (Hypothesis 3).

Across two studies using survey data from people of various backgrounds living and working in a host of different foreign countries for numerous reasons, we found consistent evidence for our central hypothesis (Hypothesis 1)—people reported higher levels of cultural adaptation in countries with greater historical heterogeneity. In other words, countries that had long-standing traditions of immigration and cultural diversity among its citizens appeared to facilitate cultural adaptation to these

Is There No Place Like Home? Expatriates' Locus of Control Personality, Self-efficacy, Cross-cultural Adjustment, and Organizational Support for Expatriate Career

2023, International Journal of Intercultural Relations

Expatriates are crucial for multinational corporations' internationalization strategy due to their connective position between headquarters and overseas branches. Understanding expatriates' willingness to remain in the foreign branches may allow organizations to avoid wasting the substantial cost of international human resource transitions and to strengthen the effectiveness of firm strategic deployment. Perceived causality orientation in the international job transition may influence how expatriates cognitively adjust themselves to fit into a new cultural environment, though little work has considered the psychological processes that influence employees’ intention to stay. The study, therefore, explores the relationship between expatriates' causality orientation and their intention to remain in the foreign position through the mediating effect of cross-cultural adjustment process. This considers the social cognitive theory (SCT) and investigates the moderating role of expatriates' self-efficacy and perceived organizational support for their career. The hypotheses proposed in this paper are tested using a unique sample of 219 Taiwanese expatriates in Vietnam. Results show that expatriates with high levels of internal control personality have higher cross-cultural adjustment, and expatriates with better adjustment in different cultural contexts have stronger willingness to stay. However, external locus of control weakens the expatriates' cross-cultural adjustment process when they have low levels of self-efficacy. Counterintuitively, the findings suggest that expatriates’ perceived organizational career support will reduce the positive relationship between their cross-cultural adjustment and the intention to stay.
