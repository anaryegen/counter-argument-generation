Why did the muslims conquer other countries even though the quran is only preaching self defense?

Back in the days of empires, it was either eat or be eaten. The Muslim empire wasn't exempt. What makes Islam stand out is that we were given rules of war.

Thank you. I didn't know

Yeah. Muslims could follow the norms of their time 1400 years ago, but not today.

Don‚Äôt lie. Rules don‚Äôt change, we can understand them, but say for example, you can‚Äôt fight Israel? Or what about china if there‚Äôs a chance? You only can‚Äôt fight muslims, this isn‚Äôt to say todays country are ruling by Islam, by you don‚Äôt fight people you have treaties with. Expanding in land/war was always allowed. The countries don‚Äôt do it as much today but they fight muslims overseas, muslims shouldn‚Äôt be ignorant and weak. There‚Äôs jihad al-nafs and jihad in context of fighting. Would you go to children/women who can only be protected under an Islamic cause, not under the tyrannic socialism/capi/com secular tule they‚Äôre currently under, and say what you say? This is why it‚Äôs important to study Islam. Make yourself aware of tafsir, hadith, sharh. Tafsir is commentary for Quran (ibn kathir is recommended and it shows when you click a book icon on quran.com) https://quran.com/47:6/tafsirs/en-tafisr-ibn-kathir

Sharh is explanation for hadiths.

Can muslims use the rule eat or be eaten in today‚Äôs world? What has changed? Because Muslims live happily under USA‚Äôs world dominance?

I think the difference is that in modern developed nations you can practice your religion freely. In earlier times nearly every major religion, culture or ideology was war-hungry and just wanted more land.

What is more oppressive than a kingdom not allowing practise of Islam and preventing call to Allah? Oppressive rulers and armies were defeated.

Forced conversion was very rare, looking at demographics of Egypt and Levant shows this. Even in the 12th century, nearly half were still non muslim, this is 4/500yrs years after conquest.

Sassanids (Zoastrians) and Romans (Byzantine Christians) were destroying each other for hundreds of years before any Islam conquest.

There were many jews and christians in Al-Andalus, curiosly the jews were killed and expelled by the christians when they got most of the land

"What is more oppressive than a kingdom not allowing practise of Islam and preventing call to Allah? Oppressive rulers and armies were defeated"

So , if a Muslim country today oppressess other religion in their country , is it okay to invade them , if we are looking your logic .

It's not "their" logic. It's Sharia law. A (supposedly) Muslim country that forbids other religions goes directly against the word of God, ergo, its applied a non-Islmaic law in the name of Islam, which is heresy, and appropriate measures should be taken to rectify that grievous slight against God.

That being said, since when do non-Muslims follow Sharia law?

You should follow your OWN laws.

We live in a time where international law is in effect, and while the West loves flouting it whenever it pleases them, international law clearly states that use or threat of force against the territorial integrity or political sovereignty of another State is illegal. Force may be used for the purpose of self defense and within the confines of necessity and proportionality.

Here's a list of countries that practice religious intolerance. Go invade them.

https://www.indexoncensorship.org/2014/01/worst-countries-religious-freedom/

certainly it was less than other civilizations but forced conversion wasn‚Äôt rare, islamic states put heavy pressure in other areas such as economy and social life on other people. So they were forced in a way.

Brother if you don't know history don't talk. The taxes bin Muslims played were much less than our own zakat.

Source? You don'T know history bro. Ottoman Caliphate always put more tax on dhimmis as well as previous ones. And there is no set payment of jizya in Islamic sharia unlike zakat. So no need to sugar coat our history. I'm being unbiased. You haven'T done your homework

Nope. You learned from some Jews and christians who try to make us look bad. I do not sugar coat anything, but to say that they were at a disadvantage or had a hard life or were forced to convert is plain simply wrong

Sounds like an excuse to conquor to me

I will answer to the best of my ability though keep in mind that I am not a scholar.

War to conquer territory, although it is frowned upon today, was normal at the time of the Prophet PBUH. Allah knows this and says in the Quran that if you choose to conquer territory, to fight in the way of Allah. But there are rules in war, of which some are: don‚Äôt hurt women, children, elderly, civilians, trees, animals.

I‚Äôm not sure which verses say that war is ONLY allowed in self-defense. Could you reference these verses?

InfiniteResolution33

There are many valid and clear justified reasons for who study the history of this period

Muslims empire was starting in the middle between two large empires which were fighting each other for hundreds of years Persian Empire at the east and Roman Empire at the north and the west of the Arab Peninsula

They would not allow any new empire or any united power to show upon next to their borders and they always expanding toward each other and the Muslims in the middle

And in Quran, in chapter named ‚ÄúThe Roman‚Äù the God is saying in Quran:

Corruption has appeared throughout the land and sea by [reason of] what the hands of people have earned so He may let them taste part of [the consequence of] what they have done that perhaps they will return [to righteousness].

https://recitequran.com/30:41

People did suffer a lot during this period because of Roman and Parisian empire and The God sent Islam a mercy to all world

Also, No way for Islam to be present today if not removing such two empires from power and war against Roman Empire start long back during prophet Muhammad PBUh life already when they wanted to invade Arab lands, to terminate new Islamic power showing up

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expedition_of_Tabuk

Prophet Muhammad united the Arab for the first time in the history and created one nation worship only the God , the creator alone instead of idols worshiping; as the prophecy in Genesis 21:18 as the children of Ishmael become a great nation. And such united nation next to the border of Parisian empire and Roman Empire will be not be allowed and will be destroyed and the only valid defense action was to remove them otherwise they would keep fighting for hundreds of years to come

Nice video to watch if you are interested to know what occurred in this 50 years from world history point of view

The above lecture by non-Muslims explain in details this period and actually how Islam save protected the people and give them freedom

It‚Äôs not okay, it‚Äôs better to preach Islam to him peacefully. Violence is never the default.

Comment deleted by user

If you actually examine the history, the Muslims began with at least partially the goal of getting all of the Arab tribes within Muslim rule.

Unfortunately Rome and the Sassanids controlled much of the Arab tribes. Battles broke out, both nations sought to destroy the Muslim empire threatening them, and the Muslims defeated both.

That opened the Levant, Egypt, North Africa, Persia, Anatolia up for the Muslim.

Umar Ibn Al Khattab famously said I wish that between the Suwad and the Persian hills there were walls which would prevent them from getting to us, and prevent us from getting to them. The fertile Suwad is sufficient for us; and I prefer the safety of the Muslims to the spoils of war.

Similarly, Umar really didn‚Äôt want to capture Egypt and beyond yet his generals were easily able to capture lands with little real resistance.

As he kept asking the Muslim military leadership to leave Persia alone, but Persia kept attacking the Muslims attempting to recapture land.

The Romans under Heraculus and Vahn, Gregory, Canatir basically chased the Muslims down until the Muslims.

If you examine the history from an unbiased source, the Muslims took Arab tribes under the fold which were occupied by Rome and Persia. That upset the 2 superpowers of the time. War started on both sides. The Muslims kept slapping both armies around making them attack the Muslims more. Then large swathes of land fell into the Muslims‚Äô Laps.

They didnt kill civilians and let them keep their religion

To give the people the freedom to choose their religion , and still Cristians in Egypt today (around 10%) and many Jews were in Egypt and Morocco for along time which means that they did not force them , they give the people the freedom to choose and did not force them to enter Islam . But in the same time the expand of the Islamic empire was mandatory to its survival .

Because they refused the message and therefore wouldn't allow preaching of it

InfiniteResolution33

No not Ok, but the motivation was to protect the religion and to give the people the freedom to choose their religion which was not available under Roman Empire for example , and to make easy to people to choose other religions

And Islam started in the middle between two empires Roman and Parisian empire, and there was not way for islam to exist without pushing back Against those two empires which one of them already start attacking the new united Arab tribes in the time of the prophet Muhammad PBUh

For more details about this period, this graduate lecture by non Muslim, is exploring in very detail the historical events in this period and you should reach to clear conclusions that there was no way for Muslims to survive without taking down both Roman and Parisian empire and they did this in parallel and in the same time and fight on the two side as this was matter of live or death to the Muslims and to be able to survive and to give the people the freedom to choose religion

Please try to give it some time , it will be informative

Umm idk who told u it‚Äôs just for self defence, i think that false assumption is the issue. You can also do offensive wars if there is injustice in other lands or if the message of Islam is not allowed to be preached.

In the case of spains invasion, Muslim armies were invited by a Spanish king who‚Äôs daughter was raped by another king. Constantine was similar in the sense that oppression was going on and the word of Allah wasn‚Äôt allowed.

Anyways long story short, we can go to war for multiple reasons not just defensive.

I didn't know that even being a muslim, can you link me any web with that info

Who was the monarch that invited the muslims?

Im case of the Visigothic king,it's a myth.

invited by a Spanish king

Islam does not say violence is only permissible for self defense. Offensive jihad is indeed a reality in Islam, and we should be aware of it. If it's in the interest of the Ummah, then the Kahlifah can call for offensive jihad to expand the reaches of the religion and so on. However, there are boundaries that cannot be overstepped in warfare and expansion, like no forced conversions and other things.

What if islam is oppressed in a country today , can you invade it ?

Offensive jihad is indeed a reality in Islam

Where in the Quran does it say this?

Did the Prophet PBUH not conquer madinah? Did they not attack caravans? Did Sahabah not conquer other lands?

Not if the Quran prohibits such actions. If one believes otherwise, they would necessarily need to believe the messenger acted on his own whims outside of the guidance of Allah, which is impossible.

Or, that such conquests are permissible and in accordance with the Quran. Hence the central question, where in the Quran are such offensive conquests permitted?

Here‚Äôs a prophecy he makes, battle is allowed as long as people do not surrender. When I came across this report in a playlist of Farid discussing Proofs of Prophethood I didn‚Äôt think bad of it but I understood it. There‚Äôs defensive and offensive. Someone who‚Äôs only convinced of the first will get confused if they see reports like these. ‚ÄúNarrated Sulaiman bin Surd: When the clans were driven away, I heard the Prophet (Ô∑∫) saying, "From now onwards we will go to attack them (i.e. the infidels) and they will not come to attack us, but we will go to them."

https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4110

The muslims here were betrayed and the jews were dealing with weapons to the polytheists in secret. (I don‚Äôt remember if they did something else like planning with them/killing but they betrayed) The muslims succeeded. I don‚Äôt remember which one but if you go through his videos you‚Äôll come across it, maybe the title ‚Äúbattle of the trench‚Äù 27 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ7UxUjcFlM

Well, this is a complex topic. To start off, Islam and the Holy Qur'an allow for expansion, and before Qayamat (the apocalypse), Islam will reach all seven continents, probably including Antarctica. It's possible that that could be da'wah on the internet, but it's possible there are good people fighting the right way that will expand Islam into the Americas, Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Oceania. When it is done, it must be done responsibly with the respect of women, children, and non-combatants in mind. The standards will be higher than the Geneva Conventions.

Since at least 1700 (when the Ottoman Empire began losing territory), most wars that occurred in the Muslim world have been self-defense. This trend has continued all the way into the present (2023 CE / 1444 Hijri). There were wars on the defensive from the Crusades and the Mongols, but the Crusaders were vanquished and the Mongols did eventually become Muslims themselves (at least in the parts that they administered over Muslim lands), so the period from 1096 to about 1291 can be seen as a hiccup. Two centuries of a hiccup, but still, they have some parallels to the present era. Even then, Western imperialism, neo-colonialism, and Zionist aggression offer their own distinct challenges.

Even though countries such as Persia (now called Iran) and Egypt were conquered, it took several centuries for the majority of the population to embrace Islam. May Allah forgive us for all those times we failed to live up to His Holy Book. Ameen. Islam is a reasonable religion, and we must provide for justice, whether social, economic, or political to all people, whether Muslim or not. Many wars, unfortunately, have been in the colour of Islam. What does this mean? People were politically and economically motivated. They wanted money and power, and often just pretended, but of course, only Allah Ta'ala knows what is in our hearts. Islamophobes, who hate our religion, try to make these political wars something that our religion justifies. The Sahabah generally did the expansion properly, but the subsequent generations had some problems when they went to war. It is hard to live up to their standards, but we need to try. May Allah help us. Ameen.

There is an irrational fear of Islam that justifies the carpet bombing of Gaza, and this is what I refer to as Islamophobia. Since you are replying to a comment from 5 months ago, I took the opportunity to reflect on recent current events. You, in your attempt to prop up your values, look the other way when the Zionists treat the Palestinians. Next you will tell me that this is Hamas' fault and I'm not doing enough to condemn them. Zionists play some of the biggest victims out there, but the way your mind is currently structured, we play the victims and only the things we do are wrong. See those other religions; why can't you be like them? This is all I am hearing from you.

Have a nice day, Sir. Oh, by the way, You won't receive d---- threats from me, but I have had people ask me to commit sui----. I certainly won't do that to you. Maybe you're not a nihilist, so you won't say things like that. God willing, you will appreciate the beauty of Islam someday. I say this as your well-wisher. There is hope in Almighty God that even haters of Islam can transform into believers of it. Peace.

Quran doesn‚Äôt only preach self defense

Because Allah instructed us to spread Islam far and wide. Did you really just expect Islam to stay in Mecca and Medina?

Indonesia is the most populous Muslim country on Earth, yet no Arab Muslim army ever showed up there conquering throughout its history. Islam was spread there peacefully through Arab traders and Sufi ulemas.

Unique-Possession623

Exactly. Same thing with Islam in Nigeria Senegal and west Africa and even with Sudan. Arabs never conquered these areas yet Islam expanded there especially through Sufi scholars same with Islam in China and the philippines as well. Ppl who seriously think Islam spread through war and the sword know nothing and only have adopted the orientalist racist rewriting of history. Much of the lands that were acquired by Arab empires came from defeating the Persians and the Byzantine cause you would inherit their territories after you defeat that empire.

It is He [Allah] who sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth so that it might dominate over all all other ways of life, even though the idolaters hate it.

This ayah, and the life of our beloved Prophet Ô∑∫, show that Islam is intended to be spread to all the people of the world - to dominate over all other ways of life until the Shariah of Allah is dominant on Earth. As part of this mission, Allah has given us Jihad, which is a method to remove obstacles for people accepting the Deen.

Sometimes this meant that Muslims would open up new lands and bring them under the light of Islam. All this was part of achieving the mission of Islam.

The Qur'an absolutely does not only preach self defence, indeed propagation of Islam is a key part of our Deen

The word ŸÑŸêŸäŸèÿ∏ŸíŸáŸêÿ±ŸéŸáŸè€• you referenced in surah As-Saf does not mean to conquest, or dominate physically, as that would contradict this ayah

Surah Al-Baqara 2:256

Let there be no compulsion in religion, for the truth stands out clearly from falsehood.1 So whoever renounces false gods and believes in Allah has certainly grasped the firmest, unfailing hand-hold. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.

There is no contradiction here at all - for Islam to dominate over people, as I said, it does not mean that people are forced to become Muslim. It means that the Shariah of Allah is applied on a land.

For example in Madinah, there were Jews and Christians, they were allowed to keep their religion and their rights to follow their own religion was protected. But Islam was dominant over them i.e - the laws and ruling of society was conducted only according to Islam.

Islam dominated over Syria, Persia and Egypt in the Khilafah of Abu Bakr RA and Umar RA, again there were many non-Muslims living in these lands, who were allowed to keep their religion - in fact their right to practice their own faith were protected under Islam! But these lands were ruled according to the rules of Islam only, and hence Islam was dominant or prevalent.

If you believe that Islam provides us with a particular political/governance system, then you necessarily believe that you may impose this system upon others. Being that this system supposedly comes from the direction of Allah, you are imposing your deen upon others, which is strictly prohibited from the Ayah in surah al baqara I referenced, hence the contradiction.

Walaykumusalam Please see the below extract from the English translation of Ibn Kathir's Tafseer of the ayah in question

ŸÑŸéÿß ÿ•ŸêŸÉŸíÿ±ŸéÿßŸáŸé ŸÅŸêŸä ÿßŸÑÿØŸëŸêŸäŸÜŸê ŸÇŸéÿØ ÿ™ŸëŸéÿ®ŸéŸäŸëŸéŸÜŸé ÿßŸÑÿ±ŸëŸèÿ¥ŸíÿØŸè ŸÖŸêŸÜŸé ÿßŸÑŸíÿ∫ŸéŸäŸëŸê

There is no compulsion in religion. Verily, the right path has become distinct from the wrong path.

ŸÑŸéÿß ÿ•ŸêŸÉŸíÿ±ŸéÿßŸáŸé ŸÅŸêŸä ÿßŸÑÿØŸëŸêŸäŸÜŸê (There is no compulsion in religion),

meaning, "Do not force anyone to become Muslim, for Islam is plain and clear, and its proofs and evidence are plain and clear. Therefore, there is no need to force anyone to embrace Islam. Rather, whoever Allah directs to Islam, opens his heart for it and enlightens his mind, will embrace Islam with certainty"**

I think this clarifies what the meaning of this ayah is, there is no need to twist it to suit the point you have previously made.

To be absolutely clear - this ayah forbids forcing a person to accept Islam and become a Muslim. There is no contradiction between this prohibition, and the vision for Islam and it's rules to be implemented and followed by human kind, across the world.

After all - why would the Creator of the universe send us rules that were not meant to be implemented? It makes no sense

The ayah is saying that you can't force someone to be a muslim. Not that you can't establish shariah in other lands.

Are you a hadith rejector btw?

You aren't imposing your deen on them. You aren't forcing them to become Muslim. Dhimmis exist for a reason. Your imposing the shariah of Allah upon them and ruling over them the way Allah told us to rule.

War is definitely allowed, the verse you linked disallows forceful conversion, as a person should believe to be a muslim. Taking over a land doesn‚Äôt mean everyone is muslim, the people converted (christians mainly) over the course of a few hundred years. Take this from now on as a chance to not speak without knowledge. Study Islam from a correct source, learn about wudu salaah for beginners (hadith) uthman al khamees in arabic, islamqa.info is good for laymen/hoenst answers. And when reading Quran, should you have a question or want to make sure before speaking use a tafsir. Tafsir ibn kathir (with regards to books containing history, the layman can‚Äôt distinguish the correct/incorrect and I‚Äôm not sure if everything mentioned in this will be authentic, I think the translated is specifically for laymen as to make it easier for readers who can‚Äôt tell) available on quran.com when on a verse click the book icon, first button top left slightly above the verse english, ibn kathir. ‚Äú Tadhkirat al-Huffaaz, p. 534.

This Tafseer is based on commentary by quoting texts ‚Äì verses and ahaadeeth ‚Äì and its fame is second to the fame of al-Tabari among later scholars. ‚Äúhttps://islamqa.info/amp/en/answers/43778

Also advice in general, idk if u identify urself as so. Don‚Äôt call urself a capitalist, socialist/communist, feminist or anything. I encourage you to study Islam. All these are self-admittedly man-made, so they‚Äôre 0 not the truth. They only see life as we live it and they‚Äôre inherently secular (not supporting of religion)

‚Äú... secularism, capitalism and other doctrines of infidelity is an apostasy from the religion of Islam." Salih Al-Fawzan. at-Tawheed.‚Äù

It‚Äôs also easier and a relief, some ppl spend hours a day arguing when someone at a slightly different political view (dem republican-western politics any) that they‚Äôd change in a months time. They push so hard to argue and ppl put themselves in the format to respond to them, and convince themselves to respond in such a toxic trap where they didn‚Äôt even care or agree with what they‚Äôre saying in the first place. All clearly against Islam anyways. You also keep your faith in check, the last thing a person wants is to be unsure if they‚Äôre considered muslim, especially when they pass.

Thank you for your kind words brother/sister.

As for the topic at hand,

War is definitely allowed, the verse you linked disallows forceful conversion, as a person should believe to be a muslim. Taking over a land doesn‚Äôt mean everyone is muslim, the people converted (christians mainly) over the course of a few hundred years.

If you are making the claim that conquering and offensive wars are permissible in Islam (it sounds like you are, correct me if im wrong), then when engagung in such a conquest, you are presumably acting on behalf of the authority and direction of the Quran, and not of your own personal volition or desires

If so, you are directly imposing your deen upon others, which is directly prohibited by Allah from the Ayah I referenced. To limit the ayah to the simple act of forced conversions is limiting the scope and depth of the ayah.

The latter verse was considered by many mufassireen to be abrogated by 9:73.

I can give you a much more intuitive and rational reason.

The message needed to be preserved, nurtured, and made available and easy to understand. This also explains how and why Islam is the last religion. Every other's prophets message was lost in the sands of time. Islam wasn't because of the conquests. The very idea of a single state warrants a single book and so on. The conquests and the preservation of the message are intimately linked. With modern printing press and the internet, Islam is available to anyone who is interested, and the Quran can not be modified or erased or forgotten now. But it wasn't soo. From the early days of Islam to the day the power centers of Christianity, and Zorostrianism got wind of what was happening in Arabia it was just a matter of time before they would have tried to snuff it out. It was a conquest for sure, but it was absolutely warrented and necessary for the preservation of the message..

The Ullama and Hafez preserved the message but only because they were protected and surrounded by the safety provided by conquests. It took 700 years after the conquests for any other army to even approach the borders of Islam offensively. It was really mostly infighting until Mongols taught us what's what. But by then Islam was pretty untouchable even the most violent and vicious oppressors of Muslims haven't been able to erase us :-).

There many valid and clear justified reason for who study the history of this period

Muslims empire was starting in the middle between two large empires which were fighting each other for hundreds of years Persian Empire on the east and Roman Empire on the north and west

They would not allow any new empire or any united power to show upon next to their borders and they always expanding toward each other and the Muslims in the middle

No way for Islam to be present today if not removing such two empires from power and war against Roman Empire start long back during prophet Muhammad PBUh life already when they wanted to invade Arab lands, to terminate new Islamic power showing up

Thank the lord for these conquests

who said the quran only preaches self defense?

Because the Quran allows offensive wars

https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/13xqbc4/-/jmk95oc

The whole idea is to raise the flag of Islam and to establish ALLAH Azawajal's word all over the world. That's why Islam is here, to rule the world with the commands of ALLAH azawajal.

Now that's extremely important because if the system is not of ALLAH azawajal, people will keep coming up with their own stupid objective definitions of good and right, the correct way to rule the public. And then of course all this corruption is done exactly because ALLAH Azawajal's laws have not been established on earth.

Don‚Äôt claim something the Quran didn‚Äôt explain or teach for using the word ¬´ the Quran only ¬ª you need to be sure‚Ä¶.here even without knowledge you can reject your claim : This is not an reply to the question, just you know that the Sahaba and the Prophet (SAWS) understood the Quran better than we will ever -> So either what you consider as conquest are permissible in it self or either it was all view as defensive (because Constantinople and Ctsesiphon start the war)

The Muslim state can declare war on those that have previously do so and that are in state of fighting the muslim.

The Muslim state can also declare war if a non muslim state plot an agression against the Muslim state (but we need real proof).

The Muslim state can declare war to save Muslim oppressed or killed in a non Muslim state

Then there is divergence about another point : The Muslim state can declare war against major non muslim power (according to one point), against non muslim that forbid the conversion to Islam (according to another opinion) and against any non muslim country (according to another opinion) -> Those three opinion refer to the same corpus of Ayah.

Do you have any evidence that the Quran supports the concept of a state at all?

The concept of a state is foundational to Islam. Here are two Hadith to explain the importance.

Messenger of Allah (Ô∑∫) said, "Banu Isra'il were governed over by the Prophets. When one Prophet died, another succeeded him. There will be no Prophet after me. There will be Khulafah, and they will be many." The Companions said: "O Messenger of Allah, what do you command us to do?" He said, "Fulfill the pledge of allegiance to them one after another. Concede to them their due rights and ask Allah that which is due to you. Allah will call them to account in respect of the subjects whom He had entrusted to them."

[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].

The Khalifah in this Hadith is clearly identified as a ruler on a state level for the Muslims, the way the Prophets previously ruled over Bani Isra'il.

Then in another Hadith he Ô∑∫ said:

When oath of allegiance has been pledged to two Khulafah, kill the latter of them.

This Hadith indicates that while the Muslims are commanded to pledge allegiance to a ruler who will be the successor of the Prophet Ô∑∫ in ruling over them, they can only have one ruler. This makes it clear therefore that the ruler over the Muslims - and therefore the state that he rules over - is one, singular ruler.

This is also clear from the actions of the Sahabah when they appointed Abu Bakr RA as the first Khalifah - originally there was a proposal for there to be one leader elected from the Muhajiroon and another from the Ansar, but this was swiftly rejected based on the understanding I had mentioned previously

We can certainly agree that the messenger peace be upon him was the living embodiment of Allah's words, and would never act in contradiction to them.

If you believe the messenger spoke those words as guided by Allah azzawajal, can you provide an ayah from the Quran that would act as guidance for such a belief (the establishment of an Islamic state)?

I don't understand your question - are you rejecting the validity of the Hadith's I quoted? Or do you think that they aren't relevant to this discussion, in which I case I would have to ask you to provide scholarly evidence as to their true meaning

The Qur'an uses the word ŸÇŸàŸÖ (group of people) which can mean state, tribe...etc.

Either invade them first, or wait for them to invade u

The main goal of Rasulullah (PBUH) was to preach islam to people as much as he can. To ensure more muslims he reached out to different tribal chiefs/leaders as through him(chief) most people would become muslims. Some accepted the idea and some didn‚Äôt. Those who rejected the idea sought each other out to form an alliance to annihilate islam. Moreover, muslims were being tortured and killed non-stop from day one. Considering all these reasons muslims had to take military approach along with conventional diplomatic approach. After the passing of our beloved prophet (pbuh), the tradition remained unchanged. If muslims really conquered other countries for the sake of land neither Salahdin Ayubi would spare a single christian during his conquest of Jerusalem nor there would be any hindus left in India after Moghusl ruled it for 235 years.

The quran doesnt only preach self defense.

There are many valid and clear justified reasons for who study the history of this period ; and they are defensive action and were mandatory to protect the Muslims

Muslims empire was starting in the middle between two large empires which were fighting each other for hundreds of years Persian Empire at the east and Roman Empire at the north and the west of the Arab Peninsula

They would not allow any new empire or any united power to show upon next to their borders and they always expanding toward each other and the Muslims in the middle

And in Quran, in chapter named ‚ÄúThe Roman‚Äù the God is saying in Quran:

Corruption has appeared throughout the land and sea by [reason of] what the hands of people have earned so He may let them taste part of [the consequence of] what they have done that perhaps they will return [to righteousness].

https://recitequran.com/30:41

People did suffer a lot during this period because of Roman and Parisian empire and The God sent Islam as a mercy to all the world

The God is saying in Quran:

And We have not sent you, [O Muhammad], except as a mercy to the worlds.(107) Say, ‚ÄúIt is only revealed to me that your god is but one God; so will you be Muslims [in submission to Him]?‚Äù(108)

https://recitequran.com/21:107

Also, No way for Islam to be present today if not removing such two empires from power and war against Roman Empire start long back during prophet Muhammad PBUh life already when they wanted to invade Arab lands, to terminate new Islamic power showing up

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expedition_of_Tabuk

Prophet Muhammad united the Arab for the first time in the history and created one nation worship only the God , the creator alone instead of idols worshiping; as the prophecy in Genesis 21:18 as the children of Ishmael become a great nation. And such united nation next to the border of Parisian empire and Roman Empire will be not be allowed and will be destroyed and the only valid defense action was to remove them otherwise they would keep fighting for hundreds of years to come

The above lecture by non-Muslims explain in details this period and actually how Islam save protected the people and give them freedom

And you will see that Muslims fight against the two empires, in the same time with much smaller numbers of soldiers because of was matter of life of death to the Islam and to the Muslims

From my impression, the pragmatic reason for the early Muslim Caliphate (the first four caliphs) was they didn't have borders that were defensible. Yes it was mostly desert. But the Byzantines had the ability to march down the Red Sea coastline and threaten Madina.

They and the Persians had been fighting each other for supremacy and the existence of a new unified state to their south was intolerable.

Thus the Muslims needed defensible borders and breathing room which they could only have by taking the Levant, Egypt and Persia. This way, the heartland (the Hijaz) was secured.

By the time of the Umayyads, though, the Arabs had experienced first hand how much wealth could be acquired through conquest. The Levant and Egypt were among the wealthiest regions in the known world. This partly incentivized the future conquests (North Africa, Spain etc).

Most territories where conquered without a fight intact places like Spain where in dark ages so they were more than happy to be ruled by Muslims .. another example in Asia where Muslim armed never went there they just accepted Islam because it was the truth and righteous religion
