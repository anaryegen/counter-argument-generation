Crime trends in London

Crime rates have increased in London, but the statistics paint a fairly complex picture. Rates, which provide insight into the total number of crimes, have grown at a steadier rate compared to the national average, but there are significant regional differences. One of the most important points to note is the increase in violent crime in the London region. London currently has the second-lowest rate of all regions in England and Wales. Despite this, case numbers are rising rather than falling, which is bucking the national trend. Rates of violent crime and sexual offences have decreased by over 5% across England and Wales. In London, they have risen by 6.7%. 

In addition to increases in violent crimes and sexual offences, these crimes are on the rise:

Theft: cases of theft in London have risen by 18%

Shoplifting: cases of shoplifting have increased by 41%

Robbery: cases of robbery have increased by 21%

The safety index highlights common concerns among Londoners, which include walking alone in the city after dark, worries about theft and burglary, fear of being attacked and concerns about drugs. 

Rising crime rates have an impact on how safe people feel when they live in or visit London, which affects the decisions they make. For individuals and businesses, it’s wise to be proactive in protecting homes and commercial premises by taking out robust insurance. Business owners should also consider investing in enhanced security measures to tackle problems ranging from violent crime and abuse to theft and robbery.
