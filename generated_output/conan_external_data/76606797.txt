International crime statistics indicate that in Islamic countries crime rates are lower than in other countries. This feature of Islamic countries is most often explained by two factors: a) the relatively low level of development, which has a positive effect on crime rates, and b) the strictness of Islamic penal law. Providing some evidence, this article maintains that the first fac-tor fails to explain properly the difference in the crime rates of Islamic and non-Islamic countries at a similar level of development. It also argues that the second explanation is a reductionist one. Following a Weberian ap-proach, the article develops the argument that the content and structure of Islamic belief and practice is the dominant shared element among Islamic countries. It has given rise to a particular socio-cultural structure among Muslims, one of the impacts of which has been the low crime rate. Islamic beliefs and practice, therefore, are discussed as the main explanatory factor for the low crime rate in Islamic countries.

... First, UN statistics show that the Middle East and North Africa region (UN-Habitat, 2007, cited in Shehayeb, 2010 and the Islamic world

(Serajzadeh, 2001) have one of the lowest crime rates in the world (despite the anecdotal evidence on low crime rate, crime data might be unreliable in the Arab world -see Laycock, 2014). Not only might this low crime rate impact the way in which criminology discourse is developed and shaped over time (see Young, 1988), it also does not stimulate criminal justice institutions to reflect on, and review, the effectiveness of their crime prevention practices and approaches. ...

... The Islamic religious values, 'which often overpower official and legal pronouncements', have been seen to be highly associated with the low crime rate (as in the case of Confucianism-related religious values in Asian countries: Shehayeb, 2010).

Serajzadeh (2001) argues that, irrespective of the development level, Islam forms a unique sociocultural structure that is responsible for the low crime rate (see also Helal & Coston, 1991;Qasim, 2018). In a comparison study, Alfaraj (1995) found that the number of three crimes (rape, homicide and theft) is lower in Saudi Arabia than in the State of Michigan in the USA. ...

... However, Islam's interest in social, cultural and religious values should not be seen as hindering the development of crime science in the Arab world. Indeed, the 'comprehensiveness' of Islam and its engagement in all aspects of the private and public life of Muslims (see

Serajzadeh, 2001) is as a feature that can potentially contribute to the progress of crime science. Sharia (Islami law) has been characterised as 'a living body of law that looks after the needs of Islamic society' (Hakeem et al., 2012, p.10). ...

Criminology and Crime Science in the Arab World

Khaled S. Al-Rashidi

Throughout most of the twentieth century, Western criminological thought was preoccupied by theories of modern criminology, which were concerned with the question of why individuals commit crime. Since the late 1970s, however, the Western world has experienced new reconfigurations in the crime control field, one of which is the transformation of Western criminological thought. New crime theories have emerged in which the focus has shifted from the ‘criminal’ to the ‘criminal’ activity. Despite their importance, these developments have had no impact on the criminological thought in the Arab world, which is, to this day, is dominated by Western theories of modern criminology. This paper has three purposes. First, it discusses the status quo of criminology in the Arab world. Second, it suggests plausible explanations that help understand the current status of criminology in this region. Third, it discusses the relevance of some criminological developments (notably crime theories and environmental criminology) in the Arab context. In that eventuality, it argues that the Western developments might bring insightful crime prevention lessons for the Arab world.

... In particular, research on religiosity as an antidote to crime in former Soviet Union republics is scarce; this lacuna in the literature is surprising considering that under Communist rule, religious participation was discouraged and restricted (Herlihy 1993;Johnston 1993). Similarly, little is known about individual-level effects of religiosity on criminal probability in Islamic countries, even though adherence to Islam is often assumed to be a cause of low crime rates in those nations (Neapolitan 1997;

Serajzadeh 2001). ...

... There seems to be even less exploration of the effects of personal religiosity on criminality in Islamic countries, despite the fact that adherence to Islam is often assumed to be related to the lower crime rates found in those societies (Neapolitan 1997;

Serajzadeh 2001; but see Groves, Newman, and Corrado 1987). A few studies report significant negative effects of religiosity on maladjustment or minor deviance in samples of Indonesian youth (e.g., French et al. 2008;Sallquist and Eisenberg 2010) or adolescents in one predominantly Muslim area of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Klanjšek, Vazsonyi, and Trejos-Castillo, 2012). ...

... Religion is a ubiquitous part of Islamic cultures; relative to Christian cultures there is less separation between secular law and Islamic religious decrees. In addition, Islam is said to foster low criminality through the development of strong external and internal controls

(Serajzadeh 2001). Islam also emphasizes submission to divine will and individual accountability for all worldly behavior to an even greater extent than does Christianity, and Islamic culture is intolerant of common criminal behaviors, as reflected in relatively harsh Islamic penal law (Evans and Scott 1984;Prothero 2010;Serajzadeh 2001). ...

Does Religion Suppress, Socialize, Soothe, or Support? Exploring Religiosity's Influence on Crime

A negative association between religiosity and crime is commonly documented in the United States and other Western contexts. In this study, we examine associations between religiosity and criminal probability among randomly selected survey respondents in a non-Western Christian context (Lviv, Ukraine) and a non-Western Islamic context (Dhaka, Bangladesh). In addition, we explore whether religiosity is associated in these contexts with various theoretical mechanisms identified in prior research, including self-control, social control, moral beliefs, negative emotions, and social support. Results confirm that religiosity is negatively correlated with projected criminal probability in non-Western contexts as well as among both Christian and Muslim respondents. Furthermore, net of social and demographic characteristics, religiosity appears to indirectly influence crime through moral beliefs and, to a lesser extent, through self-control and informal social control.

For example, Helal and Coston (1991) investigated crime rates in Bahrain and concluded that low crime rates in that country are related to their strict Islamic laws and social controls.

Test of Impacts of Gender Equality and Economic Development on Sexual Violence

Austin and Kim (International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology 44, 204–221, 2000) tested the relationship between gender equality and rape victimization by employing an international data set. The current study advances Austin and Kim’s (International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology 44, 204–221, 2000) work by employing more variables, such as absolute measures of female socioeconomic status and Muslim and Latin American regional indicators. Additionally, the current work utilizes a larger and updated international data set from The United Nations’ Surveys on Crime Trends and the Operations of Criminal Justice Systems. The results of multiple regression analyses partially support backlash hypotheses, but not the amelioration hypothesis. An interesting finding of this work is that developed countries display a higher level of sexual violence than their developing counterparts, which is inconsistent with the perspective of the civilizing process on violence. Additionally, Muslim countries register lower sexual violence than non-Muslim ones, while Latin American countries exhibit higher sexual violence than non-Latin American ones.

... This situation is evident in the low crime rates in Muslim majority countries compared with other countries (Fish, 2011). In fact, the content of the religion (i.e., Islam) that Sharia is based upon, rather than Sharia itself, has been shown to contribute to the low crime rates in Muslim majority countries (Fish, 2011;

Serajzadeh, 2001). Any prohibitive effect of the Islamic penal law or Sharia on crime can be traced back to the content of Islam (Serajzadeh, 2001). ...

Corporate Liquidity: Evidence from Islamic and non-Islamic Countries

This study examines whether and how Islam has bearings on corporate liquidity (cash holdings). A review of 34,895 non-financial firms from 68 countries (12 Muslim majority countries and 56 other countries, which consist of 26 developing and 30 developed countries) from 1996 to 2011 reveals that cash holdings are lower in Muslim majority countries than in other countries, particularly developed countries. This phenomenon appears to be more pronounced when financial development is high or anti-director rights are weak in Muslim majority countries. The lower cash holdings in Muslim majority countries can be explained by the modifying effect of Islam and Sharia compliance (SC) on cash determination. Specifically, the negative effect of leverage on cash is stronger in Muslim majority countries than in other developing countries when financial development is high, financial structure is market-based, or national governance is strong in the former. Moreover, SC has a direct and negative effect on cash, which is more pronounced when financial development is low, financial structure is bank-based, or anti-director rights are weak in Muslim majority countries. Furthermore, SC negatively affects cash through growth opportunities and dividend payment. Specifically, SC weakens the positive effect of growth opportunities on cash when financial structure is market-based. SC also weakens the positive effect of dividend payment on cash, and such a modifying effect is stronger when anti-director rights are weak. Overall, the results suggest the uniqueness of the cash policy in Muslim majority countries compared with other countries.

... 3 Owing to the nature of this religion, where a significant emphasis is on community building and providing an identity to individual people in respect to their society, an Islamic ecology suppresses the rise of crimes that are prevalent in many individualistic western nations.

4 The dark world of crime has largely been considered male-dominated which is why sparse research exists on the phenomenon of female criminality. However, increased news of female-led offenses has urged scholars to probe the much-neglected area of female criminality too. ...

6. Women Involement in Crime in Islamic Siciety

The present study emphases on investigating the etiology of women's association in crimes and its belongings on their personal relations as well family members and kids during sentence. Each crime on the world adds in grief, and negative affect to the world, either it is committed by male or female. In Muslim community like Pakistan, that crime might be thought of female crimes goes past human observation as females are seen as pure and accommodating creature of God; loaded with adoration and joy. This investigation contrariwise features the horrendous side of female criminality in Pakistani society of Punjab Pakistan; particularly studying the cases of those females who were convicted of murder that is strictly forbidden in Islam. The present research proposed to clarify that socioeconomic and cultural factors i.e., Islamic society, low level of education, less implication of religious values, economically dependency and patriarchal system are the dragging factors which are forced the women to obligate crimes in Pakistan. The study depicts how anger builds up in innocent women with Islamic and religious values and no criminal background which has led them to commit

Religiosity and Deviance Among College Students in Türkiye: A Test of Ascetic Theory

Fatma Takmaz Demirel

Although an inverse relationship between religion and deviance is empirically well-established in the western context, previous studies on Islam and deviance conducted in non-western countries are limited. To address this gap in deviance research, we hypothesized that individual religiosity would be inversely related to deviance with the inverse relationship being more likely for ascetic than anti-ascetic or secular deviance. To test this hypothesis, we applied ordinary least squares and logistic regression methods to analyze data collected from 2,005 survey participants of a Turkish public university student population. Regression results provided partial support for the hypothesis, as we found that religiosity was inversely related to both ascetic and secular deviance. The observed inverse relationship is noteworthy in that it was found in an institutionally secular, Muslim country. Implications of our findings are discussed. ARTICLE HISTORY

For Muslims Islam is not only a matter of private life but a set of economic, political, social and legal doctrine affecting every aspect of social life and having pervasive social consequences, and giving very strongly a sense of moral community. ...

Historical Contribution of Islamic Waqf in Human Capital Development through Funding Education

Dr. Muhammad Tariq Khan

Islam being a complete code of life encompasses all aspects of a person’s personal and social life. Islam considers those as Muslims who submit to the will of Allah Almighty in all aspects of life. Islam is not merely a matter of private life and its worship system is not restricted only to a set of rituals, but has pervasive social consequences and develops a strong sense of moral society based on system of rules around center of universal concept of justice. Therefore, Islam proposed institutions with relation to justice, governance, cooperation and solidarity for achieving high economic growth and development. Achievement of development and growth of economy is fast in a society or country if it has developed human capital (human resource). Human capital is developed when education is imparted and facilities of health and sound life are provided to human beings. According to Islamic principles, if human beings cannot afford proper education in the society (or other facilities such as health care) then those who are well off endow their properties in Zakat, Awqaf (plural of waqf) and Charities for their better development and nourishment. These properties when endowed as Awqaf are deployed for propagation of education (knowledge, skills, training etc.) by establishing Madrassas (schools, maktabs, colleges, universities etc.) libraries, translating books, and conducting research. In Islamic society there were many Awqaf founded for establishing Madrassas. This paper is dedicated to discuss the development of human capital through education funded by Islamic Awqaf by reviewing literature.

Cross-National Examination of the Relationship Between Gender Equality and Female Homicide and Rape Victimization

VIOLENCE AGAINST WOM

This study is the first cross-national work to examine the impact of gender equality on both female homicide and rape victimization. The data set from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) was analyzed for 70 countries. Several gender equality measures were significantly and positively related to rape victimization, but were mostly not significant to female homicide. Findings for rape victimization were consistent with the backlash hypothesis, but such findings may be related to the limitations of police rape rates, such as different legal definitions and police-reporting behaviors across countries.

Migration, not migrants, is the problem: Delinquency among migrants and non-migrants in Switzerland and ex-Yugoslavia

The nexus between migration and crime has been studied over nearly a century across many countries from all continents. Research has concentrated on comparisons of migrants (or their offspring) with natives. Comparisons between migrants and comparable samples from their countries of origin have not been undertaken so far, however, because data were usually limited to the host country. The International Self-Reported Delinquency Study (ISRD-3, Enzmann et al., 2018) allows this gap to be overcome. In Switzerland, with its large immigrant minority – one student in two has roots in a foreign country – migrants of different backgrounds can be compared with native Swiss and with students who attend schools in ex-Yugoslavia where many migrants are from. We compare data on self-reported offences and victimization in the family collected through interviews with some 4000 juveniles in Switzerland and more than 6000 students of the same age in four countries of ex-Yugoslavia (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia, Kosovo, Macedonia). Native-born youths in Switzerland report fewer offences than their immigrant peers, including those from ex-Yugoslavia. Although differences between students from ex-Yugoslavia and other foreign countries are relatively small, juveniles in ex-Yugoslavia report far lower offending rates than immigrants of the same age in Switzerland. Their rates are similar or lower than among native Swiss students. Further, rates of physical punishment and maltreatment are higher among immigrants than among non-migrants in Switzerland and in ex-Yugoslavia. We conclude that cultural background is unrelated to delinquency and parental punishment, but the experience of migrating goes along with violence within the family and self-reported offending. Differences exist between various family constellations, students born or with at least one parent born in Switzerland committing fewer offences and experiencing less parental violence.

Does Religion make a Difference? Juvenile Delinquency in Switzerland and Four Balkan Countries. C. Bijleveld, P. van der Laan (Eds.), Liber Amicorum Gerben Bruinsma, Amsterdam: Den Haag: Boom criminologie 2017, 193-200

In this paper, several associations between religious affiliations, importance of religion and juvenile delinquency are presented. The data were collected, as part of the ISRD-3 project, in Switzerland and in four countries of former Yugoslavia. It was found that Swiss juveniles attach far less importance to religion in their everyday life than Balkan youths. However, Moslems in Switzerland are more attached to their religion in Switzerland than Christians. This difference across religion does not exist in ex-Yugoslavia. The results show that young Moslems in Switzerland are more likely to self-report minor, property, violent and cannabis-related drug offences than their Christian peers. In exYugoslavia, however, this association is reversed. Christians also more often report cannabis use than Moslems, both in ex-Yugoslavia and in Switzerland. The multivariate analysis is complicated by the fact that religion is obviously associated with migration and several other possibly important variables, including self-control that is remarkably stronger among young Protestants.

Religion and Social Health in Muslims

Because of the impact that social health has on individual, family, and community health, including mental and physical health, this chapter is particularly relevant to our discussions. We review research that has examined links between religiosity and social support, marital stability, marital satisfaction, marital intimacy, and spouse abuse, as well as compare Muslims and non-Muslims in this regard. We also review research on religious involvement, crime and delinquency, and research on religiosity and social capital (a measure of community health as expressed in terms of trust between neighbors, volunteerism, and degree of participation in government and community activities). The findings are surprising in many of these areas.

National Religious Affiliation and Integrated Model of Homicide and Suicide

The current study assessed the relationship between national religious affiliation and lethal violence by simultaneously examining homicide and suicide rates. The information on homicide and suicide rates for 124 countries came from the World Health Organization (WHO). Regression results suggested no significant difference in lethal violence between predominantly Catholic and Protestant countries, although Islamic countries revealed significantly lower homicide, suicide, and overall lethal violence rates than non-Islamic countries. Countries with a high level of religious heterogeneity are subject to an increased suicide rate. The implications of these findings were discussed.

Religiosity and Regional Variation of Lethal Violence: Integrated Model

The present study tested the impact of religiosity and region on lethal violence in 83 countries by applying an integrated model. The regression results provided support for Durkheim’s proposition that religious passion might lead to a high homicide rate in a society. However, religiosity was significantly and negatively connected to the suicide rate, suggesting that religious secularization is related to an increased national suicide rate. Finally, the Latin American region exhibited an elevated homicide rate, while North Africa and the Middle East displayed low homicide and suicide rates.

Does Islam deter crime in a secular Islamic country? The case of Turkey

‘Does Islam deter crime in a secular country like Turkey’ is the research question for which the current study tries to find a tentative answer. The data came from 619 undergraduate university students, 352 academic and non-academic staff at a public university and 498 shop owners in a small city in a Central Anatolian region in Turkey in 2010. The research on the relationship between Islam and crime is almost absent in the criminology literature. The findings of the correlation analysis pointed out that the impact of Islam on crime was more pronounced regarding alcohol use, and generally weak. More importantly, the results of the multivariate statistics showed that some religious measures deterred individuals themselves engaging in deviance and alcohol use. No relationship was found between Islam and violence.

Postmodernity, High Modernity and New Modernity: Three Concepts in Search of Religion

The aim of this chapter is to explore some of the paradoxes that occur in attempts to relate recent changes in religion to the advent of postmodernity, high modernity and new modernity.1 The starting point is that relatively few accounts of postmodernity and its variants have paid much attention to religion.2 This observation may appear to be a strange basis on which to build claims about postmodernity and religious change, but it is actually essential to the main theme of the chapter. For the argument will be that advocates of the idea of postmodernity and its variants face formidable difficulties if they attempt to make sense of religion. It is not therefore surprising that, in all the speculations about postmodernity, serious interpretations of religious phenomena are rare birds.

Determinants of crime rates in Latin America and the world: An empirical assessment

This study uses a new data set of crime rates for a large sample of countries for the period 1970-1994, based on information from the United Nations World Crime Surveys, to analyze the determinants of national homicide and robbery rates. A simple model of the incentives to commit crimes is proposed, which explicitly considers possible causes of the persistence of crime over time (criminal inertia). Several econometric models are estimated, attempting to capture the determinants of crime rates across countries and over time. The empirical models are first run for cross-sections and then applied to panel data. The former focus on explanatory variables that do not change markedly over time, while the panel data techniques consider both the effect of the business cycle (i.e., GDP growth rate) on the crime rate and criminal inertia (accounted for by the inclusion of the lagged crime rate as an explanatory variable). The panel data techniques also consider country-specific effects, the joint endogeneity of some of the explanatory variables, and the existence of some types of measurement errors afflicting the crime data. The results show that increases in income inequality raise crime rates, deterrence effects are significant, crime tends to be counter-cyclical, and criminal inertia is significant even after controlling for other potential determinants of homicide and robbery rates.

Khomeini and Criminal Justice: Notes on Crime and Culture

It requires little imagination to insert a character from the old American Wild West into the imagery of Khomeini's justice, with the exception that this hero would ride into twon with a gun instead of pen and ink, and would do his own enforcing. The simplicity and clarity of justice in both images surely tempts the romantic among us. The essential difference between the folklore figure and the Ayatollah Khomeini, however, is that the western hero depicts the uneducated, raw man of the frontier, bringing an innocence, a freshness to the uncivilized society of Wild West. He represents, really, a kind of 'human justice'-a highly optimistic and benign view of man's nature, yet a nature without God. Khomeini, on the other hand, depicts the opposite: a highly educated man, a man who stands for 1,380 years (or thereabouts) of learning, who represents not human justice, but divine justice. Once again we are confronted by the Western penchant for institutional solutions to social problems, whereas those of Khomeini's Islam are left at the individual level. Indeed, Khomeini's only concern at the institutional level of society is with one institution - that of the power of the politico-religious institution of Islam. Today, the apparent disorganization of his 'institution' belies the basic ethic of the Shiite sect. It depends on charismatic individuals for gobernment, not on institutions. Khomeini's men are not organization men. They government, their own men. When they are powerful, only justice and good can follow. And it's the same with Wild West Justice. But we know, of course, that this kind of justice can only happen at the movies.

Low Crime Rates in Bahrain: Islamic Social Control-Testing the Theory of Synnomie

Charisse T. M. Coston

This pioneer work builds upon the systems of social control (synnomie) developed by Freda Adler (1983). Its intent is to assess the low crime profile of Bahrain and in so doing to offer explanations for this country's low crime rates. While there is crime in Bahrain, this country appears to be the exception to the rule that rapid industrialization breeds high crime. The unique situation in Bahrain will be analyzed by: giving an overview of the country of Bahrain, examining recent crime statistics reported by official agencies in Bahrain, the United States, and in addition, the state of Vermont. The official sources of these data are not considered to be the most reliable indicators of crime, but they are the most comparable. Vermont is used for the comparison of numbers since it has an approximate population to Bahrain.Low statistics of the amount of crime are reported for Bahrain which form the foundation for this paper. This paper offers possible explanations of low crime by using as its base the theory of synnomie (the consistency of norm and values sharing); and summarizes the main points in this paper and draws conclusions which point in the direction for the future of Bahrain, its citizens, and incidences of reported crime as Bahrain continues with its mission of modernization.

Crime Rates and Legal Sanctions

Certainty and severity of punishment for crime are indexed for the states of the U.S., and are related to crime rates. Strong and consistent negative associations are observed between certainty of punishment and crime rates, while a negative association is observed between severity of punishment and crime rates only for homicide. Variations in crime rates by different degrees of certainty and severity of punishment are examined. The observed patterns are discussed and possible explanations are offered. It is concluded that sociologists must take the idea of deterrence seriously and seek to clarify the relationship between various characteristics of reaction to deviance and rates of deviance.

Religion and Delinquency: the Ecology of a "Lost" Relationship

Confusion has developed in the literature over whether religious commitment decreases delinquent behavior. In this paper we show that conflicting findings stem from variations in the religious ecology of the communities studied. In communities where religious commitment is the norm, the more religious an individual, the less likely he or she will be delinquent. However, in highly secu larized communities, even the most devout teenagers are no less delinquent than the most irreligious. This is why the initial studies found no religious ef fects on delinquency. Each was based on highly secularized West Coast com munities, and the results generalize only to similar communities in that area. Elsewhere in the nation, studies have found strong religious effects on delin quency. Using a national sample of sixteen-year-old boys from eighty-seven high schools, we show there is a very substantial negative relationship between religious commitment and delinquency in the great majority of schools-those schools in which religious students are a majority. But the relationship vanishes in the most highly secularized West Coast schools. The theoretical implications of these marked ecological effects are assessed.

Theories of Crime and Development: An Historical Perspective

Theories of crime have long assumed that increased criminality is an inevitable consequence of economic and social progress. In the 1960s, when criminologists turned their attention to the Third World, this view was accepted by scholars who built on modernisation theory, and it was left unchallenged by the dependency theorists who began studying crime a decade later. But historical studies of crime have now undermined this assumption; in many nations industrialisation, urbanisation and rapid social change have been accompanied by declines in crime. More studies of long‐term trends of crime and criminal law are needed before a necessarily complex theory of crime can be advanced that will replace the discredited theories now prevalent.

Human Rights and Islamic Revivalism

At a time when human rights are again becoming a potent part of international relations, one is entitled to ask to whose advantage the issue is being raised. One particular target seems to be Islamic ‘fundamentalism’, ignoring the wide varieties of religious and political views presented by contemporary Islamic movements. An attempt is made to identify the main divergent trends among these movements. The author warns that an uncritical use of the human rights issue as a weapon with which to beat Islamic movements only serves to aid state oppression in the Muslim world. Particular consideration is given to the position of non‐Muslims, and a dialogue is encouraged to clarify facts and fears.This paper was given as a lecture at a seminar on ‘Religion, Law and Society’ organized by the World Council of Churches in early November 1993 in Nyon, Switzerland

Does a difference make a difference? Comparing cross-national crime indicators

This study investigates the question of reliability among four widely used cross-national data sets by constructing an error framework that relates types of errors to uses of the data. The findings indicate that (1) for nation-by-nation point estimation, the four data sets differ by varying degrees, (2) for aggregate point estimation in cross-sectional descriptive and longitudinal descriptive studies, they are statistically similar, and (3) for analytic or explanatory cross-sectional purposes, they yield statistically and substantively similar results. In short, for studies seeking aggregate descriptions of world crime or analytic explanations of cross-national crime rates, differences in the data sets do not make a difference in the results.

This study examines the perceptions of the seriousness of offenses: first, by examining perceptions of a wide range of offenses for respondents from two very divergent cultures, the United States and the Middle East, second, by assessing the perceived severity of some 17 sanctions for respondents from these two cultures and finally, by assessing the impact of religiosity on the perceived seriousness of Crime. In addition, both the magnitude estimation and category techniques for measuring the seriousness of crime are utilized and the results from using these two techniques are compared.

The violence against Pasmanda Muslims in Azizpur-Bahilwara in Muzaffarpur cannot be understood as an instance of conventional communal strife between Hindus and Muslims. This report from the ground indicates that different layers of caste, community, administrative and patronage networks have played a role in fostering the violence but also in containing it.

CRITICIZE THE USE OF ANALOGY PROHIBITION IN CRIMINAL LAW

February 2015 · Mimbar Hukum - Fakultas Hukum Universitas Gadjah Mada

The analogy becomes an absolute thing that is not permitted under the Indonesia criminal law. However, in the moving and changing society, written criminal laws are not always able to accommodate all the crime that happened. The prohibition of analogy it is not in line with Islamic law, “qiyas”, which no other is the analogy. Analogy should be accepted as part of a form of interpretation that has ... [Show full abstract] been known in the criminal law. Ban the use of analogy also confirmed in the draft Criminal Code. However, reading the ban of analogy must be done carefully. Analogi menjadi satu hal mutlak yang tidak diperkenankan dalam hukum pidana. Namun demikian di tengah perkembangan masyarakat yang bergerak dan senantiasa berubah, perundang-undangan pidana tertulis tidak selamanya mampu menampung seluruh tindak pidana yang terjadi. Doktrin hukum pidana yang melarang analogi ini justru tidak sejalan dengan konsep hukum Islam yang mengenal qiyas, yang tiada lain adalah analogi. Seyogyanya analogi bisa diterima sebagai bagian dari bentuk penafsiran yang selama ini telah dikenal dalam hukum pidana. Larangan penggunaan analogi juga ditegaskan (kembali) dalam Rancangan KUHP. Namun demikian perlu kehati-hatian dalam membaca larangan analogi dalam Rancangan KUHP ini.View full-text

Historical Events and Spaces of Hate: Hate Crimes against Arabs and Muslims in Post-9/11 America

February 2011 · Social Problems

This research investigates variation in hate crime offending against Arabs and Muslims across U.S. counties in the months before and after September 11, 2001. Four questions are of particular interest. First, what were the determinants of anti-Arab and Muslim hate crimes prior to 9/11? Second, in what social contexts were Arabs and Muslims at greatest risk of victimization? Third, to what extent ... [Show full abstract] did hate crimes against these groups increase after the terrorist attacks? And last, did the predictors of hate crimes against Arabs and Muslims change appreciably after 9/11? Findings show that hate crimes targeting Arabs and Muslims increased dramatically in the months following 9/11, although the structural determinants and geographic concentration of these crimes remained largely consistent after the attacks. Negative binomial regression results further suggest that counties with larger concentrations of Arabs and Muslims have higher incidents of such hate crimes, which likely reflects the availability of targets for this type of offending. At the same time, the likelihood of victimization for a given Arab or Muslim person is lowest in counties where the percent Arab or percent Muslim is highest, in line with a power-differential perspective on discrimination and intergroup violence. The findings imply that terrorist attacks may indeed incite retaliation and set off a wave of hate crime offending, but the location of these crimes is likely to remain consistent after a galvanizing event.View full-text
