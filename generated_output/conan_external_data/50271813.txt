Open Police Force Data

Mapping and analysis of crime and safety data in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland

CrimeRate.co.uk is a data analysis and GIS project dedicated to uncovering crime trends in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. We aggregate open police force data, social media signals and file FOI requests with local police departments to build the most complete catalogue of crime and safety information in the region.

We are actively working to encourage more open data initiatives in the UK, since Greater Manchester Police have paused or failed to implement open data systems. Police Scotland also have roadblocks to effective use of FOI requests to access recent records.
