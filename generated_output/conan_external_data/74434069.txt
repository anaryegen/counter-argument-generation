Islamic Views on Western Culture

Islamic Views on Western Culture

by The Gallup Poll Editorial Staff

Majorities of residents in all nine countries surveyed in Gallup's Poll of the Islamic World say Western nations do not care about poorer nations, nor are they willing to share their technological knowledge with them. Residents also think that Western nations do not treat the minorities in their own countries fairly, and that Westerners have immoral lifestyles and weak family values.

When it comes to the way that Western nations treat Arab/Islamic countries, residents are even more negative -- they say Western nations do not respect Arab/Islamic values, do not support Arab causes in international organizations and do not exhibit fairness toward Arab/Islamic countries in general.

More positively, majorities of residents in four of the nine countries surveyed believe that citizens of Western nations do have equal rights and duties. Majorities of residents in five of the nine countries say that Western nations produce enjoyable films and music (although in three of the nine countries, Pakistan, Iran and Morocco, the vast majority of residents disagree with this statement).

Respondents volunteer these same sentiments when asked two open-ended questions: "What, if anything, do you, yourself, like best or admire most about the West?" and "What, if anything, do you, yourself, like least, admire the least, or resent about the West?"

Respondents are most likely to say they admire the West for its scientific and technological expertise, particularly in the area of advanced technology. In Indonesia, Kuwait, and Iran, more than half of those interviewed refer to the West's technological accomplishments, as do nearly as high a percentage of Jordanians and Moroccans.

Residents also express considerable admiration for the West's political values and structures. When residents of Lebanon and Turkey are asked what they find praiseworthy about the West, respect for human values, rights, freedom, and democracy are the most frequently occurring responses. Residents of Jordan and Kuwait also respond with these types of sentiments.

Smaller numbers of respondents identify other aspects of the West as admirable, including its level of economic advancement; its cultural appreciation of the value of time and (personal) discipline; the educational level attained by individuals in Western societies; and the creativity, reliability, and way of thinking characteristic of Western society.

The image that dominates respondents' negative perceptions of the West is clear-cut: the immoral lifestyles, a weakening of family structure, a decline in social courtesy, and the loss of traditional deference to elders in Western nations. Over half of those interviewed in Jordan, Lebanon, and Kuwait mention these types of negative social influences as the aspect of the West they most resent, as do large numbers of Pakistanis and Iranians.

Additionally, a significant number of respondents resent what they perceive as negative Western attitudes toward Muslims generally or Arabs specifically.

Still others mention resenting what they perceive to be a high rate of alcohol and drug abuse in the West, coupled with high rates of crime, violence, and corruption.

Completing the list of the most frequently volunteered sources of resentment of the West are perceptions that Westerners:

are arrogant and believe their societies and civilization are more superior and advanced

are excessively prone to interfere in the internal and political affairs of other nations

are insufficiently attached to their own religion, religious beliefs, and ethnicity

Iraq and the West: How Wide Is the Morality Gap?

The tumultuous events of the past decade have repeatedly strained the relationship Iraqis have with the West. Is a perceived "morality gap" between their own society's values and those of the West also a point of stress in that relationship?

Stereotypes of Young Islamic Men Challenged

A Gallup poll of seven predominantly Islamic countries finds that young men (under age 30) in these countries are not more likely than older men, nor women in general, to support the terrorist attacks in the United States on Sept. 11. The results from some countries show that women are more likely than men to oppose the attacks, but in some other countries, the reverse is true.

Measurement Issues in the Nine-Country Gallup Poll of the Islamic World

The 2002 Gallup Poll of the Islamic World has raised interesting questions about measurement in survey research and social science. We have received inquiries about the degree to which the attitudes we measured in these predominantly Islamic countries reflect access to certain government-controlled media. Along these same lines is the question about whether or not the respondents are “telling the truth.” These are important questions that we also hear in relationship to our polls conducted in the United States. They seem to come down to a very general and basic question: Just what is it that we are measuring in polls?
