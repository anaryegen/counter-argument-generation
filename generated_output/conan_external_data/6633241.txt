Sharia Law in Europe

Islam's Sharia law is cast from the words of Muhammad, called "hadith," his actions, called "sunnah," and the Quran, which he dictated. Sharia law itself cannot be altered but its interpretation, called "fiqh," by muftis (Islamic jurists) is given some latitude.

As a legal system, Sharia law is exceptionally broad. While other legal codes regulate public behavior, Sharia regulates public behavior, private behavior, and private beliefs.

Compared to other legal codes, Sharia law also prioritizes punishment over rehabilitation and favors corporal and capital punishments over incarceration. Of all legal systems in the world today, Sharia law is the most intrusive and restrictive, especially against women. According to Sharia law (see the links for details):

• Theft is punishable by amputation of the hands (see above and Quran 5:38). • Criticizing or denying any part of the Quran is punishable by death. • Criticizing Muhammad or denying that he is a prophet is punishable by death. • Criticizing or denying Allah is punishable by death (see Allah moon god). • A Muslim who becomes a non-Muslim is punishable by death (see Compulsion). • A non-Muslim who leads a Muslim away from Islam is punishable by death. • A non-Muslim man who marries a Muslim woman is punishable by death. • Homosexuality is punishable by death but sodomizing boys is fine (see Islam & Sex). • Girls' clitoris should be cut (Muhammad's words, Book 41, Kitab Al-Adab, Hadith 5251). • Girls can be sodomized until and vaginally raped after 8 years of age (see Islam & Sex). • A woman or girl who has been raped cannot testify in court against her rapist(s). • Testimonies of 4 male witnesses are required to prove rape of a female (Quran 24:13). • A woman or girl who alleges rape without producing 4 male witnesses is guilty of adultery. • A woman or girl found guilty of adultery is punishable by death (see "Islamophobia"). • A male convicted of rape can have his conviction dismissed by marrying his victim. • Muslim men have sexual rights to any woman/girl not wearing the Hijab (see Taharrush). • A woman can have 1 husband, who can have up to 4 wives; Muhammad can have more. • A man can beat his wife for insubordination (see Quran 4:34 and Religion of Peace). • A man can unilaterally divorce his wife; a wife needs her husband's consent to divorce. • A divorced wife loses custody of all children over 6 years of age or when they exceed it. • A woman's testimony in court, allowed in property cases, carries ½ the weight of a man's. • A female heir inherits half of what a male heir inherits (see Mathematics in Quran). • A woman cannot speak alone to a man who is not her husband or relative. • Meat to eat must come from animals that have been sacrificed to Allah - i.e., be "Halal." • Muslims should engage in Taqiyya and lie to non-Muslims to advance Islam. • Continue...

Which countries use the Sharia law?

Muslims' aspired Sharia state is the birthplace of Muhammad that has no legal code other than the Sharia law and enforces it without mercy: Saudi Arabia. But as detailed below, the Sharia law is also used in full or in part, nationally or regionally in:

United Arab Emirates

United States (USA)*

United Kingdom (UK)*

W. Bank & Gaza (89%)**

* In the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and other European countries that resist the Sharia law, it has proven adept at infiltrating elements of the society that are left vulnerable (see Sharia law in America and Islamization of America).

** Percent of Muslims who favor making Sharia the official law in their country (source: Pew Forum Research). In many countries where an official secular legal system exists alongside the Sharia law, the majority of their Muslim citizens favor making Sharia the official law. For example, while Egypt's military blocked the Muslim Brotherhood's efforts in this direction in 2013, 74% of Egypt's Muslims still favor it. Even in Jordan, Indonesia and Malaysia - Muslim countries with progressive images - the relatively secular ruling elite sit atop Muslim masses, 71%, 72% and 86% respectively of whom want their countries to be ruled by Sharia. And in Iraq, where the United States has been propping up democracy since 2003, 91% of its Muslims want to live under the Sharia law.

The number of countries penetrated by Sharia law continues to grow, as does the depth of its penetration in the countries already affected. This penetration is not by happenstance; it is managed to occur in five phases: see Spread of Islam and the 10 steps to Stop Islam.
