UK: Muslim Rape Gang Survivor Reveals That Up to 500,000 Non-Muslim Girls May Have Been Raped by Muslims

Jul 25, 2020 3:00 pm By Faisal Malik

Ella Hill is a survivor of a Rotherham Muslim rape gang. Recently she was interviewed on Triggernometry, a British interview and discussion program run by two comedians, Konstantin Kisin and Francis Foster. During the interview, she revealed that Muslim rape gangs may have sexually abused as many as 500,000 non-Muslim girls over the last forty years. The victims were particularly white girls, but there have been many other victims as well, such as Sikh girls.

This is unbelievable. It is a national scandal which politicians still fail to mention. Many argue that the number of victims abused by Muslim rape gangs actually exceeds one million, but even if Ella Hill is correct and there have been only half a million victims, that is bad enough. Many more survivors of these “grooming gangs” are now speaking out. Their cases are unbelievable, as they explain how the Muslim gangs tortured and intimidated young non-Muslim girls.

The UK Home office has still failed to publish its report on the “grooming gangs.” Its reason for keeping the report under wraps most likely involve the fact that the rape gangs were made up of the wrong perpetrators, and targeted the wrong victims, for the mainstream narrative.

Furthermore, Ella also emphasised the fact that when she was abused by the Muslim rape gang, authorities and police did not even care in the slightest, because they feared being called ‘racist’ for doing their job. The scandals that have been exposed in numerous cities are horrific. The failure of the police is horrendous. Another survivor, Sammy Woodhouse, stated that when she was raped by Muslims, the police arrested her while she was in bed with the rapist, instead of arresting the rapist. That is how shocking this rape jihad is.

In this interview, Ella also mentioned that her rapists were ‘religiously motivated’. This is a key fact which many people, particularly Britain’s corrupt MPs and police continue to ignore.

The Koran advocates the rape of infidel women and girls numerous times; see verses 4:3, 4:24, 23:6, and 33:50. It also emphasises that Muslims can have sex with underage girls; see surah 65:4. These Muslim rape gangs have proliferated in numerous cities is because of Islamic ideology. This fact has been concealed by the elites, such as the Muslim former prosecutor Nazir Afzal. He denies that the perpetrators were committing their evil deeds because of Islam. He must know that this is a complete lie.

White non-Muslim girls that have been predominantly the targets because of another belief which originates from Islam, that white sex slaves bring a higher reward to their owners. Mohammed had a white sex slave called Miriam a Coptic Christian. This practice has been emulated all over the Islamic world through fourteen centuries of jihad. Even the supposed Islamic Golden Age in Spain included Muslims taking sex slaves, because they were emulating Mohammed.

It is absolutely disgusting how the authorities have allowed this to happen for decades.

The vast number of sex assaults and outright rapes against the British girls and women in the United Kingdom has been strongly linked to the large number of male Muslim migrants may serve as an example of Muslim ungratefulness and unthankfulness for letting them enter England to live. This this further exposes the Muslim’s Islamic contempt for people who are Westerners and Western civilization, Western laws.

This Muslim violence may be yet better explained by one of the fables of Aesop which is entitled THE FARMER AND THE VIPER. So here it is “Once in ancient Greece there was a farmer outside on a very cold winter day walking in if field to make sure that everything is in order and as it should be. The farmer came upon a half-froze viper about to die from the bitter cold. The kind yet foolish farmer took pity on the viper and in an action of kindness put it his is vest jacket to warms and up and thus save its life. The viper warned up revived and then bit farmer through the vest jacket. So the kind but foolish farmer died a slow painful death in awful agony because he felt sorry of the viper and saved it life. The point to this fable is the no amount of kindness will change and vicious and evil nature, they have this evil nature because of their violent,misogynistic religion.

So it is with those Muslim migrants who were allowed to enter UK to live . Those violent migrants who are Muslims will not be impress and change because kindness of Westerners. This is because those violent Muslims have that ungrateful dangerous viper nature because of their venomous and violent religion which is Islam.

Jul 25, 2020 at 4:42 pm

So you than antimuslim racist is saying all muslin male are rapist. What about white christian who rape than color muslim does that mean all christian male are rapist.

Jul 25, 2020 at 6:00 pm

What claptrap from “Brian Hoff”–really, “DefenderofIslam”.

These Muslims are raping on the basis of their faith–Muhammed himself was a rapist, and he is considered the “model man” for Muslims. Islam teaches the rape of Infidels and their use as sex slaves. This is *not true* of Christianity.

Moreover, “Brian Hoff” himself has crowed over how he will be able to “get women” once Muslims take over the United States. Sounds like sex slavery to me.

Jul 25, 2020 at 9:33 pm

To Brian Hoff. thank you for taking the time to reply to my posting. to answer your statement , I never keyboarded that all Muslim males have committed the sin and crime of rape . Nevertheless, because of the misogyny of Islam as well as Islam’s spirit of contempt for “disbelievers” a considerable number of Muslim males living in Western nations have committed rape.

As for Christian men committing the sin and crime of rape ,well I known cases of Christian men who have acted inappropriately towards women but I have never known of areal, ,genuine, Christian man committing rape. Only false “chrtistan” men have committed rape.

Jesus taught “Not everyone who says to Me ‘Lord, Lord ‘shall enter the kingdom of heaven ,but he who does the will of My Father in heaven.” Matthew 7;21.. [N.K.J.V.]

Committing the sin of rape is ,very much, against the will of God the Father.

Jul 25, 2020 at 10:42 pm

In Judaism, rape was punishable by expulsion & death. In Christianity, punishment was expulsion and death. In Islam, rape was celebrated.

You assume that the UK government actually gives a damn about their native peoples’ children. That’s where you are wrong.

Where and when I grew up, this type of incident might have happened once. The police would NOT have been notified and the miscreant might not have been found for weeks or months – depending on the tides.

Jul 25, 2020 at 10:46 pm

I have recommended that the hunters, soldiers, vigilantes shoot for the zipper. Israeli and European friends smile and agree. Only the left cringes.Latent paedos?

Jul 25, 2020 at 4:52 pm

It all comes back to the queen and the rest of the royal pedos. They care nothing for anyone

Jul 25, 2020 at 9:46 pm

What makes you think the Queen is a pedophile? Citations, please.

That being said, she *should* be speaking out against the threat of Islam to her people.

Jul 26, 2020 at 12:50 am

Gi, I agree totally. Many would say that the Queen cannot speak out against such outrages, because she should remain above politics. But this scandal is above and beyond what any decent person would regard as ‘just politics’. It is a crime against humanity – the product of a hateful, misogynistic ideology masquerading as a religion.

The Queen is also supposed to be the Defender of the Faith – ie the Church of England – once the foremost protestant Christian denomination – but which now kowtows to Islam. I’m sure the Queen is a decent person, but by remaining silent, what faith is she defending, Christianity or Islam?

Jul 26, 2020 at 1:11 am

Agree, Aussie Infidel. If the Queen cannot speak out to protect her subjects, then what use is the Royal Family?

And note that her Father the King *did* famously speak out against Fascism and the Nazis.

Jul 26, 2020 at 5:35 am

The queen is a powerless figurehead, I agree. But Jasper is right about the ones in power actively enabling pedophiles. Even prince Andrew was caught lying about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and his visits to the infamous “pedo island”.

Face it, you absolutely CANNOT deny the fact that there is something much more rotten deep down in the UK aside from just muslims being muslim and police fearing being called “racist”. Other European countries have muslim infestation problems and PC politics, but the child rape gangs are NOWHERE NEAR as well-organized, protected and widespread as in the UK (not saying they don’t exist in other countries, but their number and “effectiveness” pale in comparison). Not a single day goes by without JW featuring at least one article about the UK and it’s muslim child rape gangs. You of all people should know that.

Jul 26, 2020 at 8:11 am

Yes Gravenimage, the King did speak out against the Nazis. But only after the Government had declared a state of War. Not before.

The previous April the King had sent Hitler a congratulatory telegram for his 50th birthday. On the advice of Chamberlain’s appeasement administration.

Despite appearances to the contrary, the King was a mere tool of the elected Government.

His brother Edward VIII attempted to break the rules, to act aside from advice. Mrs.Simpson was a heaven-sent excuse to get rid of him.

Jul 26, 2020 at 9:49 pm

Actually, Rufolino, the speech was made the day that Britain declared war against the Fascists.

Jul 25, 2020 at 5:10 pm

Muslims just being muslims The only scandal here is that it is allowed to continue by non muslims Non muslims are to entirely to blame

Please help Dr Ella Hill’s work … Thank You https://www.paypal.me/ellahilluk

Jul 25, 2020 at 6:13 pm

Half a million is about 1% of the population of England. “1%” might sound small, but it isn’t. If that estimate is true…

Then factor in that it’s only girls (well, not quite, as Lord Ahmed of Rotherham can attest, but nearly), that it’s only girls in a certain age range (although I suppose that range is broadened over time, these attacks having been going on for over forty years, as can be attested by, er, Lord Ahmed of Rotherham), and that those girls in places that haven’t yet been enriched by Moslem colonisers, or at least those that live too far away for easy travel by Mercedes, are relatively safe (although the young girls of Furness might disagree), and “half a million” would suggest that a rather large proportion of vulnerable young girls have indeed been raped by Moslem rape gangs.

In truth, I find it hard to credit that the number of young women abused by Moslem rape gangs could be as high as half a million. Perhaps I’m mistaken about that – but there’s no doubt the number is obscenely high and a stain on the nation that permits it. My nation.

Jul 26, 2020 at 2:38 am

Lord Ahmed of Rotherham was, I believe, the specimen who killed a motorist on our M62 motorway when illegally texting at the wheel of his 4×4 car at 70 mph or so, and got off with less than a week in prison courtesy of his friends in convenient places. If not, it must have been a different ‘Lord Ahmed’ from the same part of the world?

UK: Muslim Rape Gang Survivor Reveals At Least 500,000 Non-Muslim Girls Have Been Raped by Muslims …………………

Just horrifying–Ella Hill is a very brave young woman for coming forward. And more cases come to light all the time.

How many are ongoing?

Feliks J. Kwiatkowski says

Jul 25, 2020 at 10:01 pm

The commentary by Mr Malik misrepresents the interview. It needs to be re-worked to preserve the reputation of JihadWatch. Dr Ella Hill in fact stated that the numbers could ‘possibly be’ half a million over 40 years. I did not see any sufficient justification for that number in the interview. Further, the lady appeared under a pseudonym. While we can give credit to her individual account, I cannot give credence to that number, even over 40 years, without some concrete substantiation, and nor should this website.

Jul 25, 2020 at 10:18 pm

According to the Independent, there were 18,700 children who were victims of sexual “grooming” in 2018 as reported by local authorities. This figure would add up to over half a million in thirty years–so this figure for forty years is actually rather conservative.

Noting this fact in no way endangers the reputation of Jihad Watch.

Jul 25, 2020 at 10:34 pm

Yes+. Quibbling about how many tens of thousands per year is irrelevant … as any number of religious condoned rapes is not acceptable in civilized society. A religion that condones this is not a religion.

Jul 25, 2020 at 10:52 pm

Muhammed was in early fifties when he raped Aisha and had the blessing of Aisha’s pappa. Aisha was his cousin. Family Values, in Mecca.

Jul 25, 2020 at 10:48 pm

graven image and rubiconcrest – Accuracy is always important, numbers are >not< just a quibble. And I am not convinced that the official definition of 'grooming' matches with the legal definition of rape. I repeat – the interview itself made no sufficient attempt to justify the number, and the JW piece misrepresents what the interviewee actually said.

Jul 25, 2020 at 11:06 pm

The article above notes that there are no hard numbers that have been released–but extrapolating from numbers that *have* been released this figure seems quite plausible, and may as noted be even higher.

And your idea that “grooming” has nothing to do with sexual abuse is simply mistaken:

“Sexual grooming: what is it according to UK law?”

Sexual grooming is the process by which a person with a sexual interest in children builds an emotional connection with a child to gain their trust for the purposes of sexual abuse, sexual exploitation or trafficking.

Jul 26, 2020 at 7:04 am

Obviously you are a rape apologist. You are sickening. Your quibble about numbers gravely misses the point, but then again you are a muslim sycophant.

Feliks J. Kwiatkowski says

Jul 26, 2020 at 8:42 am

Mr Wade- You are seriously mistaken about me. I believe that JW does honourable, necessary, work. It is precisely because of this that I believe JW should not provide a soft target for our enemies by sloppy journalism such as is displayed in the above report on the Hill interview. I shall repeat here what I have said elsewhere- with Islam, the simple truth is damning enough. There is never a need for exaggeration, guesswork or invention. Do you understand that our enemies can wave this report in the face of the ignorant public, and use it as a tool to discredit the truthful and measured reports that are habitually set out on this website?

Jul 26, 2020 at 9:03 am

Feliks J. Kwiatkowski,

“Grooming”, in and of itself, is not rape – but it usually leads to rape.

This has been shown to be true with the muslim “grooming gangs” in the UK.

Agreed, the actual “round” number of “500,000” rapes cannot be independently verified.

What can be verified, is that thousands and thousands of rapes occurred involving muslim men and non-muslim girls in the UK over decades.

And it all could have been prevented…

Jul 26, 2020 at 9:49 am

Yes it does lead to rape, I have first hand experiences& now they are becoming so ‘gallus’ ( a scottish word for both fearless&arrogant personality) that asylum seekers are even starting their own gangs. In my city alone there was a scandal which involved 55 of them . But Scottish government hush hush it like everything else. Within the month of june in my city : 16 year old violently raped in a park, 15yr old boy sexually assaulted in a bus stop, young teenage girls were approached & harassed for sex in park by 2 foreign nationals.. the prior 2 involved a black man & another foreign nnational.The MSM are silent. That is what we know about. A convenience store near me had to close as the pervert Pakistani owner was attempting to groom teenagers & took advantage of a woman with learning disabilities. I suggest you look up wolfpack hunters UK; this paedophile hunting group in Glasgow has on camera on the site many muslim/refugee men ‘ caught grooming children online’ yet the press & government say nothing. They have actually been given a 2 year banning order from operating stings. Guess who the justice secretary for Scotland is? Humza Yousef. Coincidence? Google them – wolfpack hunters UK, (I don’t have a Facebook but you can still access their site & watch their ‘stings’. Now the reason is, I am dumb struck as some of these men are asylum seekers & openly admit only in country 3 months etc.. another ex asylum seeker is driving a taxi & arrives to have sex (rape) a 13 year old girl. Plenty of foreign nationals caught & Scotland is supposed to be a very small country? What’s the chances? One even slips up on camera stating he’s not an Iraqi but infact from Kuwait. Yet these dangerous rats are not deported? It’s an epidemic in the United kingdom, every town/city has big problems. And poverty, familial issues etc are a problem in the UK thus these girls & boys are carefully targeted. It’s no coincidence they groom runaway& problematic children but nobody’s children are safe. I suggest you also view the drama ‘three girls’ on YouTube, it depicts the story of some of the girls of the rochdale scandal& Maggie oliver the whistleblower. It’s a BBC drama which surprised me a lot. As it is factual within the courtroom scene, eg what the perpetrators said on the stand it depicts every DISGUSTING word against these ‘white girls’

Jul 26, 2020 at 2:31 am

The UK Government commissioned a report into the muslim Grooming Gang scandal a year or so ago. Then they sat on it and refused to publish it, and, when pushed on the matter, said that it was because of ‘community cohesion’. Then they either threatened with court proceedings or actually taken to court, and the latest they said was that they would publish ‘later in the year’ with some sort of ‘strategy for action’. What they mean is, they’re in a very deep hole and want time to try and ‘edit’ it or come up with some way to cover the fact that they’ve been guilty of either epic gross negligence or/and criminal complicity with muslim agencies here and abroad, they want to try and cover their tracks (and won’t be able to) and try and whitewash themselves with some sort of remedial action that’s way too late.

Also, all this talk of ‘community cohesion’ is fatuously farcical.if they’re trying to pretend that the UK in any way, shape or form represents one national ‘community’ anymore. Each ethnic minority has its own ‘community’.and most of them are in varying degrees incompatible with ‘English’, Welsh’, ‘Scottish’ or ‘Irish’ culture and values, probably never knew anything about the indigenous cultures before they came, have never shown any interest or attempted to lerarn about or rintegrate with them (because that’s not why they came), and often have never even bothered to learn the English language! So the authorities tried to paper over this mess with a load of contrived hogwash about ‘diversity’, when in fact ‘diversity’ in realitty means the depraved, antediluvian criminal cesspit that we now see exemplified by this ‘Grooming Gang ddbacle.

Henry Mansfield says

Jul 26, 2020 at 8:44 am

Even though I’ve read that the groomers used ‘Romeos’ near the intended victim’s age and concentrated on victims in the state social services network of group homes it boggles my mind that this wasn’t the #1 topic of discussion in every beauty shop and barber shop on the island for the last 4 decades. I live in a metropolitan area of 2.5 million people, so it’s not exactly a small town. Were so and so’s 13 year old 3rd cousin thrice-removed being picked up by grown Muslim men, always seen in the company of Muslims and disappearing for days at a time with Muslims little else would be discussed. Here in the USA, police stations are burning right now over protests that have gotten out of hand. If young children were the cause I doubt many police would even attempt to ‘man the barricades’.

Jul 26, 2020 at 11:39 am

Time for the UK to purge its soil of Islam.

France needs to follow, especially after this:

https://www.yahoo.com/news/rwandan-refugee-put-under-formal-055453817.html

The word “refugee” is being bandied about just like “racism” and “Islamophobia” and at some point needs to stop. More and more people are seeing through the Liberal-owned media as being nothing more than a LIE of Satan.

Jul 26, 2020 at 1:05 pm

Sounds kind of like the racist rape gang, raping mostly white girls and women. I’ll bet if these criminal rapist where white instead of muslims the media would have this on the front page and lead story on TV. all over the world.

Jul 26, 2020 at 1:24 pm

The hatred over religion is seen in all comments. Please stop generalizing a crime on religion. Islam or any other religion has been misread and misjudged, words are twisted as all who read- understands them as their brain processes it. Those who rape or do crimes are criminals not Muslim, Christian, Jew, Hindu etc. No religion preaches it. Don’t know how can anyone quote religious manuscripts to justify their comments? You are simply twisting the words.

Jul 26, 2020 at 9:29 pm

As far as I know Muslim is not a religion. And yes islam is and it promotes violence against women and child marriage, that’s rape in and of itself. These muslim rape gangs are exactly what you claim criminals and not to be excused because of their ethnic background or religion. If they were British rape gangs I would call them British rape gangs.

Jul 26, 2020 at 10:12 pm

The hatred over religion is seen in all comments. …………………..

How is pointing out that sexual “grooming” of children in the UK is almost entirely a crime committed by Muslims wrong? How is noting that the rape of Infidels is sacralized in Islam wrong?

and that IsPlease stop generalizing a crime on religion. Islam or any other religion has been misread and misjudged, words are twisted as all who read- understands them as their brain processes it. Those who rape or do crimes are criminals not Muslim, Christian, Jew, Hindu etc. No religion preaches it. …………………..

The “Prophet” Muhammed raped Infidel captives and sex slaves, and indeed teaches the rape of Infidels. The reference in Qur’an 4:3, 4:24, and 33:50 to “what your right hands possess” refers to sex slaves.

And in the Hadith, the “Prophet” Muhammed castigates his thug followers for *not* raping their captives:

Abu Sirma said to Abu Sa’id al Khadri (Allah he pleased with him): O Abu Sa’id, did you hear Allah’s Messenger mentioning al-‘azl? He said: Yes, and added: We went out with Allah’s Messenger on the expedition to the Bi’l-Mustaliq and took captive some excellent Arab women; and we desired them, for we were suffering from the absence of our wives, (but at the same time) we also desired ransom for them. So we decided to have sexual intercourse with them but by observing ‘azl (Withdrawing the male sexual organ before emission of semen to avoid-conception). But we said: We are doing an act whereas Allah’s Messenger is amongst us; why not ask him? So we asked Allah’s Messenger, and he said: Do you really do that? It does not matter if you do not do it, for every soul that is to be born up to the Day of Resurrection will be born. Sahih Muslim 8:3371

Don’t know how can anyone quote religious manuscripts to justify their comments? You are simply twisting the words. …………………..

How would this poster pretend to interpret these scripture? Of course this is sacralized rape.

Rob R (Brit stuck in Britainistan) says

Jul 26, 2020 at 6:31 pm

If we’re gonna call rape “grooming”, why not just call murder “tanning” while we’re at it? And genocide is “slimming”.

For a person who actually pays attention to what’s going on, living here is unbearable. Obviously, for most Brits, they are either ignorant of it or engage in twisted denial. “Oh, the Daily Mail just made it up” and they get rid of the horrible boogeyman called “truth” by spitting such curses as “far-right” and “conspiracy theorist!”.

To me, experiencing the “personality” of the average Brit, is like being drenched in baby spit.

At this point of proceedings I would never *ever* attempt a conversation with an average Brit about these cases, or attempt to wake them from their trance. It’s not worth the trouble.

Jul 26, 2020 at 10:13 pm

So troubling to hear, Rob–but I have heard this before.

Aug 10, 2020 at 12:39 pm

“White” people have accepted a lie and then the same people will turn a blind eye to what this lie leads to. It is heart-breaking that a once noble people have given up their moral standards. This is but one of the outcomes – that a girl who is seen as white then becomes a whore for any man. Where is the LOVE that God intended for a people – gone….
