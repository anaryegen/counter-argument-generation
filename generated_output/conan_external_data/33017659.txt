Muslim-only swimming sessions 'never existed'

Muslim-only swimming sessions 'never existed'

Croydon Council scraps Muslim dress code at swimming pool after uproar

A council says no dress code ever existed forcing people to cover-up during swimming sessions.

Croydon Council says the rules to force swimmers to cover up for fear 'of offending Muslims' during the sessions at Thornton Heath Leisure Centre had been misinterpreted. And the centre does not run 'Muslim-Only sessions'.

It re-worded the advice on its website after criticism over its policy 'to refuse entry to those who did not comply with the dress code'. Articles suggesting people were being 'forced to cover-up' appeared in a range of national newspapers.

Its website said: “During special Muslim sessions, male costumes must cover the body from the navel to the knee and females must be covered from the neck to the ankles and wrists.”

The council claimed it was an error and no dress code existed.

The centre runs women-only sessions on Saturday afternoons and men-only sessions on Sundays.

A Council spokesman said: “Thornton Heath Leisure Centre does not run Muslim-only swimming sessions. Single-sex sessions are held for women on Saturday afternoons and for men on Sunday afternoons.

"These are for people who may not feel comfortable swimming in a mixed-gender group.

"There is no dress code enforced by centre staff at either of these sessions.

"They have been running for several years, and have proved very popular with people from a wide range of backgrounds.

“We apologise for the confusion caused by incorrect wording on one of our web pages, which may have given the impression that sessions were not open to all faiths.

"This wording has been amended, and we want to be quite clear that entry to swimming sessions has never been restricted on the grounds of religion.”

But when the the Norbury Islamic Academy, which runs the Muslim Fitness Programme at the centre were contacted they insisted there was a dress code.

Its website continues to warn users: “When attending, please adhere to the Islamic dress code (otherwise you will be refused entry).”
