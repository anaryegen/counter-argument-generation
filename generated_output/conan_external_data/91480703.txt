A question for those who pray in public in non muslim countries

How do you do it? Don't you think people with look at you or even disturb you? Can it be seen as an act of showing off your religion and piety instead of keeping it private? I'd like to hear your thoughts on this please.

Alhamdullilah, I’ve had no incidents happen to me thus far. To be honest, it’s set and stone that people will look st me while I pray. And for me, acknowledging this thought in a way relieves me of any anxiety or stress about being exposed

It’s hard to explain, but for me, I pay no heed to the environment around me (I.e footsteps, ambience, etc.) and it helps me maintain khushoo during Salat

Finding a private corner with minimal and even no public appearance is key. Otherwise, you’d be prone to losing concentration

And at the end of the day, wether people think it is for showing off or not, Allah azawajal knows my intentions; I worship Him at the appointed times as best as I can

Was about to type exactly what you've said, but you've saved me the effort!

My first step is to purify my intentions, and realise within myself that I am about to talk to Allah awj... everything else automatically fades to the background :-)

May Allah accept our prayers, and allow us to meet Him in peace.

In Muslim majority countries where this is more commonplace in wondering about women. The argument for praying in public en masse is it happens so often so don’t always have an indoor place to do so. However I’m photos of Muslim majority countries I just see huge crowds of men in the streets praying. Where are the women? Are they not allowed or is it that there is in fact indoor space for them. I’m which case is this prayer historically outdoors to really help spread the religion?

I’m fine with it but just an observation I’m curious to validate.

To be honest, I am more afraid of missing my prayer than ppl’s watchful eyes. I just pick a place that’s convenient and pray. Also i guess it is a form of dawah.

Edit: I would like to add, if I felt unsafe, I would be patient and choose a place to safely pray according to the sunnah of the prophet Muhammad pbuh. In Canada I have no issues but I wouldn’t do it somewhere like China.

why you have so many downvotes?

I think people think I’m making fun of them or making fun of someone I’m not entirely sure.

But really I was just excited at how everyone is boldly stating that you should just pray, don’t be afraid, what Allah thinks of me is more important than what people think of me, etc. And it is, like motivational and reaffirming the fearless side of Muslims.

And so my “This” is like an empathetic (emphatic from American dialect point of view) response of what everyone is saying is right kinda thing.

However I can see why they might interpret it another way unfortunately.

Look here is the thing. We have to pray. No ifs and or buts about it. People will always have a problem with someone. I gotta do what I gotta do. In the end I genuinely don’t care what others think. Obviously I am considerate. I pray in a spot that’s not blocking others. Most of the people don’t care anyways.

This reminds me when I was in the US it was weird and anxiety inducing for me at first, but after a while I don’t care and only care for my obligations to Allah. I’m here just to share my experiences I am not a perfect muslim I have a lot to fix in my life but I’ll try my best to not miss Salat. If there’s anything that I can say to every Muslim out there is never abandon your Salat please even if you think you have huge sin do your Salat it’s an obligation not a suggestion.

I pray I reach your level of confidence In Shaa Allah.

There is Allah and then there's everybody else.

InshAllah you will. Start off by making Dua’a

akhi i have started praying in school and allhamdullilah my fate has already increased tons, used to only feel a muslim at home but now I feel like a real muslim. Still very nerve wrecking and concentrating is hard, may Allah still accept my prayers and make it less nervous

I am a woman and a convert.

im in the USA. I pray in public often because when its time to pray you pray. Its awkward, but normally my husband is leading the prayer even in public so I feel less anxious. But I do it by myself too. I just carry prayer rugs in my SUV. Ive prayed on a beach, parking garage, in front of a grocery store, next to a waterfall, etc, you name it. I know some people say women shouldn't pray in front of people, but personally I think if you gotta do it just do it.

Sometimes I feel like people are judging me, then I remember im going to be the one judged by allah one day, and thats more important.

There is no ostentation in performing an obligatory action.

What are you talking about, of course there can be. Whatever prayer, obligatory or voluntary, is judged based on their intention, which should be solely for worshipping Allah. Any other intentions would make the prayer void.

Praying in public doesn’t make me uncomfortable, as I’m try to find a lesser crowded place, but being seen while doing whudu is, especially if you’re cleaning your feet.

I was once in the gym and had to doo wudhu in the gym and had my feet in the sink to clean my feet, while someone (most likely non-muslim) saw me.

When it comes to praying as far as possible I dont leave the house without wudhu, I’ve got my praying mat with me and as far as possible I try to find the nearest mosque (I’m living in germany). If the time left isnt enough, I try to find a less crowded place or a corner and do my salah. What is sometimes weird or makes me uncomfortable, is asking whether I can pray at the gym for example in a empty room etc.

I had one of those, but I got sweaty feet and the ones I saw are pretty thick and make me sweat even more.

why do some schools allow wiping over socks and other don't, how do you know what to follow? Whenever I do wudu in public I just wipe over them but scared my wudu is invalid by all these different opinion

I've had no problems, alhamdulillah. Every now and then when I've been out and about, and I'm unable to pray at home or a nearby masjid in time, I'll find a local park, find a quiet spot under a shady tree, and pray. Never been bothered. Even at work when I'm at a construction site, I'll find a part of our site where we're not actively working, strategically park my car between myself and where anyone would be looking at me , and pray. Simple.

Can it be seen as an act of showing off your religion and piety instead of keeping it private?

It's all about intent. If someone makes it a point to pray in the public right of way where others have to go around them, or film it for social media likes, that will be on them to explain when we're all ultimately called into question about our prayers.

“I fear the day when the disbelievers are proud of their falsehood, and the Muslims are shy of their faith” - Umar ibn al-Khattab (RA)

So let me tell you a story.

Before I converted I was I fighter. The region I grew up in didn't like outsiders. That's why I became very aggressive and at the same time hate every racist person.

At this time I remember a Muslim man and his Christian woman (who isn't an outsider) 45+ got attacked in front of their house by 4 people. They beat them up just because he was Muslim. (they never saw him do anything they just heard from other people) one of them was his far neighbor and his parents told him.

When I figured that out I began a rampage. (I was their age and wouldn't let something like that slide) Even in school the Believers got some problems. They would ask me for help and I would help without asking for anything.

Now I am a convert. SubhanAllah. I am extremely conces about that. I have no problem saying to people that I am Muslim. But the "normal" people already attack me with words because rasicem is just normal around here. But I will stand my ground. the times when I prayed in public I had multiple people try to jump me. These people weren't just random by passers (but can easily happen as well) they already made conversations with me and liked me up until the point where somebody said I am Muslim. Then I wasn't human anymore.

I don't know if I can explain it. I know when I start praying in public (at least in my region) it will come to fights and I have kids. I would kill the person who kicks my door in at night. Because I would expect them to be there to kill my family.

I am really happy that so many here have an easy time praying in public. I know when I visit other places that it is easier. But there are places where you would refrain from doing it in public. Actually never saw a Muslim doing it in public my whole life (expect if I did it)

Her we see Muslims getting attacked

in public, Refrain from judgment about your brothers and sisters if you don't know. First ask them what'going on and try to help.

As for the disbelievers yeah they're proud.

Holding on to the religion feels very difficult at times. Not because I don't believe. But always these attacks, discussions, judgments and difficulties. Really annoying to explain to someone, after they thought they like you, that you're still acutely human.

I don't know how to explain this. I don't know.

Salem Alaykum Brothers and Sisters. Tomorrow I start working again so I won't be seen here a lot anymore.

Where are you from? Is your country made up of multiple religions?

Some of the Sahaba in Makkah used to purposely pray in a visible place so the mushrikeen would see it, I don’t think this is the same as showing off

That's them actively spreading their faith. Serves as an announcement and also to pique curiosity.

It’s literally one of the easiest ways of doing passive Dawah. Muslims need to be seen in public being Muslim and not hidden in the shadows and corners of society out of sight of the public.

Significant-Jello-35

Just returned from Korea 2 weeks ago. At one point, we prayed while at the train station. Found a hidden spot and not blocking anyone or anything. We took turns and prayed. No one even bothered to look at us.

Another experience that made me started to use non white or fully black prayer garb. I was on training in a country. I went up to pray at an empty training room and came down after. Later I heard commotion amongst colleagues that someone spotted ghost a few hours earlier. They replayed the cctv and lo and behold... That was me praying!!😁.

Hence forth, if in public, I dont put on white or black prayer garb. Even in my office, I use colored ones to avoid anyone from getting a heart attack thinking they hv seen a ghost! 😊

As someone who’s has prayed in public areas a few times not counting inside a car, it can be nerve racking I won’t lie it’s why I try to avoid it often but when I do I think it’s important to remember that yeah your gonna get some looks but I have never had anyone bother me about it. I pray in public when I have no other options.

In the end how I deal with it is that you have to realize is that people only stare because their confuse or curious if they feel uncomfortable they’ll leave and most people usually don’t care and just go about their day. It’s also a basic logical rule that as long you pray in a place that won’t disturb anyone then people will leave you alone.

The Shaytaan whispers to him that he is showing off so that he will give up doing acts of worship

Just as the Shaytaan comes to the Muslim to make him admire his actions and show off to people, sometimes too he uses the opposite trick and makes a person think that he is showing off, so that he will not do it.

In order to avoid both problems, we have to make sure that our intention is sound and make it sincerely and purely for the sake of Allaah, and not worry after that about anything that the Shaytaan may come up with.

Ibn Muflih al-Hanbali said – in a chapter on “We should not give up prescribed actions for fear of showing off”: One of the things that may happen to a person is that when he wants to do an act of worship, it occurs to him that he should not do it for fear of showing off.

What he should do is not to pay attention to that. He can do that which Allaah has commanded him to do or encouraged him to do, and seek the help of Allaah, and trust in Him that he will do it in the manner prescribed in Islam.

Shaykh Muhiy al-Deen al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: You should not give up remembering Allaah verbally and in your heart because you think you may be showing off, rather you should remember Him in both ways, seeking thereby the Face of Allaah. And he quoted al-Fudayl ibn ‘Iyaad (may Allaah have mercy on him) as saying: Giving up a good deed for the sake of people is also showing off, and doing it for the sake of people is shirk. He said: If a person opens the door to noticing people and worrying about what they think then most of the doors to goodness will be closed to him.

Abu’l-Faraj ibn al-Jawzi said: With regard to not doing good deeds for fear of showing off, if the motive for doing that deed is other than religious, then he should not do it because it is a sin. But if the motive for that is religious and it is sincerely for the sake of Allaah, then he should not refrain from doing it, because the motive is religious. Similarly if he does not do a good deed for fear that it will be said that he is a show-off, then he should ignore that because it is one of the tricks of the Shaytaan.

Ibraaheem al-Nakha’i said: If the Shaytaan comes to you when you are praying and says, “you are showing off,” then you should make it even longer. With regard to the reports narrated from one of the salaf, that he stopped worshipping for fear of showing off, this is to be understood as meaning that they felt that they were showing off, so they stopped it. And that is indeed the case. For example, al-A’mash said: I was with Ibraaheem al-Nakha’i when he was reading Qur’aan, and a man asked for permission to enter, so he covered the Mus-haf. He said: So that he will not think that I read it all the time. So if you should not stop doing an act of worship for fear of showing off, it is more appropriate that you should not stop it for fear of self admiration that may occur later on.

Al-Adaab al-Shara’iyyah, 1/266-267

Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked:

When a person thinks of doing a good deed, the Shaytaan comes and whispers to him: “You want to do that to show off and have a good reputation,” so he backs off from doing that good deed. How can we avoid this?

That can be avoided by seeking refuge with Allaah from the accursed Shaytaan, and going ahead with the good deed. You should not pay attention to this waswaas (whisper from the Shaytaan) that puts you off doing good. If you turn away from this and seek refuge with Allaah from the accursed Shaytaan, the problem will disappear, by Allaah’s leave.

Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, question no. 277

And Allaah knows best.

When I was younger I was so confused how people seemed to know I was a muslim even though I never told them nor was I wearing my thobe or prayer cap. When I got a bit older I realized it was because I was a brown guy with a beard so it was pretty obvious already 😅😂.

After thinking about that I told myself look people already know your muslim already, might as well be a good proud muslim, which gave me a bit more bravery to do things like pray in public, or talk openly about Islam when I thought it was a good opportunity to do dawah.

Just learn to not care. My wife is from rural georgia, so I see her family often. We go to pray and I just pray where ever and then find a more private spot for her. I've been honked at. I went to a fencing tournament and I prayed on between bouts and this guy walks in, and goes "oh! Yoga?!" And I'm silent ofc, not bad, mainly just funny but yeah

Not going to lie, I've struggled with this. My wife alhamdulillah has no issue praying in public.

For some reason, idk why I get uncomfortable but I first try to find a private place Otherwise I just do it.

In secular countries public display of religiosity is a very strange thing

Most people don’t care. There is always places that is barely noticeable by anyone

I goto a store and pray in the dressing room.

Grab a few pairs of clothes so it looks like your taking a while to try them on, that way you don’t need to rush your prayer.

If possible I'll find secluded clean place to pray or else in public eye. If we worry about what kuffar think, we can never practice the dheen.

I find doing wudu as been the bigger challenge. Dont want to take off shoes and socks in public restroom. Now i just use a bottle of water for the entire wudu. Used proper sometimes theres still some left in the bottle after

I did pray in public (forest, parking lot, ...) People just look at you, they are probably curious (I live in France so People almost never see Muslims pray).

The only People who told me négative comment are Muslims themselves. Such as:

You are a girl, this is not allowed to pray in public (which is wrong by the way) You don't need to put yourself in such trouble, you can do them all at night.

Or they just have a look of "disgust" (I didn't find another word to say it) if you tell them you are going to pray in such a place.

Also, yes, I was scared sometimes. As I live in France, and in a very racist place (in the past) I was scared someone would come up to me.

I live in a country that has more muslims population than other religions. The comment section really opened my eyes. With you guys having a hard time praying outside and still not missing a prayer, comparing to me with mosques everywhere and still miss the prayer because “we’re outside”. This really touched me. Really makes me want to change.

Pray in the grass if your traveling.if your not pray in the masjid.

That is a great question. I pray everyday at school in a room at my school with Muslim friends. Conveniently enough, the room is all glass and people sometimes pass by it. I don’t get interrupted at all. If somebody was to ask me what I was doing, I’d tell them and wouldn’t be afraid. It’s a little annoying however having people seeing you, but it’s not something embarrassing at all.

When I had a job where i was unable to pray at. I used to pray in the biggest park in my city (kind of like Central Park but with a lot more people per Sqm.

I did it next to a tree away from people's walking paths.

I honestly wish I could build up the courage to do it again because that honestly gave me the sweetness of iman as I've never felt since.

I’m more concerned about missing my salah because that’s what I’ll be questioned about by Allah. I try to always wear a jacket or something so I can use it to pray on when I’m out in public.

Can i add- please be careful praying right beside ur parked car on the adjacent parking bay.

I almost hit someone when i tried to park in his adjacent bay because he was doing sujood and i never saw him.

I have lived in the city and the suburbs so I have seen ppl poop, pee, drink, and have sex in public. Obviously, I’m not going to go in the middle of the intersection and start my daily prayer. However, I feel like once you get to a certain age you realize not many people care at all about what you’re really doing and most just mind their business. At my college I have prayed usually in a quiet corner, or a stairwell or a study room in the library or the meditation room. No one really cares.

I try to find a spot where it's private. Away from noise, traffic, comfortable, not dirty and SAFE. This is my time with Allah and there is always a place that i can find that fit those criteria.

I've travel to at least 20 non-muslim dominated country and currently live in one. I always do a bit research beforehand and plan my travel according to prayer time (ie finding if there is mosque around, a park nearby, or even coming back to my room/house to pray.

i’m not muslim i’m just learning, but from someone who lives in Canada a non-muslim country, on plenty of different occasions i’ve walked in on muslims praying whether it be at work in the change room or at school or something. it doesn’t really matter to me I just try to be quiet & respectful and leave the space if I can so they can feel comfortable. so I don’t feel like it’s seen as showing off or annoying , most just mind their business

Who gives a damn? In America there’s a whole concept about individual freedom. You have the freedom to live your life how you like and do what you want to do. And everybody else a responsibility to respect it. If I feel a need to connect with my God I can just find a corner and start praying. And people will walk by, look for a second, and then forget I’m there. And then I leave. And nobody cares.

I have done it hundreds of times. You're not making a big scene. It takes 5 minutes or less often. Passers-by may be curious. It may invite them to search about Islam. It's a great thing to get used to. Imagine if the 7 million Muslims in the US regularly did this. It'd be really cool.

Find an isolated spot if possible. Keep one of those foldable plastic prayer mats with you. If there’s no suitable place then I just pray in my car and try to park it facing the Qibla. It’s not about show off it’s about fulfilling a an obligatory act of worship. People looking should have no bearing on it. We’ll be answering for our deeds not for what people think of us.

If you mean people that stop and pray in the middle of public spaces then I don’t understand but I live in Australia and we make do all the time, my friends and I regularly pray in whatever space we find, we’ve prayed in parking lots, behind film displays in the cinema, parks, beaches, museums etc. Never been disturbed before or felt weird about it.

A Christian at my gym admired a Muslim's (not me) dedication

I'm living in Germany and I've prayed countless times in a park, in the shopping streets or on the sidewalk. People certainly look a bit confused but as long as you're not blocking any entrances you should be fine.

The thought of showing off has never crossed my mind. You pray because you have to, as long as you’re not an impediment to others, it doesn’t really matter. But also check your surroundings prior and be careful, there are some parts in this country where I’m sure people would give you a problem

Almost every comment is about how it makes you feel personally. I don’t think a single one of you said how it can affect other people. I think that is the issue. Personally I don’t care as long as you’re not in my way and not disturbing me. But there have been times in my life where I did not want any reminders of God, and I know other people feel the same. People struggling with their own connection with their God could find it very disturbing. And who knows it may even help some people to reconnect with God. But I don’t think it’s anyone’s place to flaunt their religion. Religion is a very very personal thing. I understand that you need to pray and fast at certain times, but not give any concerns about how others around you may feel isn’t right.

ServantOfTheGenerous

I just don't care if they look at me, if anything I'd like to normalize it. If people aren't going to physically attack you then I don't see any reason not to pray

Finding a good place makes it much easier. But in the end if you're confident you get away with a lot without being overly questioned.

Find a place where you aren’t disturbing anyone who’s passing through the area. My school has no proper prayer room so I pray on a platform where the stairs end (all the way at the highest floor because less people come to the highest floor).

Sometimes 1 or 2 people pass us while praying but as long as you’re focussed it shouldn’t be an issue.

I make sure I am not blocking the road, and not bothering anyone. I have had people go out of their way to walk around me and see what I am doing, a couple of stares ( I think out of curiosity) , but that is pretty much it.

The issue I have is, how did I know the direction of Qibla in public?

Just look at where the Sun is and pray in the general direction. That is if you don't have internet or a compass.

You can download an app that will tell you where the qibla is based off your gps position. You'll find plenty of those apps.

Me and friends have prayed on beaches and sidewalks in Miami , we choose a sidewalk that was not obstructing and people can still walk because it was wide , two males and followed by two females while praying That was really great feeling to know you can pray anywhere you want without obstructing anyone and keeping off from filthy area

Our group has even prayed in parking lots of hotels and restaurants, I try as best to pray not in car when I’m public only if I found a suitable place else car is fine

Make sure you don’t do this always and do it only where there are people around , hate crime is a reality and anyone can be a victim . If you feel safe then pray outside else pray in your car , or at a parking space far away from every one.

I just dont caring about what people think and thats what works for me

What is a non-Muslim country? You mean Muslim majority country? Very few country in the world follow sharia as constitution.

Normally I find a quiet place like an empty parking lot or something. But if there are no options I just pray at the first spot I see. Most annoying thing that happened to me was that someone was walking his dog right next to me praying. But at the end of the day who cares. U just pray for the sake of Allah and if you’re left with no choice but to pray in public then it’s a privilege. It’s only an act of showing off if that’s your intention. Allah knows best.

Personally, I try to find a place that nobody would really bother me. Sure, I get looks but nobody disturbs me Alhumdulilah.

Nope, people here don't think it's showing off.

Privacy is one thing. But doing your obligations is another.

If you do something for the sake of Allah but pray more (or perfect your prayer) because people are watching, then you're sinful.

If you do something for the sake of Allah but don't pray because people are watching, then you're also sinful.

So keeping acts private is good, but you can't leave the act because you're afraid of being public. You're doing it for Allah, nothing should matter.

And coming to back to your question. Prayer is obligatory so you gotta pray no matter what. If you're sincere in praying, then Allah will show you a way to pray (whether in public or elsewhere). Find a clean, safe, place somewhere and pray.

You know people don't really care as much as we do. We think the people are really mad that we're praying or worshipping Allah, but it's just nothing to them. They will walk past you. Don't worry.

I always think about how the Sahaba were said to have prayed during battle, and this motivates me to think, if they could do that, what are peering eyes gonna do to me?

I live in Canada. Find a place, preferably a corner or less crowded area, and do whatever you want ?! No one should ask or be bothered, I never had a problem with that at all. And you shouldn’t be worried about what people think, just focus on what you need to do

shaytan likes to play the shiekh role sometimes and tell you its showing off. if you are going to miss prayer, and ur intention is merely to pray to please your lord and not show off, you will be fine. It does feel awkward if im praying and someone walks by but who cares. usually im not in the way and no one says anything. one time i was praying in front of a door (i didnt realize people needed to use it) and someone just walked around me to use the other door.

It's not much of an issue tbh. Just find a corner in which you aren't inconveniencing anyone, put down your prayer mat, and pray. Most likely nobody thinks much of it. Even if they do think, who cares?

I’m usually praying in a public gym and I just grab a sauna room that’s empty, no one usually cares because it’s not like I take forever. Few minutes.
