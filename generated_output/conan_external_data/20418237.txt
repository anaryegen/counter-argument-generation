Thirteen reasons why Islam is a disgusting religion.

You may be wondering why Muslims behave as they do. You probably think that the kind of people that blew up the trade center are extremists that are carrying their religion much further than was ever intended. But this is not the case. Terrorists don't create themselves in a vacuum. The terrorists stand on the shoulders of the militants; the militants stand on the shoulders of the ordinary Muslims and they all stand on their religious texts. The answer to why Muslims behave as they do can be found in the Quran and well as in the texts that describe the life and sayings of their prophet Mohammed - the Hadith. And while I have limited myself to examples from Islam's own texts, it should also be understood that the violence that has been done by Muslims and continues to be done by Muslims, every day, around the world, is not the exception, but the rule. Those who think that Muslim radicals do not represent the average Muslims need to take a close look at Palestine where the majority population just electect some of the most violent, bigoted, and murderous people on the face of the earth to be their leaders.

******** 1.Islam is disgusting because it is imperialistic.

Mohammed's purpose in inventing Islam was to constantly increase his power. All of his actions were designed to grow Islam. And of course, anyone who became a Muslim fell under his control. The imperialistic objectives of Islam to conquer and control the entire world are clearly

spelled out in these examples.

Quran: [9.29] Fight those who do not believe in Allah, nor in the latter day, nor do they prohibit what Allah and His Apostle have prohibited, nor follow the religion of truth, out of those who have been given the Book, until they pay the tax in acknowledgment of superiority and they are in a state of subjection.

[8.39] And fight with them until there is no more persecution and *** religion should be only for Allah;*** but if they desist, then surely Allah sees what they do.

Sahih Muslim Book 019, Number 4366: It has been narrated by 'Umar b. al-Khattib that he heard the Messenger

of Allah (may peace be upon him) say: I will expel the Jews and Christians from the Arabian Peninsula and will not leave any but Muslim.

Sahih Muslim The Book of Faith (Kitab Al-Iman) Book 001, Number 0033: It has been narrated on the authority of Abdullah b. 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah said: I have been commanded to fight against people till they testify that there is no god but Allah, that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah, and they establish prayer, and pay Zakat and if they do it, their blood and property are guaranteed protection on my behalf except when justified by law, and their affairs rest with Allah.

Sahih Bukhari Volume 4, Book 53, Number 392: Narrated Abu Huraira: While we were in the Mosque, the Prophet came out and said, "Let us go to the Jews" We went out till we reached Bait-ul-Midras. He said to them, "If you embrace Islam, you will be safe. You should know that the

earth belongs to Allah and His Apostle, and I want to expel you from this land. So, if anyone amongst you owns some property, he is permitted to sell it, otherwise you should know that the Earth belongs to Allah and His Apostle."

Here is evidence that Mohammed wanted his men to use their women as baby machines so that his power would increase.

Abu Dawud Book 11, Number 2045: Narrated Ma'qil ibn Yasar: A man came to the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) and said: I have found a woman of rank and beauty, but she does not give birth to children. Should I marry her? He said: No. He came again to him, but he prohibited him. He came to him third time, and he (the Prophet) said: Marry women who are loving and very prolific, for I shall outnumber the

******* 2. Islam is disgusting because it is bigoted.

Religious bigotry has always been a curse to mankind, and Islam's bigotry against other religions is clear from these verses.

Quran: [5.51] O you who believe! do not take the Jews and the Christians for friends; they are friends of each other; and whoever amongst you takes them for a friend, then surely he is one of them; surely Allah does not

guide the unjust people.

[5.82] Certainly you will find the most violent of people in enmity for

those who believe (to be) the Jews and those who are polytheists, and you will certainly find the nearest in friendship to those who believe (to be) those who say: We are Christians; this is because there are priests and monks among them and because they do not behave proudly.

[9.30] And the Jews say: Uzair is the son of Allah; and the Christians say: The Messiah is the son of Allah; these are the words of their mouths; they imitate the saying of those who disbelieved before; may Allah destroy them; how they are turned away!

[4.160] Wherefore for the iniquity of those who are Jews did We disallow to them the good things which had been made lawful for them and for their hindering many (people) from Allah's way.

[5.18] And the Jews and the Christians say: We are the sons of Allah and His beloved ones. Say: Why does He then chastise you for your faults?

Sahih Bukhari Volume 4, Book 52, Number 283: Narrated Abu Juhaifa: I asked Ali, "Do you have the knowledge of any Divine Inspiration besides what is in Allah's Book?" 'Ali replied, "No, by Him Who splits the grain of corn and creates the soul. I don't think we have such knowledge, but we have the ability of understanding which Allah may endow a person with, so that he may understand the Qur'an, and we have what is written in this paper as well." I asked, "What is written in this paper?" He replied, "(The regulations of) blood-money, the freeing

of captives, and the judgment that no Muslim should be killed for killing an infidel."

******* 3. Islam is disgusting because it is bloodthirsty and genocidal.

Mohammed himself led at least 17 military expeditions. The majority of these were offensive in nature. Often they served little purpose but to

bring Mohammed and his followers slaves and booty. At one time Arabia was almost 40% Jewish. Mohammed annihilated the majority of them and subjected the rest to a humilitating second class citizen status. His followers murders tens of millions of Persians, Hindus, Turks, Armenian, Kurds, Europeans, etc. etc. etc. The following examples from the Islamic religious texts give the source of the Muslim attitudes.

Quran: [9:5] But when the forbidden months are past, then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them, an seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in

wait for them in every stratagem (of war); but if they repent, and establish regular prayers and practice regular charity, then open the way for them: for God is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.

[9.123] O you who believe! fight those of the unbelievers who are near to you and let them find in you hardness; and know that Allah is with those who guard (against evil).

[4.74] Therefore let those fight in the way of Allah, who sell this world's life for the hereafter; and whoever fights in the way of Allah,

then be he slain or be he victorious, We shall grant him a mighty reward.

[4:95] Not equal are those believers who sit (at home) and receive no hurt, and those who strive and fight in the cause of God with their goods and their persons. God hath granted a grade higher to those who strive and fight with their goods and persons than to those who sit (at

home). Unto all (in Faith) Hath God promised good: But those who strive

and fight Hath He distinguished above those who sit (at home) by a special reward,-

[8.12] When your Lord revealed to the angels: I am with you, therefore make firm those who believe. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them.

[8.57] Therefore if you overtake them in fighting, then scatter by (making an example of) them those who are in their rear, that they may be mindful.

[9.111] Surely Allah has bought of the believers their persons and their property for this, that they shall have the garden; they fight in

Allah's way, so they slay and are slain; a promise which is binding on Him in the Taurat and the Injeel and the Quran; and who is more faithful to his covenant than Allah? Rejoice therefore in the pledge which you have made; and that is the mighty achievement.

[47.4] So when you meet in battle those who disbelieve, then smite the necks until when you have overcome them, then make (them) prisoners, and afterwards either set them free as a favor or let them ransom (themselves) until the war terminates. That (shall be so); and if Allah

had pleased He would certainly have exacted what is due from them, but that He may try some of you by means of others; and (as for) those who are slain in the way of Allah, He will by no means allow their deeds to

[48.16] Say to those of the dwellers of the desert who were left behind: You shall soon be invited (to fight) against a people possessing mighty prowess; you will fight against them until they submit; then if you obey, Allah will grant you a good reward; and if you turn back as you turned back before, He will punish you with a painful punishment.

Sahih Bukhari Volume 5, Book 59, Number 448: Narrated 'Aisha: Sad was wounded on the day of Khandaq (i.e. Trench) when a man from Quraish, called Hibban bin Al-'Araqa hit him (with an arrow). The man was Hibban bin Qais from (the tribe of) Bani Mais bin 'Amir bin Lu'ai who shot an arrow at Sad's medial arm vein (or main artery of the arm).

The Prophet pitched a tent (for Sad) in the Mosque so that he might be near to the Prophet to visit. When the Prophet returned from the (battle) of Al-Khandaq (i.e.Trench) and laid down his arms and took a bath Gabriel came to him while he (i.e. Gabriel) was shaking the dust off his head, and said, "You have laid down the arms?" By Allah, I have

not laid them down. Go out to them (to attack them)." The Prophet said,

"Where?" Gabriel pointed towards Bani Quraiza. So Allah's Apostle went to them (i.e. Banu Quraiza) (i.e. besieged them). They then surrendered

to the Prophet's judgment but he directed them to Sad to give his verdict concerning them. Sad said, "I give my judgment that their warriors should be killed, their women and children should be taken as captives, and their properties distributed."

***** 4. Islam is disgusting because it supports slavery.

Reading the Quran one can see an extremely casual attitude to the idea of having slaves. Owning slaves is assumed to be a fact of life. There is never any injunction within either the Quran or the Hadith against doing so. Mohammed set the example by owning twenty eight slaves of his

own. Slavery continued within the Muslim world until the European colonialists forced them to stop. But even today, slavery is common in such Islamic states as Mauritania and Sudan. Muslims claim that the Islamic texts were designed to do away with slavery, but this is purely

a rationalization. After thirteen hundred years of practicing slavery, no Muslims ever showed any sign or desire to give it up.

For those of you who are unclear about Quranic terminology, "those whom

your right hand possesses" means slaves.

Quran: [16.71]: And Allah has made some of you excel others in the means of subsistence, so those who are made to excel do not give away their sustenance to those whom their right hands possess so that they should be equal therein; is it then the favor of Allah which they deny?

[39.29]: Allah sets forth an example: There is a slave in whom are (several) partners differing with one another, and there is another slave wholly owned by one man. Are the two alike in condition? (All) praise is due to Allah. Nay! most of them do not know.

[24.32]: And marry those among you who are single and those who are fit

among your male slaves and your female slaves; if they are needy, Allah

will make them free from want out of His grace; and Allah is Ample-giving, Knowing.

[16.75]: Allah sets forth a parable: (consider) a slave, the property of another, (who) has no power over anything, and one whom We have granted from Ourselves a goodly sustenance so he spends from it secretly and openly; are the two alike? (All) praise is due to Allah!

***** 5. Islam is disgusting because it is divisive.

The central function of the Quran is to split mankind into two distinct

categories - the believers and the unbelievers. Then playing upon this distinction it uses the psychological ploy of constantly threatening the unbeliever with hell and offering to reward the obedient believer with heaven. This same theme, with very little variation is repeated several hundred times within the Quran. In addition to this, the constantly destructive and hateful language that is directed at the unbeliever can only serve to ever increase the hatred of the Muslim for

the unbeliever. From the constant process of brain washing that we see in the Quran, it is easy to see why Muslims have always treated non Muslims as sub human and why Islam has always had bloody borders.

Here is a tiny fraction of the examples:

Quran: [22:19-22] But as for those who disbelieve, garments of fire will be cut out for them, boiling fluid will be poured down their heads. Whereby that which is in their bellies, and their skins too, will be melted; And for them are hooked rods of iron. Whenever, in their anguish, they would go forth from thence they are driven back therein and (it is said unto them): Taste the doom of burning.

[4.56] (As for) those who disbelieve in Our communications, We shall make them enter fire; so oft as their skins are thoroughly burned, We will change them for other skins, that they may taste the chastisement;

surely Allah is Mighty, Wise. [4.57] And (as for) those who believe and do good deeds, We will make them enter gardens beneath which rivers flow, to abide in them for ever; they shall have therein virgins, and We shall make them enter a dense shade.

[57.19] And (as for) those who believe in Allah and His apostles, these

it is that are the truthful and the faithful ones in the sight of their

Lord: they shall have their reward and their light, and (as for) those who disbelieve and reject Our communications, these are the inmates of the hell.

[48.6] And (that) He may punish the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women, and the polytheistic men and the polytheistic women, the entertainers of evil thoughts about Allah. On them is the evil turn, and Allah is wroth with them and has cursed them and prepared hell for them, and evil is the resort.

[7.179] And certainly We have created for hell many of the jinn and the

men; they have hearts with which they do not understand, and they have eyes with which they do not see, and they have ears with which they do not hear; they are as cattle, nay, they are in worse errors; these are the heedless ones.

[8.37] That Allah might separate the impure from the good, and put the impure, some of it upon the other, and pile it up together, then cast it into hell; these it is that are the losers.

[9.73] O Prophet! strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be unyielding to them; and their abode is hell, and evil

[98.6] Surely those who disbelieve from among the followers of the Book

and the polytheists shall be in the fire of hell, abiding therein; they

are the worst of men.

[3.12] Say to those who disbelieve: You shall be vanquished, and driven

together to hell; and evil is the resting-place.

[35.34] And (as for) those who disbelieve, for them is the fire of hell; it shall not be finished with them entirely so that they should die, nor shall the chastisement thereof be lightened to them: even thus

do We retribute every ungrateful one.

***** 6. Islam is disgusting because it approves of the rape of slave girls.

Incredible though it may seem, Islam is a religion which approves of the rape of innocent women who are captured in battle. Even if those women have living husbands. Note: "whom their right hands posses" means slaves.

Quran: [23.1-6] Successful indeed are the believers, Who are humble in their prayers, And who keep aloof from what is vain, And who are givers of poor-rate, And who guard their private parts, Except before their mates

or those whom their right hands possess, for they surely are not blameable.

Quran: [70:29] And those who guard their chastity, [70:30] Except with their wives and the (captives) whom their right hands possess,- for (then) they are not to be blamed,

Sahih Muslim Book 008, Number 3383: Jabir (Allah be pleased with him) reported that a man came to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: I have a slave-girl who is our servant and she carries water for us and I have intercourse with her, but I do not want her to conceive. He said: Practise 'azl, if you so like, but what is decreed for her will come to her. The person stayed back (for some time) and then came and said: The girl has become

pregnant, whereupon he said: I told you what was decreed for her would come to her.

Sahih Muslim Book 008, Number 3432: Abu Sa'id al-Khudri (Allah her pleased with him) reported that at the Battle of Hanain Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) sent an army

to Autas and encountered the enemy and fought with them. Having overcome them and taken them captives, the Companions of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) seemed to refrain from having intercourse with captive women because of their husbands being polytheists. Then Allah, Most High, sent down regarding that:" And women already married, except those whom your right hands possess (iv. 24)" (i. e. they were lawful for them when their 'Idda period came

***** 7. Islam is disgusting because it considers women to be stupid.

These Hadith are self explanitory when it comes to showing Mohammed's regard for the intelligence of women.

Sahih Bukhari Volume 3, Book 48, Number 826: Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri: The Prophet said, "Isn't the witness of a woman equal to half of that of a man?" The women said, "Yes." He said, "This is because of the deficiency of a woman's mind."

Sahih Bukhari Volume 2, Book 24, Number 541: Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri ." Then he went towards the women and said. "O women! Give alms, for I have seen that the majority of the dwellers of Hell-Fire were you (women)." The women asked, "O Allah's Apostle! What is the reason for it?" He replied, "O women! You curse frequently, and are ungrateful to your husbands. I have not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence and religion than you..

******** 8. Islam is disgusting because it denies women equal rights and approves of beating them.

You will never see Muslims tap dance and rationalize any more than they

do to justify the following verse. But the bottom line is that the inferiority of women is clearly defined in this verse.

Quran: [4:34] Men are the managers of the affairs of women for that God has preferred in bounty one of them over another, and for that they have expended of their property. Righteous women are therefore obedient, guarding the secret for God's guarding. And those you fear may be rebellious admonish; banish them to their couches, and beat them. If they then obey you, look not for any way against them; God is All-high,

Men may marry four women. Women may marry one man.

Quran: [4:3] If ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly with the orphans, Marry women of your choice, Two or three or four; but if ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one, or (a captive) that your right hands possess, that will be more suitable, to prevent you from doing injustice.

[4:15] If any of your women are guilty of lewdness, Take the evidence of four (Reliable) witnesses from amongst you against them; and if they

testify, confine them to houses until death do claim them, or God ordain for them some (other) way.

Men inherit twice as much as women.

Quran: [4:11] God (thus) directs you as regards your Children's (Inheritance):

to the male, a portion equal to that of two females: if only daughters,

two or more, their share is two-thirds of the inheritance; if only one,

her share is a half. For parents, a sixth share of the inheritance to each, if the deceased left children; if no children, and the parents are the (only) heirs, the mother has a third; if the deceased Left brothers (or sisters) the mother has a sixth. (The distribution in all cases ('s) after the payment of legacies and debts. Ye know not whether

your parents or your children are nearest to you in benefit. These are settled portions ordained by God; and God is All-knowing, Al- wise.

Women don't have the soundness of mind to be witnesses, so it takes two

women witnesses to equal one man.

Quran: [2.282] O you who believe! when you deal with each other in contracting

a debt for a fixed time, then write it down; and let a scribe write it down between you with fairness; and the scribe should not refuse to write as Allah has taught him, so he should write; and let him who owes

the debt dictate, and he should be careful of (his duty to) Allah, his Lord, and not diminish anything from it; but if he who owes the debt is

unsound in understanding, or weak, or (if) he is not able to dictate himself, let his guardian dictate with fairness; and call in to witness

from among your men two witnesses; but if there are not two men, then one man and two women from among those whom you choose to be witnesses,

so that if one of the two errs, the second of the two may remind the other; and the witnesses should not refuse when they are summoned; and be not averse to writing it (whether it is) small or large, with the time of its falling due; .

A man is allowed to beat his wife for any reason he likes.

Abu Dawud Book 11, Number 2142: Narrated Umar ibn al-Khattab: The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: A man will not be asked as to why

***** 9. Islam is disgusting because it considers women as being dirty and irredeemably corrupt.

Women are polluted during menstruation.

Quran: [2:222] They ask thee concerning women's courses. Say: They are a hurt and a pollution: So keep away from women in their courses, and do not approach them until they are clean. But when they have purified themselves, ye may approach them in any manner , time, or place ordained for you by God. For God loves those who turn to Him constantly

and He loves those who keep themselves pure and clean.

Sahih Bukhari Volume 7, Book 62, Number 30: Narrated Abdullah bin 'Umar: Allah's Apostle said, "Evil omen is in the women, the house and the horse.'

Sahih Muslim Book 008, Number 3467: Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported: Woman has been created from a rib and will in no way be straightened for you; so if you wish to benefit by her, benefit by her while crookedness remains in

her. And if you attempt to straighten her, you will break her, and breaking her is divorcing her.

Sahih Bukhari Volume 7, Book 62, Number 33: Narrated Usama bin Zaid: The Prophet said, "After me I have not left any affliction more harmful

Sahih Bukhari Volume 7, Book 62, Number 126: Narrated Imran: The Prophet said, "I looked at Paradise and saw that the majority of its residents were the poor; and I looked at the (Hell) Fire and saw that the majority of its residents were women."

***** 10. Islam is disgusting because it equates women to animals.

Sahih Bukhari Volume 1, Book 9, Number 490: Narrated 'Aisha: The things which annul the prayers were mentioned before me. They said,

"Prayer is annulled by a dog, a donkey and a woman (if they pass in front of the praying people)." I said, "You have made us (i.e. women) dogs. I saw the Prophet praying while I used to lie in my bed between him and the Qibla Whenever I was in need of something, I would slip away. for I disliked to face him."

Abu Dawud Book 11, Number 2155: Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As: The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: If one of you marries a woman or buys a slave, he should say: "O Allah, I ask Thee for the good in her, and in the disposition Thou hast given her; I take refuge in Thee from the evil in her, and in the disposition Thou hast given her." When he buys a camel, he should take hold of the top of its hump and say the same kind of thing.

***** 11. Islam is disgusting because it approves of old men having sex

Because Mohammed married a 6 year old girl, and had sex with her when she was 9, the Muslim world has had a standard of child marriage ever since. This has brought about untold mental and occasionally physical suffering upon these poor girls for 1400 years. Even today, one occasionally sees a twenty year old grandmother in Islamic societies. Mohammed was 53 at the time that he had sex with the 9 year old Aisha.

Here are the Hadith which document Mohammed's transgressions.

Sahih Bukhari Volume 7, Book 62, Number 17: Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah: When I got married, Allah's Apostle said to me, "What type of lady have

you married?" I replied, "I have married a matron' He said, "Why, don't

you have a liking for the virgins and for fondling them?" Jabir also said: Allah's Apostle said, "Why didn't you marry a young girl so that you might play with her and she with you?'

Sahih Muslim Book 008, Number 3309: 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported: Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) married me when I was six years old, and I was admitted to his house at the age of nine. She further said: We went to Medina and I had an attack of fever for a month, and my hair had come down to the earlobes. Umm Ruman (my mother) came to me and I was at that time on a swing along with my playmates. She called me loudly and I went to her and I did not know what she had wanted of me. She took hold of my hand and took me to the door, and I was saying: Ha, ha (as if I was gasping), until the agitation of my heart was over. She took me to a house, where had gathered the women of the Ansar. They all blessed me and wished me good luck and said: May you have share in good. She (my mother) entrusted me to them. They washed my head and embellished me and nothing frightened me. Allah's Messenger (, may peace be upon him) came there in the morning, and I was entrusted to him.

Sahih Muslim Book 008, Number 3310: 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported: Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) married me when I was six years old, and I was admitted to his house when I was nine years old.

Sahih Muslim Book 008, Number 3311: 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported that Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) married her when she was seven years old, and he was

taken to his house as a bride when she was nine, and her dolls were with her; and when he (the Holy Prophet) died she was eighteen years old.

Sahih Bukhari Volume 5, Book 58, Number 234: Narrated Aisha: The Prophet engaged me when I was a girl of six (years). We went to Medina and stayed at the home of Bani-al-Harith bin Khazraj. Then I got

ill and my hair fell down. Later on my hair grew (again) and my mother,

Um Ruman, came to me while I was playing in a swing with some of my girl friends. She called me, and I went to her, not knowing what she wanted to do to me. She caught me by the hand and made me stand at the door of the house. I was breathless then, and when my breathing became Allright, she took some water and rubbed my face and head with it. Then

she took me into the house. There in the house I saw some Ansari women who said, "Best wishes and Allah's Blessing and a good luck." Then she entrusted me to them and they prepared me (for the marriage). Unexpectedly Allah's Apostle came to me in the forenoon and my mother handed me over to him, and at that time I was a girl of nine years of age.

Sahih Bukhari Volume 8, Book 73, Number 151: Narrated 'Aisha: I used to play with the dolls in the presence of the Prophet, and my girl friends also used to play with me. When Allah's Apostle used to enter (my dwelling place) they used to hide themselves, but the Prophet

would call them to join and play with me. (The playing with the dolls and similar images is forbidden, but it was allowed for 'Aisha at that time, as she was a little girl, not yet reached the age of puberty.) (Fateh-al-Bari page 143, Vol.13)

Sahih Bukhari Volume 7, Book 62, Number 64: Narrated 'Aisha: that the Prophet married her when she was six years old and he consummated his marriage when she was nine years old, and then she remained with him for nine years (i.e., till his death).

Sahih Bukhari Volume 7, Book 62, Number 88: Narrated 'Ursa: The Prophet wrote the (marriage contract) with 'Aisha while she was six

years old and consummated his marriage with her while she was nine years old and she remained with him for nine years (i.e. till his death).

Apparently Mohammed waited until the day after Aisha's first menstruation, and then had sex with her immediately in the morning of the day when she was brought to him.

Sahih Bukhari Volume 7, Book 62, Number 90: Narrated Aisha: When the Prophet married me, my mother came to me and made me enter the

house (of the Prophet) and nothing surprised me but the coming of Allah's Apostle to me in the forenoon.

***** 12. Islam is disgusting because it is full of superstition and dogma.

I have not gone into many of the primitive Islamic superstitions in this section, such as the invisible creatures called the jinn. But here

are a few other examples.

Vol 4, #540 - Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar: Allah's Apostle ordered that the dogs should be killed.

>From the Hadith of Abu Dawud -

#2839 - Abd Allah B. Mughaffal reported the apostle of Allah as saying:

Were dogs not a species of creature I should command that they all be killed; but kill every pure black one.

#3813 - Abu Zubair heard Jabir Abdullah saying: Allah's messenger ordered us to kill dogs and we carried out this order so much so that we also killed the dog roaming with a women from the desert. Then Allah's apostle forbade their killing. He said: "It is your duty to kill the jet-black (dog) having two spots (on the eyes) for it is a devil.

Sahih Bukhari Vol 7, #843 Narrated Salim's father: "Once Gabriel promised to visit the Prophet but he delayed and the Prophet got worried about that. At last he came out and found Gabriel and complained to him of his grief (for his delay). Gabriel said to him, "We do not enter a place in which there is

a picture or a dog.""

Sahih Bukhari Volume 1, Book 4, Number 234: Narrated Abu Qilaba: Anas said, "Some people of 'Ukl or 'Uraina tribe came to Medina and its

climate did not suit them. So the Prophet ordered them to go to the herd of (Milch) camels and to drink their milk and urine (as a medicine). So they went as directed and after they became healthy, they

killed the shepherd of the Prophet and drove away all the camels. The news reached the Prophet early in the morning and he sent (men) in their pursuit and they were captured and brought at noon. He then ordered to cut their hands and feet (and it was done), and their eyes were branded with heated pieces of iron, They were put in 'Al-Harra' and when they asked for water, no water was given to them." Abu Qilaba said, "Those people committed theft and murder became infidels after embracing Islam and fought against Allah and His Apostle ."

**** 13. Islam is disgusting because it murders apostates.

If a person is born into Islam or accepts Islam he is never allowed to change his mind, not matter how genuine his reasons may be. The penalty

for leaving Islam for anyone living in a country that is under Islamic law is death. This standard is implied in the Quran, it is spelled out in the Hadith, and it is codefied in the Islamic Sharia law.

[3.85] And whoever desires a religion other than Islam, it shall not be

accepted from him, and in the hereafter he shall be one of the losers. [3.86] How shall Allah guide a people who disbelieved after their believing and (after) they had borne witness that the Apostle was true and clear arguments had come to them; and Allah does not guide the unjust people. [3.87] (As for) these, their reward is that upon them is the curse of Allah and the angels and of men, all together.

[9.73] O Prophet! strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be unyielding to them; and their abode is hell, and evil

is the destination. [9.74] They swear by Allah that they did not speak,

and certainly they did speak, the word of unbelief, and disbelieved after their Islam, and they had determined upon what they have not been

able to effect, and they did not find fault except because Allah and His Apostle enriched them out of His grace; therefore if they repent, it will be good for them; and if they turn back, Allah will chastise them with a painful chastisement in this world and the hereafter, and they shall not have in the land any guardian or a helper.

Bukhari, Volume 9, #17 "Narrated Abdullah: Allah's Messenger said, "The blood of a Muslim who confesses that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that I am His Messenger, cannot be shed except in three cases: in Qisas (equality in punishment)

for murder, a married person who commits illegal sexual intercourse and

the one who reverts from Islam (Apostate) and leaves the Muslims."

Bukhari Volume 9, #57 Narrated Ikrima, "Some atheists were brought to Ali and he burnt them. The news of this event, reached Ibn Abbas who said, "If I had been in his place, I would

not have burnt them, as Allah's messenger forbade it, saying, "Do not punish anybody with Allah's punishment (fire)." I would have killed them according to the statement of Allah's Messenger, "Whoever changed his Islamic religion, then kill him."

Bukhari Volume 9, #58 Narrated Abu Bruda, "Abu Musa said.....Behold there was a fettered man beside Abu Musa. Muadh asked, "Who is this (man)?" Abu Musa said, "He was a Jew and became a Muslim and hen reverted back to Judaism." Then Abu Musa requested Muadh to sit down but Muadh said, "I will not sit down till he has been killed. This is the judgment of Allah and his messenger," and repeated it thrice. Then Abu Musa ordered that the man be killed, and he was killed. Abu Musa added, "Then we discussed the night prayers

Bukhari Volume 9, Book 84, Number 64: Narrated 'Ali: Whenever I tell you a narration from Allah's Apostle, by Allah, I would

rather fall down from the sky than ascribe a false statement to him, but if I tell you something between me and you (not a Hadith) then it was indeed a trick (i.e., I may say things just to cheat my enemy). No doubt I heard Allah's Apostle saying, "During the last days there will appear some young foolish people who will say the best words but their faith will not go beyond their throats (i.e. they will have no faith) and will go out from (leave) their religion as an arrow goes out of the

game. So, where-ever you find them, kill them, for who-ever kills them shall have reward on the Day of Resurrection."

This is by no means an exhaustive list of the reasons why Islam is a disgusting religion, but it will do for a start.

These reasons only cover the material of their own theological texts. The other side of why Islam is disgusting is related to their actions as seen throughout history. And by reading the history of Islamic civilization it quickly becomes apparent that Muslims do not hesitate to act upon the teachings that I have quoted.

All religions are disgusting. But most disgusting are those who try to take away the freedom to worship as one chooses.

During the Vietnam War, American soldiers (presumably Christian) commonly wrote "Kill a Gook For Christ" on their helmets.

Do a bit of research:

For once, you are right, Jim. All religions, can be disgusting, when those who are in it start to forget that there are many others out there who are very different and hold very different views, and that these people need to be respected just as they are!
