LESSON FOUR: LIBRARIES, COLLEGES, AND MATHEMATICS

This lesson describes medieval Muslims’ zeal for knowledge and learning. Enabled by the art of papermaking which the Muslims learned from the Chinese, this zeal gave rise to a proliferation of books, libraries, and institutions of higher learning. The Abbasids founded the House of Wisdom in ninth century Baghdad, where scholars translated the works of the Greeks, Persians, Indians, and others in various fields of science and mathematics. Muslim colleges were places of learning open to people in all walks of life and demonstrated many characteristics of modern universities. Of all the fields that Muslims excelled in, mathematics is perhaps the area where they contributed the most. Geometry is a related field where the Muslims combined science with art, yielding magnificent results in geometrical designs that embellish tiles, artwork, and mosques across the Muslim world.

LESSON SIX: SCIENCE AND HUMANITIES

This lesson examines the contributions of Muslims in diverse fields, including astronomy, geography, philosophy, and literature. Muslim astronomers translated the works of the Greeks, Indians, and others into Arabic and built upon their discoveries and research. They studied Ptolemy’s tables and made their own observations using the astrolabe, which they enhanced and used for multiple purposes. Muslim scientists such as Ibn al-Haytham studied optics and made great advances in that field. Muslims were also interested in timekeeping, and inventors such as al-Jazari designed various types of clocks. In geography and history, Ibn Battuta is considered one of the greatest travelers of all times. In philosophy and poetry, Averroes and Rumi are still world renowned. The tolerance and learning that characterized much of Muslim history allowed these advances and contributions. Today, American Muslims continue to contribute to this country and the world in multiple fields and professions.
