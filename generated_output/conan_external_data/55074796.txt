Connecting Questions > Roles of Women > Lesson Plans

Learning objectives Students will learn that monolithic cultures and accurate stereotypes of Muslim women do not exist. A combination of factors affects the role of Muslim women as a group and individually over time. Grade level 9-12 Assessment Resources NCSS standards

Time estimate Approximately 90 minutes What you'll need (see Resources for links)

Computer(s) with Internet access and/or library resources

No country, culture, or group stays the same indefinitely. Consider that it wasn't until 1920 that women in the United States were allowed to vote. National origin, family background, economic levels, and historical context all help determine opportunities people have in life. Muslim women are subject to these factors as well. In this lesson, students will learn how and why the role of women in Islamic cultures has evolved.

Examine and discuss the factors that can affect any woman's life and accomplishments:

The context of her culture at the time (e.g., legal interpretations, educational opportunities, and behavioral expectations)

The dictates of her religion and her family background (including level of education, wealth, and status)

Her individual talents and personal sense of ambition

Offer the example of Walladah bint Mustakfi as a case study of how a number of factors influence a woman's choices.

Walladah bint Mustakfi (c. 1001-1080 C.E.) Walladah was the daughter of the caliph of Cordoba in Islamic Spain. Cordoba was a tolerant, multicultural society, famous for its many libraries and sophisticated literary life, in which women were often scholars. After her father's death, Walladah inherited enough wealth to guarantee her independence. She was well known as a poet and hosted literary gatherings for both men and women. She had several famous love affairs, including one with the prominent poet Ibn Zaydun, but never married. Her surviving poetry reflects her free spirit. She was known to have designed robes that had embroidered sleeves. On one robe was embroidered, "I am fit for high positions, by God, and go on my way with pride." On another was embroidered, "I allow my lover to touch my cheek, and bestow my kiss on him who craves it."

Use this example to help students understand that Walladah bint Mustakfi lived in a tolerant time that permitted significant personal freedoms. In addition, the wealth and position of her family provided economic independence and access to other opportunities.

Working alone or in small groups, students will then choose a famous Muslim woman. Some suggestions are included here.

Khadija, wife of Muhammad

present-day Saudi Arabia

Aisha bint Abu Bakr, wife of Muhammad

present-day Saudi Arabia

Fatima, daughter of Muhammad

present-day Saudi Arabia

Rabia al-Adawiyya, the first Sufi

Walladah bint Mustakfi

Roxelana, Hurrem Sultan

Students will use the Internet and print resources

to research the woman chosen and record as much of the following information as possible:

Birth and death dates

Country of origin/where she lived

How did she reflect the culture of her time?

How did she rise above it?

Family background/social status/wealth

If time permits, students may present their research to the class. Through chronologically organized presentations, students will learn how the roles of Muslim women have evolved.

Lead a discussion focusing on the common denominators in the lives of exceptional women in Islamic and Middle Eastern history. Some discussion questions may include the following:

How and why did the roles of Muslim women evolve?

What factors allowed these women to go beyond the norm?

What common obstacles did they face?

How are their stories similar to those of famous women in other cultures?

Does the role of women and the rights afforded them always improve? Are there examples in the Middle East and in other regions in the world where women have lost freedoms?

How well can the student give examples of factors that influence the role of a woman in her culture?

Has the student completed the chart completely and accurately?
