CMV: Islam is as much as, if not more of a cult that Mormonism

A lot of people refer to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints as a cult. And I admit it has cult-like elements. Sure it is not like Waren Jeff`s FLDS (a true cult) but it has certain cult clements.

At the same time, Islam has more of these cult elements; but no one calls it a cult. Keep in mind I am referring to mainstream Islam, not Taliban, etc.

Here are some characteristics of a cult

Reverance to a leader

Well both faiths revere God. But the leader here is their founding prophet. Mormons reverse Joseph Smith, but Muslims almost worship Muhammed by attesting to his prophethood in prayers, adding a title to his name, etc.

While Muslims do not have a living prophet, Mormons do so in this area I would say Mormons are more culty. On the other hand, they are not more uniquely culty than Catholics and their Pope

Both religions are strict, but Islam is stricter.

Diet: Both prohibit alcohol. Mormons prohibit tea and coffe which is strict. But then Muslims prohibit pork, and require meat to be blessed and slaughtered in a certain way which is strict and also seems to lack basis (ie cult)

Sex: I mean, both follow conservative ethics. No different from any other religion - no sex outside marriage, no LGBTQ, etc.. However, with mosques and many muslim gatherins being gender segreated, in a way no other faith is, I`d argue Islam is more culty. Also Islam still allows polygamy while Mormonism abolished it 100 years ago.

Dress: Mormons dress conservatively yes. But I mean nothing is as bad as the hijab.

Conformity: I mean Muslim women many are all dressed covered up, with a black robe. Can`t tell one from the other.

Moral Depravity of the founder:

Muhammed married a 6-year old and raped a 9 year old at 56. Smith married a 15 year old at 38. Both are wrong but one is a lot worse, incomprably so.

Muhammed broke his own rules by having 9 wives. Smith did not break his own rules, sure he had like 30 wives but everyone was allowed that. Specifial privilges for leader --> cult

Both have plenty of that. Mormons about thier past actions re: Black Men and the priesthood. Muslims about Muhammed`s actions

Difficulty of exiting

Both faiths it is extremely hard to leave. r/exmuslim and r/ExMormon both attest to this. You get shunned, disowned, gaslit, fear coming out, parents break down if you leave, etc.

But in Islam, it is a lot harder simply because in Muslim majority countries apostates are killed ( Apostasy laws world map - Apostasy in Islam - Wikipedia ) and many Muslims today maintain this belief ( Muslim beliefs on death penalty for leaving Islam (Pew Research Center 2013) - Apostasy in Islam - Wikipedia ). Not taliban or ISIS, just mainstream muslim nations

While both religions are strict and hard to leave, I see Islam as more of a cult because of the death penalty on Muslims leaving and the very strict laws in Islam when it comes to gender, etc.

There is no central authority of Islam. There are rules, of course, and certain things you're supposed to do to be considered a Muslim, but there isn't anyone who can, like, kick you out of the religion. Of course, you could do something to offend your local leaders in the community, but you can't really be thrown out.

By contrast, you ABSOLUTELY can be kicked out of Mormonism, it's very very centralized, and anything you say or do can be used as evidence to excommunicate you, which is a very official way of making you a pariah in the church. There are very official rules and standards for what is ok and not ok.

To me, that's the biggest difference and the biggest thing that differentiates a cult from a religion in my opinion. I wouldn't necessarily say Mormonism is a cult, but it is definitely more cult-like in that respect.

There are some exceptions, like how Saudi Arabia has total control over the Hajj, but I don't think anyone in Saudi Arabia could stop you from opening a mosque, meanwhile the Mormon church can and will go after you if you tried to open an unofficial LDS church.

Fair point. The concept of highly central control, etc. does play a key roles in what causes a cult. Islam does not have a central authority and like you said anyone can start a mosque and teach Islam their way. Δ

There is no central authority of Islam.

Shiah absolutely do have a central authority.

Both of your statements can be true at once.

The central authority of Shia Islam (~10% of Muslims) is not the central authority of all Islam.

In much the same way that the Pope is the head of the Catholic church, and the Queen is the head of the Anglican church, and neither of them are the central authority of all Christianity.

In that case you are comparing all Islam with one particular Christian sect, and in fact, one particular Mormon sect. You aren't comparing like with like.

By that reasoning Mormons don't have a central authority because not all mormons recognize the LDS leadership.

Not only do you have many radical conservative sects in Utah and Arizona and other Western states, you have the less conservative sect that Joseph Smith's wife founded which is still going strong in the Great Lakes region.

Yes, that's the whole point of the CMV - comparing Islam to a particular sect of Christianity called Mormonism.

As I said something not considered a cult can still be problematic.

Islam is too large and varied to be a cult. Cults are almost associated with a discrete group of people.

So if Scitentologist had 250,000 members say instead, what it stop being a cult? The JW have 8.7M members yet many sitll call them a cult

I don’t think it’s about raw numbers so much as the group continuing to be a discrete one, with a consistent culture and adherence to rules/norms. There are millions of LDS but they are quite consistent in their structure, culture, and adherence. Muslims are not a discrete group in this way, they have extremely varied culture, leadership structures, and adherence. Many disagree so vehemently they are literally at war with each other!

what ^^ said. But it would be fair to say sects and groups are more cult like than others, and very cult like some.

Islam as a whole is less cult like than Mormonism, but individual groups are more cult like within Islam.

Islam has about 2 billion members.

Mormons, especially in Utah, would appear to be a considerably more close-knit group which makes the "cult-like" label stick a bit better

Good point. Though aren't many Muslims, especaily in European enclaves, quite close knit as well?

Choosing to exist amongst familiar communities in a foreign country is a different motive than practicing and advocating for exclusivity and exclusion of foreign beliefs.

Pakistan recently sentenced one of its citizens to death for blasphemy because he said was a christian eho didnt believe mohommed was a prophet.

I highly doubt it would be to the same extent. Especially considering many European Muslims come from many different countries/backgrounds whereas in Utah the LDS are a cultural monolith

They are based on nationalities as well.

Muslims from Bosnia and Indonesia will have nothing in common and won't live together.

A Muslim from Pakistan is more likely to shop in a Sikh-owned store or hang out in a Hindu neighborhood than hang out with Sudanese communities.

I am referring to mainstream Islam

This is the largest religion in the world, I don't think relying on small groups of it proves a point.

Second largest. Christianity has about 200 million more adherents (split across its sects).

Gotcha, I thought I read it was the largest but may have been confused, ty.

I think that all religions have cult-like sects. And all of them have decent people too. And nearly everyone within any religion has different degrees to which they follow the religion. They also have different beliefs about their own religions practice.

Thus, I don’t think that religions, as a whole, can be compared to one another, as a whole, on their level of cultish-ness. You need to break it down by sects within the religion.

It doesn't have to be a cult to have issues. I just think some are afraid to bring up issues with Islam for fear of being called prejudice/racist.

Well I`m comparing the mainstreamd LDS church with mainstream Islam (so I guess Sunni Islam)

People can be of any denomination and exhibit cult-like behavior. If you are unfamiliar with Islam, you might think all Muslim are like the Taliban. That is like a Chinese person thinking all Christians are Mormon. The problem with the view here is that people of ANY religion can fall victim to sub-pockets of cults and extremist behavior.

All religions also offer a type of gnosticism, even in Islam they have Sufi. In Judaism there is the Kabalah. The same way any religion can lead to salvation, any religion can lead to ruin.

I have lived amongst Muslims, read the Quran and even attended Mosque to offer Salat and learn to pray. You may be surprised to learn that there are different degrees of Islamic worship.

Not all Muslim even pray 5 times a day... while others are so strict that they will not consume a soda because they say it is Haram from a small amount of alcohol. I have met "muslims" that broke almost every stereotype of Islam you could imagine. There isn't a one-size-fits-all perspective you can take against an entire, massive religion.

Most of what a lot of people know about Islam, does not come from first hand experience. If you read the Quran, it is no more or less whacky than the Old and New Testament.

Despite what the media might have you thinking, the vast majority of Muslims I have met have been incredible people who would rather help you, than hurt you, no matter your religion. No Muslim I met ever tried to proselytize to me, or pray for my soul or do any other weird thing like some Christians - they were open to teaching and there were no stings attached and they might offer Shaddah (sp?), but I was never asked to it or felt pressured.

I actually felt welcome in every religious community I visited and participated with (which was all the ones I could). I even had s group of friends for a while, all different religions, very orthodox and strict, learned men, and we all got along great and were able to keep an open mind and have hilarious religious debates, which I miss dearly.

The Muslims I knew, within their own community, were always focused on people staying on their "Dean" (sp?) And that means. No toxins. Stay healthy. Do your fasts. Do your prayers. Call your grandmother. Don't gamble. Don't drink. Don't cause a scene. Don't get in trouble. Don't be violent. Muslims are humans too, and I knew many who were constantly "off their dean" and older Muslims (Ack (sp?)) Would be harassing them to get their life together and handle their business and be men.

Different strokes for different folks, but I think most people are all the same and the religious extremists and idiots only make up a small % of any major religion, but they give the whole thing a bad name. In my opinion, religion isn't a problem, not even organized religion, but it brings corruption and power just like any other institution, which is why I always admired gnostic style and Sufi style teachings (along with many other religions and sub-segments of major religions and philosophies that advocate for "self" knowledge).

Not all Muslims are like Muslims from Afghanistan. Plenty of Muslims in New York. New Jersey. Philly. Bangladesh.... you name it. They don't all adhere the same way, the religion isn't inherently "bad", nor are the followers, that is just more of a vocal minority giving the rest a bad name, IMO.

Please define 'cult', because strict rules and such don't seem to me to be particularly limited to what we would consider a cult or cultish behavior.

I believe I ran through cult chracteristics above. It is a gradient

I believe I asked you do define cult. These "characteristics" mean nothing without first establishing what a cult is. For example, you say reverence for a "leader" is cult-like behavior. Christianity worships their "leader" as a literal God. Does that mean Christianity gets a tick in the cult column?

My 2 cents. A cult would be a belief system based on blind belief AND extreme conformity to specific beliefs, language and customs. The more narrow and the more rigid the belief structure is the more cult like.

Christianity and all religions are cult like but the comparison here is to compare with is more of a cult. Both are systems of belief but the important question is how rigid and how much conformality is there. Mormon is more cult like than Islam. I would agree.

Christianity is a cult. Progressivism is a cult.

While science isn't a cult in it self, groups of scientist can form cults.

Seems like you need a more powerful word than "cult."

Cult is defined as "a social group that is defined by its unusual religious, spiritual, or philosophical beliefs and rituals, or its common interest in a particular personality, object, or goal"

or sometimes "a religion regarded as unorthodox."

By every definition of the word cult, almost every single religion is a cult. You seem to be aginst extremisim in general, not cults.

Well both faiths revere God. But the leader here is their founding prophet. Mormons reverse Joseph Smith, but Muslims almost worship Muhammed by attesting to his prophethood in prayers, adding a title to his name, etc.

Jesus Christ. Christianity is founded by Jesus Christ and they do worship him as part of God (or other divine thing ymmv by branch)

Both religions are strict, but Islam is stricter.

Diet: Both prohibit alcohol. Mormons prohibit tea and coffe which is strict. But then Muslims prohibit pork, and require meat to be blessed and slaughtered in a certain way which is strict and also seems to lack basis (ie cult)

ymmv. Judaism also bans pork, and requires meat to be bless a slaughtered a certain way. Also I am sure there is a basis for it that you just don't immediately no. I mean "ban pork means cult" seems to "lack basis"

For all of the rest of your post except "Moral deprativity of the founder", is again, your milage may vary. Islam is a religion of 1 billion+ people, with many different rules and actions etc.

Re: "Moral deprativity of the founder", it isn't relevant anymore, because we are talking about long dead people. You can't lead a cult if you are dead dead dead.

Once you control an entire region, be it Utah or the Abbasid Caliphate, you're not a cult. By definition, cults are a separate society within a nation, not the entire nation. If you just use "cult" to mean "a religion I disagree with," then you've ruined the whole usefulness of the term.

That's why I didn't say that Utah was an entire nation. But the Mormons did control the Utah Territory government, and if you want me to get ridiculously over-precise, then I suppose I could say that Mormonism stopped being a cult between 1890 and 1896, when the US government admitted Utah as a state, after extensive negotiations with the US government that caused the Mormons to moderate their most unpopular beliefs.

If I follow the definition of "cult" that your 3 links use, then up until the 1600s, literally every single religion on earth was a cult. What's the point of the word "cult", then? There has to be something in the definition that captures whether or not non-members consider members to be acceptable members of the nation. Americans accept Mormons and Muslims as members of polite society. Voters elect Mormons and Muslims to Congress, and Congress allows them to serve without controversy. Guyanans did not accept the Jonestown People's Temple as members of polite society.

I'm not sure I agree with that definition. Does that mean if Scientology takes over 70% of texas they change from a cult to an official religion?

Yes. A cult is socially unaccepted. If a bad thing becomes socially accepted, it's still bad, but it can't be called a cult any longer.

Damn it sure is wild how Muslims almost literally worship the prophet Mohammed as you say. Surely there’s not other religion where it’s chief prophet is held in such high regard! Certainly not Christianity, which is named after and exalts the prophet Jesus Christ to the point that he is considered the son of god an the object of worship! There are also no monastic or conservative Catholics anywhere in the world who dress very conservatively, have religious dietary customs, or who even act badly while hiding behind the social status the religion provides. /s

To describe Islam as a cult is just so wrong. It has zero hallmarks of what constitutes a cult. It’s not small, it’s not some new movement disconnected from prior religious contexts, it doesn’t have a leader, and it is riven by a deep schism between Sunni and Shia. Can you point to any “real” cult where it’s members were subdivided into two camps with fundamentally different dogma who wanted to kill each other? I don’t even think Mormonism makes any sense as a cult in the present day.

Killing, or at the very least shaming, disowning, not accepting apostates is culty.

Right bc in no other religious context have people been shamed, disowned or killed for straying from the faith. Have you heard of the cathar crusade? The reformation? Witch trials? Have you heard of how gay kids are treated in conservative Christian families? You are taking some creative liberties with what constitutes a cult.

Fundamentally the problem with the word 'cult' is that it tends to mean 'religion I dislike', or even 'small religion I dislike'. Muslims aren't small by any imagination.

Yeah about the clothes, do I have to remind you of the Mormon magic underwear? A Islamic woman can wear whatever she wants under her out clothes and in many cases they do. But with Mormons they were uncomfortable long underwear even in 110 degrees environment and have to wear long pants because of it or long skirts to the ground for women.

Also have we talked about old white guys interrogating teenage girls and boys about their masturbation and ask these boys and girls to describe it in detail. This is one of the main reasons that makes Mormon leaders to be cult leaders and shows they don't have souls. This is some kind of sexual abuse as we both know and it seems you totally forgot to talk about it.

I would say maybe Christian’s are a cult based off of their following of Jesus Christ, who is not god, but maybe a magician ??

Lol love the deflection. I’m all for criticizing the Christian faith for their wrong doings. Why can’t that same criticism be applied to Islam?

OP applied it to Islam already, the top level commenter is responding.

but Muslims almost worship Muhammed by attesting to his prophethood in prayers, adding a title to his name, etc.

almost worship [Jesus Christ] by attesting to his [divinity/godhood] in prayers, adding a title to his name, etc.

All religion is a cult.

Islam seems too decentralized to me to be a cult. Different sects, different ways of practicing, different levels of commitment, etc.

An important feature of a cult is hiding information - in the sense that all information about their beliefs and practices are not available to an outsider. It is only once you become a member and gradually rise up, you gain access to this.

Islamic beliefs and practices are not hidden, they are openly available and preached to everyone.

Not really, there are a lot of cults that don't hide their beliefs at all.

Firstly, I would like to point out that not all Muslims do that. Very few, by which I mean, like 1000 people not including taliban practice that extreme form of islam in this world. Also hijab is not a long black robe or some shit like that, it's just covering the hair and dressing decently, which men have to do as well (except covering hair part) The pedophilia part by the way, which history did you use here? Excepting that, people who leave Islam aren't killed. My uncle did. We still talk with him ever so often.

I think Quranists are more liberal. They don’t even believe in a ritual prayer.

For you to talk about Islam, you need to read the Quran, and it's telling that you have provided 0 quotes from the Quran.
