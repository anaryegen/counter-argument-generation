The subreddit is for both citizens and visitors of Tunisia or redditors who are just curious to know more about the country, to discuss a variety of topics, to share and contribute to events and other various subjects.

Examining global conditions reveals that regions embracing Islam often experience significant poverty, intense tribal conflicts, unimaginable atrocities, human rights violations, blatant bigotry, and gender inequality. When discussing these matters, individuals may be labeled as promoting "Islamophobia" or, more broadly, "Racism," when criticizing Islam. Criticism is often met with accusations of being a white supremacist, a new age colonizer, or a racist, despite the irony that Islam is an ideology, not a race, albeit a controversial one. Sure, all religions share face similar issues, like not aligning with a contemporary, scientific, fact-based understanding of reality, appearing outdated, and conflicting with modern values, as well as being blatantly false. But none other has the same morbid characteristics as Islam does. Christianity used to be similar, but Christians tamed their own delusions to make them compatible with the modern world. Muslims have failed to follow suit. The reality is that Islam has hindered development in Muslim countries. While the Middle East may have been a scientific hub centuries ago, it's not a big deal in the present. Also as a side note, most of the prominent Islamic golden age scholars, such as Ibn Rushd (Averroes) and Ibn Sina (Avicenna) belonged to the sect of Mutazilla, whose interpretations on Quran are being staunchly rejected by today's Islamic communities. Islamic "Golden age" was the result of liberal interpretation of Islam powered by the sect of Mutazilla, before mentally deficient individuals such as Al Hanbali and Al Ghazali paved way for Wahhabism. Muslims have doomed themselves by reversing their own developement as society by following a shitty, iron age book with absurd stories and disgusting morals. They have doomed the future of their children by brainwashing them into believing the same stories they were brainswashed into. Like a virus, Islam has managed to spread and infect a generation after generation. And now it is spreading to Europe, which is very worrysome. It's disheartening that there are only three Muslim nobel prize winners in science. Moreover, the grave of the first one, Pakistani Prof. Dr. Abdus Salam, was vandalized, with the word "Muslim" scratched off his tombstone simply because he belonged to the Ahmadi sect, a smaller faction within Islam. That is how much Muslims appreciate developement. Abdus Salam should be the pride of Muslims, but instead Muslims reject him because he happened to interpret the quran in a different way. As a Tunisian who was raised as a Muslim , I have been exposed to the true face of the said religion. Fortunately I grew up in the West and with an access to information, and thus managed to heal from the mind rot of Islam. Unfortunately not many of the new generation Muslims (especially in Western countries) are capable of doing the same, and the danger of societal isolation and Islamic pockets forming within society are real. Sweden is an excellent example of what happens when you don't take the danger of a iron age ideology seriously. It really saddens me to see the misery of people who have been oppressed by Islam and its disgusting teachings. Iran for example can be considered as a failed nation, thanks to decades of oppression by their islamic government. Saudi-Arabia is dragging its feet when it comes to human rights, and so does Yemen, Libya, Oman, Jordan, Iraq, Pakistan etc. In Afganistan women are not allowed to even go to school thanks to the religious Talebans. Wherever Islam spreads, misery and sorrow follows. And don't get me started with "Western influence". Westerners realized the dangers of following a medieval ideology and taking it literally, and thus they tamed it down and stopped following its teachings literally. That is why they went ahead while Muslims wallowed in their own Islamic regression. If Muslims had been smart enough to do the same, we might not have so many failed states in Middle-East filled with death and destruction.

Also to all Muslims reading this: Instead of taking this rant as an attack, think through it. Research and read more. Share

Stopped reading after islam causing poverty lol

Not allowing woman to work, forbiding modern banking and financial institutions, and general belief that this is only worldly matters and we should pursue only the afterlife.. Breeding uncontrollably because fortune was guaranteed by allah.. How is that not causing poverty???

More people in the workforce leads to less jobs.

Modern banking literally takes from the poor and gives to the rich...

Logic does not work with people indoctrinated with propaganda.

significant poverty, intense tribal conflicts, unimaginable atrocities, human rights violations,

This is mostly happening because of either muslims or western countries.Islam doesn t have anything to do with this، it fobids racism، injustice and cruelty

Men and women are different and yes islam doesn t treat them equally, it treats them justicely.

conflicting with modern values

Who says that modern values are the best standard for morality. Modern values are changing and you can be wrong about a lot of things, why are liberals treating it like a divine ideology.

of the prominent Islamic golden age scholars,

Do you have any proof to support this argument.

Sweden is an excellent example of what happens when you don't take the danger of a iron age ideology seriously

You r talking about sweden the country that allows only the burning of the quran and kidnaps the childen of muslims.

Afganistan women are not allowed to even go to school thanks to the religious Talebans

Again it s muslims not islam.

Wherever Islam spreads, misery and sorrow follows

You already disproved your argument by admiting have been a scientific hub.

Utter garbage. Islam is a cancer to the west. Even the Prophet Muhammad was a paedophile.

There are verses in the quran and islamic sources that directly instruct muslims to kill, convert, or subjugate, christians, jews, polytheists, and non-believers and you’re you suggesting that Muslims are the issue rather than addressing concerns about these specific teachings within the Quran itself? Find out who Mutazilla were, why Islamic Golden Age ended and why and how the "West" managed to get the upper hand. Think for a while, why human rights are important and why free societies prosper.

No, you are lying. I read Quran and you didn’t and then wonder why we call you islamophobes. You’re just taking verses out of context, SIMPLE contexts.

Read it again. You can't sit here and blatantly lie like we don't have access to the information. What is written is written so for you to deny it clearly shows that you're ashamed of the truth. Your truth.

Surah 3:151: "We shall cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve

Surah 2:191: "And kill them (non-Muslims) wherever you find them … kill them. Such is the recompense of the disbelievers (non-Muslims)."

Surah 9:5: "Then kill the disbelievers (non-Muslims) wherever you find them, capture them and besiege them, and lie in wait for them in each and every ambush …"

Surah 47:4, “So, when you meet (in fight with) those who disbelieve, strike at their necks till you have killed and wounded many of them, then bind a bond firmly (and take them as captives). After the war lays down its burden, then either show generosity (free them without ransom), or ransom (to benefit Islam). But (Allah adapted this way) in order to test some of you with others. Those who are killed in the way of Allah, Allah will never let their deeds be lost.”

Surah 9:5, “When the forbidden (4) months of Islamic calendar have passed, then fight the polytheistic wherever you find them, capture them, besiege them, and prepare for them each, and every ambush. But if they repent, offer prayers perfectly, and give obligatory charity, then leave their way free. Surely Allah is forgiving merciful.”

Surah 9:29, “ Fight against those who do not believe in Allah, nor in the last day, nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allah and Allah's messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of truth (Islam) among the people who were given the scriptures, until they pay the security tax willingly, and feel themselves subdued.”

Surah 2:216, “Fighting (in Allah's cause) is ordained for you (Muslims) though you dislike it. It may be that you dislike a thing and it is good for you, and it may be that you like a thing and it us bad for you. Allah knows, but you do not know.”

Ayo you’re commenting every 10 min on a comment I left a month ago go do something useful instead of hating

Hey dude I looked up every one of the verses you mentioned, turns out it’s really your speciality to take things out of context. See you in jahanam

Quoting 3 verses from Surah At-Tawbah when the Surah was literally revealed in a time of oppression against the Muslims when multiple peace treaties had just been broken against the Muslims and they were being attacked from multiple directions...

Anything wrong with 3:151? That will simply be part of their ordained punishment on and after the Day of Judgment.

Well then you clearly didn’t read the part where I said that “I grew up muslim” (that if you read anything at all except for the title) and assuming I didn’t read it is straight up ignorant. Mohamed was a warlord, a child rapist, and obviously a false prophet. That’s even if he existed in the first place.

Allah is an enemy to unbelievers. - Sura 2:98

Slay them wherever you find them and drive them out of the places whence they drove you out, for persecution is worse than slaughter. - 2:191

Fighting is obligatory for you, much as you dislike it. - 2:216

I could go on for hours.

Crazy how brainwashed the Muslim community is to defend such disgusting morals.

This is insane, you literally just proved my point. You think just because you grew up Muslim you can talk about Islam like you know everything.

You literally said that Quran stated to kill non believers and yet you only mentioned one verse that orders to kill them, and wow! What a surprise! It was taken out of context like I said.

Fight in the cause of Allah those who fight you but do not trangress limits for Allah loves not the transgressors. (Quran 2:190)

So the verse before the one you mentioned clearly states that you have the fight the ONES WHO FIGHT YOU FIRST, but of course you guys like to lie and invent things in your head. YOU DID NOT READ THE QURAN.

I m almost certain that they have nothing to do with islam as a religion.

Think for a while, why human rights are important

How does this help prove your point.islam also gave human right

free societies prosper

There s no free society.Islamic ideal society would be also somewhat free.And again you acknowledged the islamic golden age when muslim society prospered.

Muhammad married a 7 year old and rap Ed her at 9 years old. Disgusting paedo prophet.

If you need to lie to yourself that's fine. That's your journey to take, but to sit here and lie to Muslims like we don't know what out religion teaches is fkng laughable. Either you don't pay attention or you are indoctrinated beyond repair. Either way I pray you find deliverance from your sick and evil ways.

The topic of Religion and its effects on society is pretty complicated and cannot be summarized in a comment or a single post, some people think a good socioeconomic state brings a good side of religion, some people think religion results in a bad socioeconomic state. There are different examples for each argument, and there are plenty of counterarguments too, though I agree for the most part, in modern days, we don't need religion to obtain morality. It is the pther way around, religion often brings the worst side of humans.

i think it totally depends on how you interpret religion. I myself strongly object to even mentioning religion in relation to the political system but i think its social effect when paired with good education will only benefit society. and I dont see a better source for moral value

not far from what you view this is how i see religion

Culture and tradition not religion.

A lot of 'culture and tradition' comes from religion

Endless examples of religion being the source of many cultural practices: - Holidays and religious ceremonies (Eid, ramdhan, mouled) - Rituals and traditions: circumcision, el zdé9 fel jema3, funerals - Social structure and hierarchies: patriarchy and "honor culture" related to the chastity of women - Art/architecture: islamic sufi chants, islamic architecture - Cuisine and dietary practices: halal conditions for food - Clothing/dress code: hijabs, you need to dress modestly etc

Come on guys, let's appreciate the fact that the bro just summarized all the 2010s responded-to arguments in one brief post

Well, I guess I should be flattered to have condensed an entire decade's worth of responses into one post. Who needs nuanced discussions anyway, right?"

u are right admin islam is a cancer to humanity

> It's disheartening that there are only three Muslim nobel prize winners in science.

We don't seek knowledge for the prizes, attention and a means to feed our egoes, we do it for the sake of Allaah as His messenger has recommended us to do so.

You are absolutely correct. People who downvote you are either stupid or they don't want to face the reality.

imagine saying this on reddit and not expecting down doots. didnt you know the islam overlords rule here?

Iran is not even Muslim, Afghanistan isn't following Islam as it is permissible for both women and men to educate themselves and who are they to deny that right?

"not following islam properly" is what every Islamic reformer has said in every century. Yet, Islam still keeps being used to murder, suppress and pillage people. When you see a pattern like that, you should feel that something is not right, no?

Ahmadiyyas are not even Muslims...

What about Judaism and Christianity ? What about the Amish community? The Pro-Israeli conservatives . You are so biased towards hatred rather than rational analysis of what is actually going on.

Couldn't agree more 💕

indonesia is a very muslim country and has a very strong economy and so does india (not muslim but quite religious and way more traditional than your average north african country) on the other hand a lot of socialist countries like the USSR promoted atheism and aimed to create a scientocracy still failed economically and certainly socially im not religious myself but blaming religion for all thats wrong with society isnt the right approach ,most of what caused tunisia's problems for instance is corruption and the lack kf education. And I do believe religion could be a problem in many situations but its absence is not a good long-term solution and its not like the west is a paradise especially on the social and ethical side.

Your argument is notably shallow, neglecting crucial aspects of Indonesia's reality. Indonesia's so called economic success doesn't overshadow the glaring issues it faces. Rampant political corruption, blatant human rights violations, and simmering religious tensions. The enforcement of stringent blasphemy laws and occasional outbreaks of religious conflicts underscore a society struggling with fundamental challenges. Ignoring these substantial drawbacks is to paint an incomplete and overly optimistic picture of Indonesia's reality.

the argument was only used to refute ur claim of certain economic failure in the presence of religion ofc Indonesia isnt heaven on earth in fact corruption human rights violations and societal tensions are present in many countries regardless of religious presence(ussr example again) , you could see that clearly daily in the US aswell between the left an the right race issues lgtb issues etc. What you've totally missed is that my point isnt to argue for the utopia religion would bring our society, i acknowledge that it could be harmful similar to any ideology or even in sth as simple as supporting sports teams , whenever you have a non homogenous society(always) you're bound to find tension to varying degrees thats just human nature.

Your response is off-target. Recognizing societal tensions in diverse settings doesn't excuse sidestepping the criticism of Islam and its harmful behaviors. Bringing up issues in the US doesn't diminish the need to address the specific concerns raised about certain religious practices. Let's stay on track. The focus is on critiquing Islam's actions, not diluting the conversation with general societal tensions.

i wouldnt say its off target. u literally insinuate that islam is to blame for the failure of arab countries specifically which is blatantly false. You can criticize things u dont like about islam its totally fair but even Nietzsche for instance when criticizing Christianity still acknowledged the good it brought society

You can use stronger arguments, yours are very poor, especially describing muslims etc... You sound angry towards this religion i think it's kinda extreme ( maybe i'm wrong), the debate is do people need religion to be moral ? I think they don't , and if they are moral only because of religion then that would make them have 0 emotional intelligence because they act ou of ( خوف و طمع) actually mentionned in this exact way in the holy book... The debate is complex, people shouldn't be trying to convince others whether to be muslim or atheists or whatever, it's a very personal matter and not relevant in daily life unless s.o hurts another person in the name of an idea whether its religion or atheism.

If my arguments seem poor, perhaps it's because you're operating on a lower education level, and my solid points are just a bit out of reach. Let's clarify, I'm not spouting random anger; these are real-time, substantiated facts. I'm not pushing my views with a narcissistic agenda; I'm simply stating verifiable facts. It’s not about spreading negativity fueled by resentment; it's about presenting events as they are.

If you lack the intelligence to understand the topics at hand that is a reflection of you, not others.

Nah that's more like of the religious brainrot person

Bit ignorant to assume my lifestyle. Average religious brain rot, y’all are all the same

The irony of not even being able to provide a solid argument to contradict my statements, I know right.

You’re validating your own delusions my dude. Sure, believe whatever you want, but don't push your agenda onto me. Not being able to eat in a restaurant during ramadan is a restriction on personal freedom. People on the streets throwing slurs “miboun” “hardous” “rabi yehdik”, and sometimes even getting violent, just because you don’t conform to social norms is a restriction on personal freedom. Promoting the notion that young girls should conceal themselves as a response to perceived difficulties with men's sexual instincts, instead of addressing the underlying issue through educating young boys is a restriction on personal freedom. Did the light bulb of comprehension finally flicker on? Respect goes both ways.

Also, I've included the NSFW tag, so if you're prone to getting easily butthurt, a simple scroll would have sufficed. Religion, like any other philosophy, is open to criticism and discussion, it’s part of the broader discourse surrounding diverse beliefs and perspectives. But somehow the only ones who manage to always get butthurt and get on the defensive are Muslims.

There hasn't been any mention of engaging in unruly behavior, behaving disrespectfully, or insulting others' faith in a reckless manner. You’re making that up in your head. Nahki ala haja bsita kima t9oul l sahbek yabda yemchi bahdhek f chera3 “ynaan din rabek” w yasm3ek chkoun.

Yeah you are "clearly" not Islamophobic LOL. Read this guy's comments in his post alone and tell me he is just being critical. Kinda crazy how mods allow this.

It worries me whenever I see people supporting Islam and accusing critics of that vile religion like me with islamophobia. Muslims, as to be expected, have jumped along with this victim mentality and are using the term "islamophobia" with passion. No matter how much data or proof you present to prove your point, in the end you receive the verdict of islamophobia

You are Islamophobic because you preconceived opinion which is that Islam is a vile religion that is not based on something which I just proved in my other comment, which makes you prejudice of Islam aka an Islamophobe.

You just learned something new today.

Countries with a significant Islamic population, they're quite questionable, wouldn't you say? Not exactly known for being peaceful, tolerant, or welcoming. Women are treated like shit, gay people even worse. It's not by chance that a considerable proportion of terrorists are associated with Islam, and numerous Muslim-majority nations, like Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Pakistan, exhibit oppressive governance and alarming human rights shortcomings. Quite ironic for a so called "religion of peace."

This isn’t a prejudice or a preconceived notion; it's a statement based on my own firsthand encounters. Savor the delights of that exquisite victimhood, won't you?
