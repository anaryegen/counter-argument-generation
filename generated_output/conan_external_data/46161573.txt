UK Police withheld bombshell report revealing how gangs of Muslim men were grooming more than 100 schoolgirls as young as 13 in case it inflamed racial tensions

By Pamela Geller - on June 26, 2015

I said it just yesterday in connection with another report about how British police covered up the activities of Muslim rape gangs: They did nothing and they still do nothing. One of the victims did a comprehensive interview with me here and here. She had over 100 names of rapists and traffickers, but the police “didn’t have time” to take all the names. She went to police just last April — this coverup is still happening, which is just one of many indications that Britain is in its last days as a free society.

“Police withheld bombshell report revealing how gangs of Muslim men were grooming more than 100 schoolgirls as young as 13 in case it inflamed racial tensions ahead of General Election,” by Martin Robinson, MailOnline, June 25, 2015:

Britain’s second largest police force withheld a report about gangs of Muslim men grooming children in case it inflamed racial tensions ahead of a General Election, it was revealed today.

West Midlands Police were warned more than 100 predominantly white children – some as young as 13 – were at serious risk of child exploitation five years ago.

A document entitled ‘Problem Profile, Operation Protection’ from March 2010 reveals Asian gangs targeted schools and children’s homes across the force area.

The report, written for senior officers, also reveals how white girls were used to recruit other vulnerable victims on behalf of the gangs.

But there were fears over a row ahead of the May 2010 General Election and an English Defence League rally in April leading to a ‘backlash against law abiding citizens from Asian/Pakistani communities’.

Despite the warnings police did not warn the public or appeal for information about the men responsible and the report was only published this week under the Freedom of Information Act.

In one heavily redacted passage, the document reads: ‘In (redacted) a teacher at a (redacted) that a group of Asian males were approaching pupils at the school gate and grooming them. Strong anecdotal evidence shows this MO (modus operandi) is being used across the force.

‘Operations in other forces have identified an MO where offenders use a young girl in a children’s home to target and groom other residents on their behalf.

‘This has also been evidenced within the force in (redacted) and (redacted).

‘The girl’s motivation to recruit new victims is often that the provision of new girls provides her a way to escape the cycle of abuse.’

The report said police had identified a potential 139 victims, 78 per cent of whom were white while more than half were aged 13 to 15.

Half of all victims, who were from Birmingham, Dudley and Walsall, lived with their parents, while 41 per cent were in care.

Police pin-pointed 75 grooming suspects – most with a history of sexual violence – with most being from a Muslim background from Birmingham.

The report stated: ‘The vast majority of identified suspects (79 per cent) are Asian (59 of 75), 12 per cent are white and five per cent are African Caribbean. 62 per cent of Asian suspects are of Pakistani origin.

‘Pakistani males account for half of all identified suspects in the force (37 of 75).

‘Offenders are likely to have a history of previous sexual offences, as well as a wide range of other offences and convictions.

‘A high level of organised criminality has now been evidenced both across the force area and regionally, with multiple offenders working together to identify, groom and abuse victims.

‘In a number of organised groups victims are forced into prostitution and high levels of intimidation and force are used to keep the victims compliant.’

The shocking document also highlighted fears of ‘community tensions’ if the police made the report’s findings public. HOW WEST MIDLANDS REPORT HAS SHADES OF ROTHERHAM SCANDAL

West Midlands Police’s decision to withhold details of alleged child abuse amid fears of increasing racial tensions has shades of the scandal in Rotherham.

Police and social workers in the South Yorkshire town were accused of being too concerned about being labelled racist to speak out about the crimes involving 1,400 children.

Yesterday it emerged that the massive inquiry into the Rotherham sex abuse scandal could run until at least 2018 and has so far identified 300 suspects.

Investigators say the number of possible offenders is changing on a ‘daily basis’ and they suspect ‘thousands of offences’ have been committed.

The team has seized 92 boxes containing several thousand files and identified more than 3,300 lines of inquiry. The suspects are ‘predominantly’ Asian men from the South Yorkshire town and include two who have worked for the council. Their victims are mainly white, British, underage and ‘vulnerable’ girls.

Operation Stovewood is currently costing up to £5million every year, and is still likely to be ongoing in three years’ time – putting the total bill for the inquiry at around £15million.

So far the inquiry has backed an original estimate that 1,400 girls were abused in Rotherham during a 16-year period from 1997 to 2013.

Last night children’s charities demanded that the men should be brought to justice.

Barnardo’s chief executive Javed Khan said: ‘Because so many vulnerable children were ignored by the authorities, groomers got away with exploiting them for years.

‘Ensuring the cases against groomers go to trial is vital in giving sexually exploited children confidence that the justice system does work for them; that if they come forward, they will be believed and supported’.

It stated: ‘The predominant offender profile of Pakistani Muslim males… combined with the predominant victim profile of white females has the potential to cause significant community tensions.

‘There is a potential for a backlash against the vast majority of law abiding citizens from Asian/Pakistani communities from other members of the community believing their children have been exploited.

‘These factors, combined with an EDL protest in Dudley in April and a General Election in May could notably increase community tension.

‘Police will be criticised if it appears we have not safeguarded vulnerable children, investigated offences and prosecuted offenders.’

The lengthy report concluded authorities in the West Midlands needed to improve its care of missing care home children.

It stated: ‘There is strong evidence in the vast majority of all cases that the victims are enticed, stupefied or controlled by alcohol and a mixture of controlled drugs.

‘The victims are already suffering from health conditions relating to their chaotic lifestyle and exploitation (Pregnancy, termination, STDs, neglect, and physical and psychological problems).’

West Midlands Police Assistant Chief Constable Carl Foulkes said: ‘These reports, spanning six years, give a real insight into the journey we have undertaken along with our partners into investigating and tackling child sexual exploitation.

‘There is no doubt that there has been a significant cultural change within the force in respect of this issue and it is now very clear that the responsibility of tackling CSE (child sexual exploitation) lies with every police officer, staff member, PCSO and special constable.

‘The force has carried out extensive work to train officers across the force in how to identify and deal with CSE so we can gain as much intelligence as possible and thereby improving the outcomes for victims.

‘We continue to take great steps and as a result of our efforts and without doubt the coverage within local and national media, we are seeing more victims coming forward to report abuse, knowing we will take their allegations seriously and treat them sensitively and respectfully.’

As of this writing, some Islamic…gentlemen tried to decapitate the workers at a chemical factory in Grenoble, France. They cut off some guy’s head earlier and hung it on the factory’s fence with Islamic writing on his beheaded head. Did the people in that chemical factory that was attacked have to taunt their would be beheaders? Couldn’t they have converted to Islam so as not to taunt these two Isis beheaders? This attack shouldn’t have happaned at all. After all, Charlie Hebido said the terrrorists were forgiven and said that they at Charlie Hebido had the right to draw their lousy, unimaginative cartoons of Mohammed, but Pamela Geller and crew could not draw their far superior cartoons. Why doesn’t appeasement of the Muslims work in France or Massachusetts? /sarc

these police that cover this up – need to be arrested – they need be brought before the courts and face the consequence. their cowardly actions are responsible for the harm done to these yourng girls. these muslim rapists need to be deported to their birth country, if they are born in the UK then jailed for life. thats my belief.

Reply to jackmasters

I completely agree. They didn’t do their jobs. If they didn’t have the integrity to do the right thing, then they should have resigned from their positions. They still have a chance to redeem themselves by standing up and publicly confirming the deplorable state of organized crime in the UK.

How did you make your Disqus profile here totally unresponsive?!

These cop(out)s and their political owners need to be raped to death in public with sharp wooden poles.

This is the problem with mass immigration; we’ve invited people en mass from third world countries of subcontinental Asia and Africa who have a massive rape culture where women are treated as sex objects and specific to Islam they’re instructed to act like a man who married a 6 year old and raped here when she was 9. The country is full of Muslim ghettoes and African ghettoes who come from a rape culture where women are fair game, so if you’re unfortunate enough to see an area near you become a filthy ghetto then you’re at risk. However if you state these facts you’re considered a racist, thanks Labour, thanks spineless lefties of my generation, this once great country is beyond repair.

Not all Muslim men are child-rapists, but…

The population of Rotherham is 257,280, of which 3.7% are Muslim, that is 9500 in total.

If one in five of these is an adult male (probably an overestimate knowing how muslims breed) that gives 1900.

Of these 1900 adult Muslim males, at least 300 are KNOWN predatory pedophiles. That gives a minimum rate of 16%.

Now extrapolate to the whole of England…

http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/586677/Rotherham-child-abuse-scandal-300-more-suspects-identified-by-police-so-why-no-arrests

There was a case in Germany where a non-muslim girl was gang raped by 4 muslims. Her father had them hunted down. Their balls and penis were cut off and stuffed in their mouths. They were shot dead and thrown in a river. The families of these four disgusting demons went back to Pakistan.

I’m sure everyone reading this is thinking. That’s fantastic! and so am I.

That’s where we’re at in 2015. My god, what happened to our civilized world!

F’g muslims. Religion of peace my A**.

When society does not offer justice to victims of crimes, it results in people taking the law into their own hands. One cannot blame them.

You have given me hope, Alissa.

We should do that to all of them.

The use of the term “Asian gangs” in the newspapers slanders all Asians. These are not Asian gangs, they are Muslim gangs. Does this slander all Muslims? No. Islam condones this behavior. The newspapers that use the term “Asian gangs” are beyond contemptible. And one cannot feel anything but revulsion towards the police involved in the cover-up. They have proven that they are not officers of the law, but rather participants in rape and child molestation. It is time for the parents of victims to assume responsibility for the enforcement of justice. Yes, this would be horribly wrong in a civilized state in which police acted as policemen are supposed to, but this situation has descended into barbarism. Exposure has improved nothing. These criminals in blue should be taught to understand what their jobs are in a most severe and violent manner. All is lost in Britain.

Muslims are all seditionists who don’t believe in ANY sovereign national governments, identifying both them selves and all others by religion not origin.

So why do the treasonous and supine Brits call muslims “Asians!”?

Only Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran are in Asia.

Arabia, Iraq and Turkey are in Asia Minor.

ALL the rest of the islamic countries are in Africa.

Reply to UncleVladdi

Thank you Uncle Vlad. Excellent observation. To answer your “Why?” I would say it’s because the British authorities are tripping over themselves and their tongues in a frantic effort to protect Islam by keeping the public ignorant. The tactic of attempting to twist the language in that effort is both hilarious and infuriating at the same time. I have tried to think of a comparison to illustrate the point, but what the newspapers and British authorities are doing is so absurd and blatantly dishonest that comparisons become trite. When it comes to their own children, apparently most Brits just don’t give a damn. It’s time the Brits who do care initiated a revolution, and send the dolts who “run” the country to the gallows.

Reply to Canadian Patriot

The gallows is too good for them. I suggest impaling them all.

Clearly , the police in the U.K don’t get cause and effect. They witheld a report , worried that to release it would inflame racial tensions. What do they think will happen when the general public find out what was happening for over ten years ? THAT will inflame racial tensions. Perhaps a fire below the surface, but it’s there.

Masochistic, excuse-making idolaters choose to ignore cause and effect.

Reply to UncleVladdi

What about it? It’s to show solidarity with the St. Andrew’s “Southern” Cross flag, which represents State resistance to false, overbearing Federal “Authority.”

Reply to UncleVladdi

Does it for you mean an automatic anti-semitism , or it it social myth that this is the case ?

Even taken at its worst face-value “racism,” I fail to see how Southern US Billy-Bobs and Bubbas were anti-Semitic at all. As Democrats, they were generally against freed black slaves. Tony modern metrosexual liberals are today’s anti-Semites; you know, urban and suburban BDS University professor types.

Even the use of the word ‘grooming’ is inappropriate. They are kidnappers, pimps and rapists. They should be prosecuted, convicted and deported.

IslamDownpressesHumanity

Stories like these make me wonder what goes on in Dearbornistan’s “justice” system these days.

Reply to IslamDownpressesHumanity

I don’t understand. Where are all the American far-right, patriot groups. NOW we DO need them.
