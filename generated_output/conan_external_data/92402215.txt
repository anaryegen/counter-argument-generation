General health advice

Healthy holiday tips (Healthdirect Australia)

Not all medications available over the counter or by prescription in Australia are available in other countries. Some may even be illegal or controlled substances, even if prescribed by an Australian doctor.

If you plan to bring medication, check if it's legal in the UK. Take enough legal medication for your trip.

Carry a copy of your prescription and a dated letter from your doctor stating the following:

what the medication is

your required dosage

that it's for personal use.

Check the UK Home Office for advice about medication.

Health risks are broadly similar to those in Australia.

NHS information and advice

The standard of medical facilities is similar to that of Australia.

Call the National Health Service (NHS) on 111 to find your nearest GP surgery or hospital.

If you need urgent medical care, go to your nearest hospital.

Accessing NHS medical services

There's a reciprocal healthcare agreement between Australia and the UK.

Some GP and hospital treatments are free if you're in the UK for a short visit.

Check the Department of Human Services to find out what's covered. You'll need to prove you're eligible.

If you stay for over 6 months, you'll pay an Immigration Health Surcharge, which will be charged when you apply for your visa.

Your details will be shared with the NHS when your visa is approved, allowing you access to medical care.

When you access healthcare in the UK, you may need to:

provide your biometric residence permit if you have one

prove your status online using a share code if you have a digital immigration status.

There may be delays in accessing medical treatment through the NHS.

The NHS won't cover the cost if you need a medical evacuation. Medical evacuation can be very expensive. Get comprehensive travel insurance before you leave Australia.

You're subject to local laws and penalties, including those that appear harsh by Australian standards. Research local laws before travelling, especially for an extended stay.

If you're arrested or jailed, the Australian Government will do what it can to help you under our Consular Services Charter. But we can't get you out of trouble or out of jail.

Penalties for possessing, using or trafficking illegal drugs are severe. They include imprisonment and fines.

Carrying or using drugs

Controlled substances (GOV.UK)

Some Australian criminal laws still apply when you're overseas. If you break these laws, you may face prosecution in Australia.

Staying within the law and respecting customs

The UK recognises dual nationality.

Visas and border measures

Every country or territory decides who can enter or leave through its borders. For specific information about the evidence you'll need to enter a foreign destination, check with the nearest embassy, consulate or immigration department of the destination you're entering. 

Make sure you meet all entry and exit conditions. The Australian government can't help you if you don't.

If you're travelling to the UK as a tourist for less than 6 months, you usually won't need a visa.

If you're travelling to the UK for other purposes, seek guidance from the UK's Visa and Immigration Service on obtaining a visa.

Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA)

The UK is introducing Electronic Travel Authorisations (ETAs) for all visitors to the UK.

From 8 January 2025, Australians who don't currently need a visa for short stays or don't already have a UK immigration status will need an ETA to travel to the UK. You can apply in advance starting 27 November.

An ETA permits multiple visits to the UK for stays of up to 6 months at a time over 2 years or until the holder's passport expires, whichever is sooner.

An ETA does not guarantee entry to the UK. See Apply for an electronic travel authorisation (ETA).

Online Immigration Status (eVisa)

UK Visas and Immigration is replacing physical documents (such as Biometric Residence Permits) with online immigration status records – known as eVisas.

The documents being replaced are:

biometric residence permits (BRP)

biometric residence cards (BRC)

passport endorsements, such as indefinite leave to enter wet ink stamps

vignette stickers in passports, such as entry clearance or visa vignettes.

For more information, see Online Immigration Status (eVisa) 

The UK can refuse entry without a visa if they think you're trying to enter for reasons other than tourism. You'll need a visa if you plan to do paid or unpaid work, volunteer or get married. Arrange this before you travel.

Australian Government officials can't help you change your UK visa status.

Entry and exit conditions can change at short notice. Contact the UK High Commission for details about visas, currency and customs. 

You can usually use eGates on arrival in the UK (free of charge) if you:

have a biometric symbol on the cover of your passport; and

are aged 10+ with an Australian ePassport (10 to 17 year olds must be accompanied by an adult).

You don't need to complete a landing card.

You must see a Border Force officer and get your passport stamped if you're coming to the UK with a Temporary Work - Creative Worker Certificate of Sponsorship for short-term assignments (up to 3 months).

Read the Guide to faster travel through the UK border, as these requirements can change at short notice.

UK airports have extensive security screening. Allow extra time if you're flying to or transiting through the UK. Check UK Department of Transport for details.

Check UK Visas and Immigration for details. Also, check the UK's hand luggage rules.

Contact your airline or travel provider for more details.

The UK and the EU provide updated guidance on the implications of Brexit for issues such as travel, residency, education and employment. The latest information can be found on the websites of the UK Government and the European Commission.

Some countries won't let you enter unless your passport is valid for 6 months after you plan to leave that country. This can apply even if you're just transiting or stopping over.

Some foreign governments and airlines apply the rule inconsistently. You can receive conflicting advice from different sources.

You can end up stranded if your passport is not valid for more than 6 months.

The Australian Government does not set these rules. Check your passport's expiry date before you travel. If you're not sure it'll be valid for long enough, consider getting a new passport.

Lost or stolen passport

Your passport is a valuable document. It's attractive to people who may try to use your identity to commit crimes.

Some people may try to trick you into giving them your passport. Always keep it in a safe place.

If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the Australian Government as soon as possible:

In Australia, contact the Australian Passport Information Service.

If you're overseas, contact the nearest Australian embassy or consulate.

Passport with 'X' gender identifier 

Although Australian passports comply with international standards for sex and gender, we can't guarantee that a passport showing an 'X' in the sex field will be accepted for entry or transit by another country. Contact the nearest embassy, high commission or consulate of your destination before you arrive at the border to confirm if authorities will accept passports with 'X' gender markers. 

LGBTQIA+ travellers 

The official currency is the Pound Sterling (GBP).

ATMs are available and credit cards are widely used. Contactless payment is widely accepted.

If you're travelling to or from a non-European Union (EU) country, declare cash of more than 10,000 euros or equivalent. This covers all forms of currency, not only cash.

You may have to pay a penalty if you don't declare this cash.
