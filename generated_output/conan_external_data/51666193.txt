Serial killers: I. Subtypes, patterns, and motives

Laurence Miller, in Aggression and Violent Behavior, 2014

5 Typologies of serial killers

Considering the amount of clinical and criminological attention that has been devoted to serial killers, it should not be surprising that a plethora of typologies has been developed to classify different types of perpetrators. The more well-known typologies are described below to illustrate the commonalities in observations among different researchers studying the same phenomenon.

Dietz (1986, 1987) has proposed a typology that divides multiple murderers into five categories:

Psychopathic sexual sadists kill for the sheer pleasure of torturing and murdering their victims in a sexual way. This has also been termed lust murder or erotophonophilia (Hickey, 2003; Schlesinger, 2004). This is probably closest to the classic serial sexual homicide perpetrator that is the subject of most descriptions. Examples include Ted Bundy and John Wayne Gacy.

Crime spree killers embark on one or more jaunts of murder, usually in association with other crimes, most commonly robbery, but they also derive a thrill from the power and opportunity to flaunt authority that their acts entail. An historical example would be Bonnie and Clyde. A fictionalized cinematic portrayal appears in the 1994 film, Natural Born Killers.

Organized crime functionaries consist of professional or semiprofessional “hit men,” individuals who kill primarily for money, although they almost certainly enjoy a sense of power and control from being in this line of work. Other examples would include political assassins and territorial dispute killings by rival criminal gangs (Schlesinger & Miller, 2003).

Custodial killers murder vulnerable victims who are supposed to be in their care. The most common examples include “angel of death” cases involving nurses in hospitals or nursing homes who surreptitiously murder ill or elderly patients, usually by asphyxiation or medication overdose. This group is likely to contain the highest number of female serial killers. An historical example is “Jolly” Jane Toppan, a nurse who, from 1895 to 1901, killed at least 31 hospital patients in Massachusetts (Raine, 2013).

Psychotic killers murder under the influence of some form of delusion, such as defending themselves against malevolent pursuers (persecutory delusion) or receiving a divine command to rid the world of certain types of people (grandiose delusion).

Another widely-used typology of serial killers (Holmes & De Burger, 1985, 1988; Holmes & Holmes, 1996) uses the following descriptors:

Spatial mobility killer. This typology maintains a clinical and forensic distinction between geographically stable serial murderers who live in one area and kill in that same or a nearby area, and geographically transient murderers who travel to other locales to commit their crimes.

Visionary serial killer. This type of killer is induced to murder by delusions and/or command hallucinations which impel him to act. His victims are typically strangers, and his psychotic state at the time of his crimes sometimes results in the invocation of an insanity defense. This type appears closest to one variety of Dietz's (1986, 1987) psychotic killer, discussed above.

Mission serial killer. This may represent another type of Dietz's psychotic killer, who is following a religious or political imperative to eradicate a certain group of people. In the Holmes classification, the mission killer need not be grossly psychotic, but simply affected by what would be described as a delusional disorder in DSM-5 (APA, 2013), or he may have no diagnosable mental disorder at all and may simply be acting on an extreme ideological belief that it is necessary to eliminate some identifiable class of “bad” people.

Comfort-oriented serial killer. This killer's motive for murder contains at least some utilitarian purpose. It may include the hired assassin who kills purely for profit or the individual who murders family members for financial gain, in which case the profit motive may be admixed with feelings of hatred and revenge.

Hedonistic serial killer. This is the type of serial murderer who derives sexual pleasure from the act of killing, which is usually prolonged and contains acts of mutilation, torture, dismemberment, and/or necrophilia. This is probably closest to Dietz's psychopathic sexual sadist, as well as to the classic description of the serial sexual homicide perpetrator.

Power/control serial killer. Similar to the above type, this murderer derives pleasure from the prolonged torture and killing of another human being, but here the emphasis is more on the control and domination aspects of the killing than the sexual component per se. Of course, there is likely to be a great deal of overlap between these two categories.

A empirical study of the Holmes serial murderer typology was carried out by Canter and Wentink (2004), based on an analysis of crime scene evidence from 100 U.S. serial murders. They found limited support for aspects of the lust, thrill, and mission serial killer categories, and features of the power/control serial killer were found to generalize to serial killers as a whole, rather than forming a distinct type. The findings suggested that more attention should be paid to styles of interactions with victims, such as use of restraints, torture, mutilation and theft of property, rather than just inferring the motivations of individual offenders.

5.3 Rappaport typology

Rappaport's (1988) typology describes five types of serial killers:

Spree killers kill a series of victims during a continuous span of murder and are basically similar to Dietz's and others' descriptions of the crime spree killer.

Functionaries of organized criminality are the contact killers, assassins, and hit men familiar from previous descriptions.

Custodial killers are medical personnel, foster parents of disabled children, or other caretakers who poison or asphyxiate victims for financial gain, revenge, ideology, or twisted altruism (“angels of mercy/angels of death”).

Psychotic killers murder under the influence of delusions and/or hallucinations, familiar from above descriptions.

Sexually sadistic killers are murderers who derive sexual pleasure through inflicting pain on their victims, which describes both Dietz's psychopathic sexual sadist and Holmes' hedonistic serial killer.

5.4 Sewall and colleagues typology

Recently, Sewall, Krupp, and Lalumiere (2013) have pointed out that the crimes of sexual homicide perpetrators frequently occur in the context of a long and varied criminal history, involving an assortment of petty and violent crimes. Incorporating this data, these authors propose a serial killer typology containing the following three offender subtypes.

5.4.1 Competitively disadvantaged offenders

These are life-long offenders whose criminal careers begin early, often in childhood or adolescence, and involve numerous and sundry crimes, ranging from petty theft to sexual assault and murder. They frequently are developmentally and cognitively impaired, socially disadvantaged, and lead a marginalized, criminal lifestyle. They would probably correspond to the definition of antisocial personality disorder described in DSM-IV-TR and DSM-5 (APA, 2000, 2013). When it occurs, sexual homicide is characterized by an impulsive, angry sexual attack, often in response to sexual rejection, and may begin as an attempted sexual assault that then escalates to murder.

5.4.2 Psychopathic offenders

These offenders also begin their variegated criminal careers early, but they are more neurodevelopmentally intact and able to maintain relatively stable lifestyles coexisting with their criminality. Cold and remorseless, their crimes are likely to involve far more cunning and conning than the previous type, and they would probably correspond to the classic psychopath in criminological literature (Cleckley, 1941; Hare, 1993, 2006). Their primary motivation is the quest for thrills and excitement, which they obtain by manipulating, exploiting, and dominating other people. At times, this may include various forms of sexually sadistic behavior, but deliberate murder is likely to be the exception and, again, may occur in response to sexual rejection or in the course of a sadistic sexual act that gets out of hand.

5.4.3 Sadistic offender

For this perpetrator, preoccupation with sexual torture and murder has become a lifestyle, at first nurtured by fantasies and pornography, later perhaps practiced on animals, and finally expressed in acts against human beings. Intriguingly, this individual may have little or no criminal history beyond his sexual homicides, and he is also likely to possess the controlled predation characteristics of the psychopath, here focused exclusively and intently on his pursuit of gratification through sexual domination, torture, and murder.

5.5 Serial killer typologies: conceptual commonalities

The commonalities of typological descriptions coming from different observers in different times and places attests to a certain construct validity of the categories described by each. These appear to boil down to a basic set of common serial or multiple murderer subtypes:

Sexual sadists who kill for the intense pleasure derived from the domination, control, torture, humiliation, and murder of another human being.

Delusional killers who are on a mission, either frankly psychotic or more ideologically-driven, to rid the world of persons they consider undesirable.

Custodial killers who murder helpless or dependent persons under their care. Note that this group may overlap with the above, e.g. the health care worker who believes that society should not waste resources on sick or disabled people or that God has commanded that it would be more merciful to put them out of their misery.

Utilitarian killers whose motive at least partly involves some practical financial or other material gain, although the motive may be mixed with anger or revenge, as in the aggrieved spouse who wants to put a final end to the wrangling over a bitter divorce.

5.6 Organized–disorganized dichotomy

Probably, the best-known, and increasingly controversial, classification scheme of serial killers is the one developed by the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit (BSU), which divides serial killers into organized vs. disorganized subtypes (Geberth, 1990; Geberth & Turco, 1997; Hazelwood & Douglas, 1980; Hickey, 1997; Palermo & Kocsis, 2005; Ressler, Burgess, & Douglas, 1988; Ressler et al., 1986).

5.6.1 Organized serial killer

This perpetrator is above average in intelligence and considers himself superior to other people. He is meticulous in most aspects of his life and takes great care with personal appearance, grooming, and belongings. His crime is well thought out and carefully planned. The crime is usually committed away from his area of residence or work and he is quite mobile, often traveling long distances to commit his crimes. Fantasy and ritual are important to the organized killer, and he typically selects a stranger whom he considers the “right” type of victim in terms of age, physical appearance, behavior, and other qualities. The killer often carries a carefully prepared “torture kit” containing his preferred implements of bondage and mutilation. He may follow and stalk this victim for hours or days, and he may take great pride in verbally manipulating his target into a position of vulnerability. His capture and control of the victim are calculated to afford him maximum power over his hapless prey. Alcohol is often used during the murder. He often takes a souvenir or trophy from his victim that he may later use to relive the event or enhance his fantasies surrounding the killing.

The organized serial killer is often familiar with police procedures and takes great pride in thwarting investigations and taunting law enforcement officials by the careful placement or concealment of evidence. In some cases, he is currently or has formerly worked in some branch of law enforcement or security, or aspired to do so. He may be a “student” of previous or contemporaneous serial killers, reading up on their exploits and even corresponding with them in prison. He typically learns from each of his own crimes and becomes increasingly sophisticated in his predatory and elusive tactics. Although casual observers may describe some serial killers as solitary and strange in their daily behavior, just as commonly he may appear normal and a “regular guy” to coworkers, family, and neighbors.

5.6.2 Disorganized serial killer

This killer is average or below average in intelligence. He is often a loner and a recluse. He is typically an underachiever, feels sexually and interpersonally inadequate, has a poor self-image, and is considered “weird” or “creepy” by acquaintances. He typically engages in such sexual activities as voyeurism, exhibitionism, lingerie thefts, and fetish burglaries, and uses sadistic and fetishistic fantasy and pornography in autoerotic activities. He is less careful about planning, and his crime scenes typically display more haphazard behavior. The violent offense is more impulsive and spontaneous, and the victim is often a target of opportunity. The disorganized killer's crimes lack the manipulation and cunning of the organized killer, and typically consist of “blitz attacks” that are intended to silence the victim quickly through blunt force trauma, following which, death usually follows quickly. Some attacks may be characterized by overkill, with multiple stabs and blows. Postmortem activities with the corpse may include biting, exploratory dissection, mutilation, insertion of foreign objects, or masturbation onto the body, and there may or may not be actual penile penetration of the body. As the name implies, the crime scene is sloppy and disorganized, with minimal effort to conceal the evidence. Trophies are less frequently taken, but there may be a secondary robbery of opportunity.

As with most classificatory systems, intermediate types are frequently found, and sometimes a crime scene has elements of both organized and disorganized categories, in which case it is called mixed (Geberth, 1990; Geberth & Turco, 1997; Hickey, 1997; Ressler et al., 1986, 1988). And, as with most psychological and criminological descriptors that deal with the untidy realities of human nature, authorities are coming to agree that the organized–disorganized system should be thought of more as a continuum than as a rigid dichotomy, and that this information should be utilized as one set of data, along with the other information collected in the course of an investigation (Hicks & Sales, 2006; Palermo & Kocsis, 2005; Schlesinger et al., 2010).Read more

Fame-seeking rampage shooters: Initial findings and empirical predictions

Adam Lankford, in Aggression and Violent Behavior, 2016

Increasingly in America, fame is revered as the ultimate form of prestige-bearing success, and the distinction between fame and infamy seems to be disappearing. In this context, some rampage shooters succumb to “delusions of grandeur” and seek fame and glory through killing. The present study offers initial findings on the behavior of fame-seeking rampage shooters, and then tests for differences between offenders who explicitly sought fame and other offenders. The results suggest that fame-seeking rampage shooters have existed for more than 40 years, but they are more common in recent decades and in the United States than in other countries. On average, fame-seeking offenders appear younger than other rampage shooters, and they kill and wound significantly more victims. Several empirical predictions are made about the expected frequency and characteristics of future rampage shootings.Read more

Hypomania: A depressive inhibition override defense mechanism

Brad Bowins, in Journal of Affective Disorders, 2008

6 Mania: a defense over the edge

In comparison to hypomania, which can be difficult to detect clinically because it is typically adaptive, mania is usually obvious given its maladaptive features (Akiskal and Pinto, 1999). While there is justification in separating these two entities, there is more of a spectrum from mild sub-threshold manifestations of hypomania to hypomania to milder mania to full-blown mania where psychosis dominates the clinical picture (Angst and Marneros, 2001). Somewhere along this spectrum a manic state is identified (Akiskal and Pinto, 1999). Considering that physical and mental over-activity is the key feature of hypomania enabling depressive inhibition to be over-ridden, it is easy to see how this is a defense on the edge. With the brakes off the mental and physical activity accelerate to the point where contact with reality is hard to maintain. For example, thoughts race, attention shifts too rapidly from one stimulus to another, the draw to reinforcers such as sex or drugs becomes irresistible, speech spills out, energy surges to unsustainable levels, and sleep/rest periods disappear.

The main feature distinguishing hypomania from at least full-blown mania is psychosis (mania means psychosis in Greek), such as with grandiose delusions where the person believes he or she has special powers. Setting the stage for such delusions are the positive cognitive distortions that are such an integral part of the mental over-activity of hypomania. In a hypomanic state a person typically has inflated confidence and optimism regarding their capacities and likelihood of success (Akiskal and Pinto, 1999; Eckblad and Chapman, 1986). Eckblad and Chapman (1986) found that while their hypomanic personality subjects displayed higher self-esteem and ambition they did not provide evidence of achievements superior to the non-hypomanic control group, emphasizing the positive cognitive distortion aspect as applied to the self. They also discovered that these individuals put a positive spin on their depressive periods preferring to label them as sadness or feeling down.

More intense distortions of these self-perceptions transform them into delusions. For example, with increased self-confidence during a hypomanic episode a person might believe that he or she has unique insights into religion that need to be shared. With an intensification of this positive cognitive distortion the person develops the belief that the key to religious conversion of the masses resides exclusively in their special God-given knowledge. A positive self-enhancing cognitive distortion has been transformed into a delusion. Akiskal (1996) emphasizes “heightened perceptions” as a cardinal feature of mania. “Coupled with distractible attention and the rush of ideas so characteristic of severe mania, this heightened perceptual set can produce a variety of hallucinatory and delusional experiences.” Gardner (1982) posits that mania arises when the social rank expressed by the individual is out of context with reality. The manic person believes he or she is superior to what the social reality allows, an occurrence that rarely happens in the animal world where competition for higher status is ever present. With humans the social distortion can be hidden for some time and hence grow completely out of context with reality.

Whereas hypomania is generally adaptive, full-blown mania is usually not given the disconnect with reality, disturbed functioning, lost resources, and damaged interpersonal relationships that frequently arise from behavior displayed during this state. However, in all but the most extreme manic states there resides adaptive potential, at least in select contexts. For example, in a completely disinhibited, although still coherent state, a male might seduce a mate or mates not attainable otherwise, or successfully attack a high-ranking individual in the social group to secure privileged resources. With delusions of grandeur a person in a full-blown manic state might attract followers, such as some fringe religion leaders have been known to do, and acquire their resources including mating opportunities. As very clearly seen in clinical practice, though, the full-blown manic state involves disorganized thinking and behavior that reduces adaptive functioning, such as a person acting so belligerent that potential mates stay well clear. Furthermore, delusions of grandeur usually shift to delusions of persecution giving rise to intense fear, further impairing functioning.

If hypomania typically progressed to mania the value of this defense in overriding depressive inhibition would be greatly diminished. Akiskal estimates (1996) that 3–6% of the general population worldwide has hypomania or cyclothymia giving a 1:1 unipolar–bipolar ratio. Sub-threshold hypomanic symptoms conceivable might be even more commonplace. Mania is much less common and is estimated to occur in about 1% of the population (Weissman and Myers, 1978). BP-II likely accounts for at least 50% of all depressions observed in clinical practice (Akiskal, 2005). The greater prevalence of hypomania than mania and it being roughly on par with depression, supports its role as a defense against depressive inhibition. Most of those with hypomania will not develop a manic episode and hence will demonstrate predominately adaptive behavior. Even when there are manic episodes 50–60% will also experience milder hypomanic episodes (Cassano et al., 1992; Coryell et al., 1989). Studying an adolescent bipolar group Klein et al. (1996) found that most remained stable with hypomania and did not progress to mania. Amongst cyclothymics only 6% will develop mania (Akiskal, 1996).

While it is difficult to say why some individuals develop mania, factors such as genetic vulnerability to psychosis and perhaps mania itself, excessive alcohol and drug use common in bipolar disorders (Akiskal et al., 2003), antidepressant-induction, and stress might all play a role, particularly if mania is not preceded by hypomania. It is also feasible that when hypomania fails to override depressive inhibition the physical and mental over-activity will intensify to compensate. At manic levels the volitional inhibition is overridden but at a substantial cost in terms of compromised functioning. Ideally there would be a feedback mechanism, whereby when the costs of defense intensification exceed the value of overriding depressive inhibition, further intensification of the defense ceases. In some individuals with bipolar disorder this feedback mechanism might well operate preventing progression to mania whereas in others it does not work. Conceivably, the presence of this feedback capacity might even distinguish BPII from BPI. Antidepressants, alcohol, and illicit drugs probably impair it, increasing the likelihood of hypomania shifting into mania.Read more

Serial killers: I. Subtypes, patterns, and motives

Dietz (1986, 1987) has proposed a typology that divides multiple murderers into five categories:

Psychopathic sexual sadists kill for the sheer pleasure of torturing and murdering their victims in a sexual way.

PSYCHIATRIC ASPECTS OF SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS

Wendy S. Cohen, ... James L. Levenson, in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (Fourth Edition), 2004

Mania is characterized by euphoria, irritability, or even dysphoria, with mood lability, grandiosity or inflated self-esteem, and speeding up of thoughts (racing thoughts, flight of ideas), speech (rapid, pressured), and activity level (increased goal-directed activity and decreased need for sleep). Hypomania, a milder form of mania, has the same symptoms but does not impair the patient's overall functioning. Manic patients feel they don't require much sleep, in contrast to patients with insomnia, who complain of lack of sleep. During manic episodes, patients often engage in spending sprees, promiscuity, and other risky or thrill-seeking behavior. When severe, mania may be accompanied by psychotic symptoms, such as paranoia and delusions of grandeur. Since manic episodes can closely resemble cocaine, amphetamine, or alcohol intoxication, substance abuse must be ruled out. Antidepressants can precipitate mania in patients with a bipolar diathesis or undiagnosed bipolar disorder (manic-depression). Nevertheless, in patients with SLE, the most common cause of mania is corticosteroid therapy. Like depression and anxiety, mania is a clinical diagnosis. Treatment includes discontinuing offending drugs, such as antidepressants, and if possible, tapering corticosteroids. Mood stabilizers (e.g., lithium, divalproex, and carbamazepine), benzodiazepines, antipsychotic drugs, and occasionally ECT are used in treating acute mania. Mood stabilizers are also employed in the prophylaxis of recurrent manic and depressive episodes.Read more

Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Ester Klimkeit, ... John Bradshaw, in International Encyclopedia of Public Health (Second Edition), 2017

The brain's frontal regions are slow to mature and vulnerable to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and neurodegenerative disorders of aging such as Parkinson's and Huntington's disease. The frontostriatal system involved in neurodevelopmental disorders comprises dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, lateral orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, supplementary motor area, and basal ganglia. These areas are involved in a number of functions such as attention and executive functions (that is, functions such as self-monitoring, planning, organization, flexibility of thinking and inhibition), motivation, control of complex behaviors, and sequencing movements. Below we outline the particular frontostriatal areas involved in different developmental disorders, as well as how attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), depression, schizophrenia, Tourette's syndrome (TS), and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) are characterized clinically, neuropsychologically, genetically, and how they are best treated.

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder

ADHD is an early onset behavioral disorder comprising problems with inattention, impulsivity, distractibility, and excessive motor activity. It is classified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders with three major presentations: predominantly inattentive (20–30%), predominantly hyperactive/impulsive (less than 15%) and combined (50–75%). ADHD occurs in approximately 1–10% of school-aged children and 2.5% of adults. Boys are more frequently diagnosed than girls, with ratios ranging from 2:1 to 9:1.

Diagnosis of ADHD is based on the presence of a sufficient number of symptoms present before the age of 12, and the report that these symptoms impair the child's functioning in at least two settings (home, school). Other than high levels of distractibility and inattention, children with ADHD tend to be disorganized, struggling to follow routines and to complete tasks. They tend to interrupt others, have difficulties following rules, and are often impulsive. Hyperactive children have difficulty remaining seated and are constantly restless and fidgety. These behaviors wax and wane and are influenced by the environment. Symptoms are typically worse in situations requiring sustained attention, mental effort or those that are not appealing or novel.

Between 50% and 80% of children with ADHD also meet diagnostic criteria for other disorders, and generally, the presence of such a comorbid disorder indicates a more serious problem and worse prognosis. The most common comorbid disorders are other externalizing disorders such as oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder, followed by internalizing disorders such as mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and specific learning disorders. Language and speech disorders and OCD are also common. While almost half of individuals with TS also have ADHD, the reverse is not the case. Approximately one-third of children with ADHD also experience ‘autistic-like’ symptoms. Around half will also have Developmental Coordination Disorder which may manifest as clumsiness as well as slowness and inaccuracy of performance of motor skills.

ADHD symptoms usually reduce with maturation, but persist to adulthood in 30–50% of cases. ADHD is a major risk factor for later personality and psychiatric disorders, delinquency, substance abuse, driving accidents and speeding violations, difficulties in adult social relationships, marriage, and employment. Most of these developmental risks are exacerbated by the presence of comorbid aggression/conduct problems.

Treatment for ADHD may include pharmacological and/or behavioral approaches. Early intervention is important for improving outcomes in later life. Stimulant medications like methylphenidate and dextroamphetamine are the most commonly used treatment. They have a positive effect for approximately three-quarters of children with ADHD at least in the short term. Stimulant medications are primarily dopaminergic (although they also affect noradrenergic and serotonergic systems), and treatment is associated with a reduced risk of later substance abuse. Contrary to popular belief that the effects of stimulant medication are paradoxical because ADHD children appear ‘slowed down,’ normally developing children respond to stimulants in the same way, with improved and more focused cognitive function and reduced motor activity.

Antidepressants (tricyclics like imipramine, desipramine; and a noradrenalin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant like atomoxetine) and hypotensives (clonidine, guanafacine) are alternative treatments if children have intolerable side effects or are unresponsive to stimulants. These particular antidepressants primarily act on norepinephrine transmission.

Education of parents about the disorder, training in managing problem behaviors, learning how to manage stress, and social supports are useful for parents of ADHD children and result in reported improvements in the child's behavior. Treatment involving medication is better than behavioral treatment alone, except perhaps for those with milder symptoms. No clear additive effects of combining medication and behavior treatment have been shown.

Executive functioning problems are indicated, with an emphasis on inhibitory deficits and problems with sustaining attention. These individuals typically show slow, variable, and inaccurate responding. They are impaired on tasks requiring inhibition of a response and of distracting stimuli, as well as in thinking flexibly, specifically being able to change response strategies when task demands change (change of set). Planning, word generation, withholding premature responses, working memory, and sustained attention are also deficient. Poor performance on many of these tasks is normalized through stimulant medication. While in the past, the inattentive subtype was thought to be characterized more by problems with processing speed and selective attention, it now appears that the underlying neuropsychological deficits are more similar than different to those with the combined subtype.

ADHD is associated with smaller whole brain volumes, smaller right prefrontal cortex, and structural anomalies in the basal ganglia, cerebellum, and corpus callosum. Functional imaging studies indicate low striatal and frontal activity, particularly on the right, that is partially reversible with stimulant medication. These regions are involved in higher, executive function, such as working memory, rule-based learning and planning. The right prefrontal cortex, is important in editing one's behavior, spatially focusing attention, resisting distraction, and developing an awareness of self and time. Lesions in the prefrontal cortex cause poor attention regulation, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. The basal ganglia act in switching off automatic responses, in coordination and in selecting deliberate actions.

While environmental factors such as birth complications, maternal alcohol, and tobacco use have been indicated, ADHD has a strong genetic component, with heritability estimates ranging from 61% to 98%. The mode of inheritance however, is not clear. Like most psychiatric conditions, ADHD is a complex disorder with several genes, each of minor or moderate effect.

Dopamine transporter genes have been differentially implicated (DRD4, DRD5, DAT1). The dopaminergic system influences motor control, reward, mood, and cognition, and is indicated by the primarily dopaminergic effects of stimulant medication. Dopamine receptors are present in the striatum and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, areas shown in imaging studies to function abnormally. Problems in the dopaminergic system may also help explain the slow responding, poor timing, and clumsiness in ADHD.

The noradrenergic and serotonergic systems are also implicated, and clearly, multiple neurotransmitters may be involved. The study of the role of neurotransmitters is complicated by the interrelationship between neurotransmitter systems: a change in one results in a change in another. Noradrenergic projections are dense in the frontal cortex and cingulate gyrus, regions that subserve alertness and attentional control. Norepinephrine is implicated in working memory, behavioral inhibition, and attention. Low concentrations of noradrenalin in certain regions of the prefrontal cortex are associated with poor concentration, poor self control, and greater motor activity. Serotonergic deficiency is associated with impulsivity and aggression, and serotonin is important in mood control, sleep, appetite, memory and learning, and control of attention and locomotion.

Depression, the ‘common cold’ of psychiatry, has a lifetime risk of between 10% and 20%, with females at twice the risk of males. The mean age of onset of a depressive disorder is between adolescence and the mid-twenties. It is more debilitating than the sadness that everyone sometimes experiences, and different even from grief of bereavement. It may have morbid consequences, with depression being the most common diagnosis in individuals who suicide.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by depressed mood of at least 2 weeks' duration (depressed or irritable mood in children/adolescents) or loss of interest or pleasure in all activities. In addition, a number of other symptoms must be present: Individuals with MDD often become preoccupied with suicide, plagued by guilt, and a sense of worthlessness. They often have difficulty thinking clearly, concentrating, remembering, or making decisions. They may have difficulties sleeping and feel sapped of energy and have trouble sleeping, or instead may want to eat and sleep excessively. They may also have symptoms of psychomotor agitation or retardation (psychomotor symptoms are rare in children/adolescents). MDD can present with anxious distress, seasonal pattern, peripartum onset, or psychotic features (usually consistent with depressive themes). It can also, rarely, present with catatonic features (immobility), melancholic features (lack of reactivity to pleasurable stimuli with worsening of symptoms in the morning, psychomotor retardation, and early morning awakening; this is rare in children/adolescents) and atypical features (reactive mood, increased appetite, excessive sleep, leaden paralysis).

Approximately 3–6% may develop a less acute but more chronic persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), where symptoms of depressed mood and at least two other symptoms (poor appetite or overeating, insomnia or hypersomnia, low energy or fatigue, low self esteem, poor concentration or difficulty making decisions, and feelings of hopelessness) are present most of the day, more days than not for a period of at least 2 years (1 year in children/adolescents). Bipolar disorder, characterized by episodes of mania (marked by a decreased need for sleep, rapid speech, delusions of grandeur, engaging in self-destructive activities such as spending sprees and promiscuous sex), typically commences following one or more depressive episodes. It is rarer than unipolar depression, estimated at 1–1.5%.

Depression is comorbid in approximately 60% of cases, with anxiety disorders being the most common. Substance abuse, eating disorders, conduct, and ADHD are also often comorbid. Comorbid disorders such as anxiety (but not substance abuse) often precede depression. Only two-thirds respond to treatment: 15% fail to recover (with the episode lasting for two or more years). Among those who respond to treatment one-third will relapse during remission. Of those that recover 75% will have a recurrent episode. Only 11% ever have a single episode. Those with depression can expect four to six episodes during a lifetime.

Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and Interpersonal therapy (IPT) are the two empirically validated psychotherapies for adolescent and adult depression. CBT focuses on developing a less distorted/negative thinking style and more adaptive coping behaviors, while IPT focuses on improving effective communication. There is also emerging evidence for the efficacy of Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy in the treatment of depression. However, severe depression usually requires antidepressant medication. There are added benefits with combined psychotherapy and medication treatment. In very severe treatment resistant depression, or with severe illness/suicidality, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is used, involving induction of brief seizures. It is an efficacious rapid treatment, but benefits need to be maintained with maintenance treatment (e.g., maintenance ECT or antidepressant medication). Transcranial magnetic stimulation, the use of a powerful magnetic field to stimulate brain areas such as the prefrontal cortex, and direct transcortical electrostimulation also temporarily ameliorates symptoms.

Antidepressant medications act primarily on serotonin (the serotonergic system plays a role in control of appetite, sleep, memory and learning, control of attention and locomotion, muscle contraction, and endocrine regulation) and noradrenalin. Older tricyclic antidepressants are primarily noradrenergic and especially indicated where psychomotor retardation is prominent, as in the melancholic type. Tricyclics are no more effective than placebo in adolescents, where psychomotor symptoms and melancholic depression are rarely seen. In this group the newer SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are more effective than tricyclics, suggesting that serotonin may be more important in childhood depression. There is recent controversy of the use of SSRIs in children and adolescents, in terms of safety and efficacy. Only fluoxetine (i.e., Prozac/Lovan) and escitalopram (Lexapro) were considered to have an acceptable risk–benefit ratio by the Food and Drug Administration, and warning labels have been issued for antidepressants. Lithium, anti-epileptic mood stabilizers (e.g., valproate) and increasingly, atypical antipsychotics are used in the treatment of bipolar disorder.

Depressed individuals are slower in cognitive processing and responding. Cognitive deficits have also been observed, such as concentration difficulties, learning and memory problems (especially verbal memory); and reduced executive functioning with an emphasis on flexibility of thinking or shifting attentional set. Individuals with depression are also often impaired in planning, word generation, working memory, and inhibition of irrelevant information. While some difficulties disappear in remission (e.g., verbal fluency), others continue to manifest (e.g., inhibition of irrelevant information). Fewer difficulties are apparent in younger individuals. The neuropsychological difficulties in bipolar disorder are similar, but more severe than in unipolar depression.

Structural imaging reveals ventricular enlargement (correlating with cognitive and psychomotor retardation) similar to Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and schizophrenia, together with periventricular white matter lesions, decreased striatal volume, temporal lobe anomalies, and smaller frontal lobe volume. Smaller hippocampus (involved in learning and memory) and enlarged amygdala (involved in emotional functioning) are also reported. Functional imaging studies show lower activity in the anterior cingulate, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and striatum. Increased orbitofrontal activity reflects inhibitory processes and rumination. These brain areas mediate the affective aspects (e.g., orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus), psychomotor aspects (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and cognitive/executive function aspects (anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex).

Individuals with major depression are more likely to have relatives suffering from anxiety, depression, and alcohol abuse. There may be overlapping genetic association between mood disorders and alcohol abuse. While relatives of individuals with bipolar disorder are at increased risk of depression, the reverse is not true. Depression has heritability estimates around 40–70%. Environmental risk factors for depression include stressful life events and childhood neglect/abuse, absence of social support, and low maternal support in childhood.

Various genes have been investigated in depression, including those affecting neurotransmitters such as serotonin and noradrenalin and those that control activities of certain hormones, with unclear findings. Some studies find that stress interacts with serotonin transporter genes in predicting depression, while others do not. Neurotoxic effects, possibly from cortisol released during stress, may damage hippocampal cells (part of the limbic system involved in memory and emotion), resulting in depressive symptoms. After a few weeks of antidepressant treatment the hippocampus may regain mass (neurogenesis). Possibly neuroprotective proteins are also implicated. Depression probably involves an interaction of several genes with environmental events.

TS is a severe form of tic disorder, marked by multiple motor tics and one or more vocal tics that are present for at least 1 year. Tics are sudden rapid, recurrent, purposeless movements or vocalizations/utterances. TS is more commonly found in boys than girls (3:1 ratio) and affects less than 1% of the population. Motor tics usually develop before vocal tics, and these symptoms typically progress over time, becoming more severe and complex. Onset is usually during childhood or early adolescence, and is by definition before age 18. Tics typically develop prior to age 8, peak by puberty, and decline substantially thereafter. In some cases symptoms disappear entirely by adulthood.

Simple motor tics include eye blinking, neck jerking, grimacing, and coughing, whereas simple vocal tics include throat clearing, sniffling, grunting, and barking. Complex tics include licking, head-shaking, throwing, biting, jumping, compulsive touching, compulsive copying of another's actions (echopraxia) or speech (echolalia), obscene gestures (copropraxia), and socially unacceptable utterances (coprolalia). However, coprolalia occurs in less than 15% of cases. Tics are experienced as irresistible but can be suppressed for periods of time, though with an increasing build up of tension. Most individuals are aware of an urge similar to the urge to sneeze or scratch an itch, known as premonitory urges. Tics constantly change in number, frequency, and severity, and are typically exacerbated by stress or boredom and reduce during concentration.

Tics can cause embarrassment and interfere with social interactions, and can sometimes be quite uncomfortable and painful. Self-injurious behavior such as biting, scratching cutting, or hitting are also seen in TS. Some individuals with TS have speech dysfluencies that resemble stuttering. The majority of individuals with TS have symptoms of ADHD, OCD, or both, at some time during the course of their condition. There is considerable overlap between TS and OCD, in that in both conditions the repetitive behaviors are considered to be involuntary (although for both there is some degree of voluntary control), tension is experienced if the behavior is inhibited, and relief is reported as the behavior is carried out. TS is also comorbid with problems of poor impulse control and an inability to control anger, learning disorders, and anxiety and depression.

Management involves medication, behavior therapy, and for a minority of severe cases, surgery (involving for example, deep brain stimulation of the thalamus and globus pallidus internus). The main aim of treatment is to achieve a degree of control of tics allowing the individual to function as normally as possible and to relieve tic-related embarrassment or discomfort. Most cases of tic disorders such as TS are mild and are considered not to require medication. Behavioral therapy such as habit reversal (e.g., practicing muscular movements opposite to the tic) and exposure with response prevention (patients learning to resist or delay the tic response to the unpleasant premonitory sensation, resulting in learning to tolerate the unpleasant sensation (habituation), which lessens the urge to give into the tic, resulting in a reduction of tic behavior) are the most promising approaches. Often it is the comorbid conditions like ADHD that cause greater impact, and these comorbid disorders are often the reason for help seeking. Medications useful in treating tics target dopaminergic systems by blocking dopamine receptors. Thus antipsychotics (e.g., ‘typicals’ like haloperidol, and newer ‘atypicals’ like risperidone) are considered the most effective anti-tic agents, but are often associated with unwanted side effects. Variable efficacy has also been shown for antihypertensives such as clonidine.

Increased rates of eye blinking and poor handwriting (similarly found in ADHD) suggest mild impairment in motor control. There is some evidence for difficulties with respect to visuomotor integration (e.g., copying complex designs) and in motor coordination, as well as deficits in eye movement control. Early studies suggested executive function deficits. However, these deficits may be related to the comorbid symptomatology of OCD and ADHD. Studies comparing neuropsychological performance of individuals with TS with and without comorbid ADHD or OCD symptomatology, suggest more extensive impairments in those with comorbid disorders and only mild cognitive deficits in the ‘pure’ form. There is debate that rather than widespread executive deficits, deficits in TS may be more inhibitory in nature, though if so, and precisely which inhibitory processes are involved, requires further investigation.

In TS cortical and basal ganglia involvement is implicated. Reduced caudate volumes and cortical thinning (observed in frontal and parietal lobes, but particularly in the sensorimotor cortex) correlates with tic severity. Neuroimaging studies show anomalies of the basal ganglia and activation changes in the ventral striatum, orbitofrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate. The basal ganglia normally gate release of behaviors, with TS probably reflecting excess facilitation of unintended (and inhibition of intended) actions. Tics involve activity of not just motor areas, but also oculomotor, language, limbic, and cognitive/executive areas. During periods of tic suppression, decreased activity is observed in the ventral globus pallidus, putamen, and thalamus, and increased activation in areas involved in the inhibition of unwanted impulses: the prefrontal, parietal, temporal, and cingulate cortical areas. Prior to tic occurrence, paralimbic areas are activated (anterior cingulate, insular cortex, supplementary motor area – receiving input from basal ganglia – and parietal cortex) and as the tic commences sensorimotor activation occurs in the superior parietal cortex and cerebellum. Interestingly, paralimbic and association areas are not just implicated in tic generation, but also with movements triggered internally by unpleasant sensations such as pain or itching.

TS is thought to be a genetically heterogeneous condition, encompassing a complex combination of monogenic, multigenic, and environmental factors. Environmental factors influencing the expression of TS include infection, maternal stress, and nausea during pregnancy. Monozygotic twins have concordance rates of 50–70% (that is if one identical twin has TS there is a 50–70% probability that the other will also have TS) and dizygotic twins around 10–20%, suggesting a strong genetic component. Initially, autosomal dominant transmission was reported, but more recently a complex inheritance pattern has been suggested, where many genes are likely to contribute to the expression of TS. No causative genes have been identified, with many inconsistent results between studies. Early onset OCD may be genetically linked to TS. While similarly, a genetic relationship of ADHD to TS has also been proposed, more recent studies suggest the common form of ADHD does not share genetic factors with TS.

Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

OCD is characterized by uncontrolled, recurrent, intrusive thoughts, impulses and images (obsessions), accompanied by feelings of urgency or catastrophe, leading to repetitive, time-consuming, and ritualistic behavior (compulsions), which are typically an anti-anxiety attempt to avert fear or distress. The obsessions and compulsions cause marked distress, are time consuming or interfere with the individual's normal routine, job or social activities. There is often variable insight into the reasonableness of the obsessions and compulsions. The disorder is equally common in males and females, and age of onset is typically around or before puberty in males and in the 20s in females. Lifetime prevalence is estimated to be around 2.5%.

Unlike obsessive compulsive personality disorder, with its characteristic perfectionism and scrupulosity, where individuals derive pleasure from their obsessions and compulsions, those with OCD typically feel distress and anxiety. The frequency of common obsessions has been calculated as: fear of contamination (e.g., becoming contaminated by handling money; 45%), pathological doubt (e.g., wondering whether one has left the oven on; 42%), somatic concerns (36%), need for exactness, symmetry, or evenness (31%), fear of committing acts of aggression, which unlike in psychopathy are not carried through (28%), sexual or religious obsessions (e.g., a recurrent pornographic image; 26%). Individuals with obsessions usually attempt to suppress such thoughts or to neutralize them through another thought or action, i.e., compulsions. For compulsions, the figures are: checking (63%), washing or cleaning (50%), counting (36%), need to ask or confess (31%), symmetry and precision until position or number of repetitions are ‘just right’ (28%), and hoarding (18%). Factor analysis suggests the following groupings: aggressive and somatic obsessions with checking compulsions; preoccupations with symmetry and exactness involving counting, ordering, and arranging rituals; fears of contamination or illness with washing or cleaning rituals; sexual and religious obsessions. The last, unlike the others which may change over time, tend to be particularly stable.

Because obsessions are distracting, this may result in inefficient performance in tasks that require concentration. In addition many individuals may avoid objects or situations related to the content of the obsessions, and for some performing compulsions may become a major activity leading to severe disruption to occupational functioning and relationships. Disorders commonly comorbid with OCD include depression (67% life-time rate), simple phobia (22%), social phobia (18%), eating disorder (17%), problems with alcohol (14%), panic disorder (12%), and TS (7%).

The tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine, which has serotonergic and noradrenergic action, and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (such as fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, and fluvoxamine) are effective treatments. There is controversy over whether clomipramine is more effective than the SSRIs. Behavioral treatments such as exposure and response prevention (this involves gradually learning to tolerate the discomfort associated with not performing the ritual behavior) are effective, compared to control relaxation treatments. Cognitive therapy challenges irrational beliefs and has also been shown to be effective. Cognitive behavior treatments are associated with greater long-term gains (despite not entirely eliminating symptoms) than medication treatments, where relapse is highly probable upon stopping medication. Randomized controlled trials are required to clarify whether or not there is any additional benefit of medication and psychological treatment, but is believed to be the treatment of choice for severe OCD, for patients who struggle to tolerate the anxiety associated with behavior therapy. For patients with severe OCD who do not respond to medication or psychological treatments, psychosurgery (anterior capsulotomy, anterior cingulotomy, subcaudate tractotomy, or limbic leucotomy) is a last resort.

Individuals with OCD respond more slowly, and their performance on set-shifting, response inhibition, and motor suppression tasks (measures of executive function) correlates negatively with the frequency and intensity of their compulsive behaviors. A recent meta-analysis has shown large effect sizes for non-verbal memory deficits and medium effect sizes for deficits in attention, executive function, and processing speed. Executive functions were significantly associated with non-verbal memory, suggesting that non-verbal memory deficits may be more related to executive functioning and less with memory impairment per se. Small effect sizes were noted for deficits in working memory and visuospatial abilities.

Several specific brain regions are implicated, the basal ganglia (particularly the caudate and striatum), orbitofrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate, plus perhaps temporal lobe and amygdala, which may provide the emotional features. Caudate volume is reduced and overactivity of the orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, and right striatum is observed. However, there are many inconsistencies in the literature. These brain areas play an important role in the inhibition of inappropriate responses, executive functioning, for over-riding predominant response patterns, and for error monitoring and detection.

OCD has heritability estimates around 27–65%. While the mode of inheritance remains unclear it is likely to be polygenic with a number of vulnerability genes. Environmental factors such as pre and perinatal events and infection also play a role in its expression. Genes of serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate systems have been investigated in OCD. The most promising results implicate a locus on chromosome 9, which is associated with controlling the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate.

The relationship between OCD and TS may imply a common genetic background, although the TS genes may not be the only mode of acquisition of OCD.

Autism Spectrum Disorder

The essential features of ASD include impairment in reciprocal social communication and social interaction, and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. These symptoms are present from early childhood (typically recognized between 12 and 24 months), but intervention and compensation strategies may mask difficulties in some contexts until later in life. Regression or stasis of language and social behavior is reported for about one-third of children usually between the ages of one and two. Manifestation of ASD varies greatly depending on the severity of the condition, and it encompasses disorders previously known as childhood autism, high-functioning autism, autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder, pervasive developmental disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder and Kanner's autism. The reported frequency of ASD has increased over the recent years, approaching 1% of the population. The disorder is more common in boys than girls (4:1), however, cognitively able girls may be under-diagnosed due to less severe social-communicative impairment. Approximately 50% of individuals with ASD also have an intellectual disability. Seizure disorders, ADHD and anxiety disorders are also common.

Individuals with ASD typically show deficiencies in social-emotional reciprocity (e.g., not participating in social play, impaired awareness of the needs of others, reduced sharing of interests or affect) and deficits in developing and understanding relationships (ranging from an absence of interest in peers, difficulties in sharing imaginative play, or making friends, to difficulties in adjusting behavior to suit different social contexts). Deficits in nonverbal communication include poor eye-contact, lack of facial expression, and deficits in understanding and using gestures. Many individuals with ASD also have verbal language deficits, ranging from a complete lack of speech through to a language delay, poor receptive language, or stilted and overly literal language. Developmentally inappropriate echolalia (copying another's speech) and pronoun reversal, reduced prosody and intonation, and impairments in the use of figurative language are also associated with autism.

Restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped behaviors manifest as an intense preoccupation with a single subject or activity, adherence to nonfunctional routines or rituals, stereotypies, and motor mannerisms, e.g., hand or finger flapping, and body rocking. Disturbances in sensory modulation may also be observed, for example, under and over-reactivity to sensory stimuli. Motor impairments are common and include delayed gross and fine motor coordination, motor stereotypies, deficient postural control, and imitation/praxis impairment. Challenging behaviors such as self-injury and aggression are also often present.

ASD is a life-long condition and therefore treatments need to be tailored to the individuals' particular developmental needs. In general, treatments meet criteria for best practice if they include a combination of educational, behavioral, communication and social skills training approaches, together with medication if indicated. For example, a comprehensive treatment plan might include: teaching new skills using positive reinforcement, the provision of an individually designed school-based educational program; social skills training tailored to the child's intellectual and language abilities, and skills training for the parents of children with autism to provide them with appropriate skills to promote their development. Medication may be prescribed to target specific comorbid symptoms, e.g., SSRIs like fluoxetine to treat anxiety/depressive symptoms, stimulants to treat hyperactivity, while antipsychotics such as risperidone and aripiprazole have been shown to be beneficial in reducing repetitive and challenging (e.g., aggressive and self-injurious) behavior.

There are three main cognitive theories of ASD: ‘theory-of-mind,’ the ‘executive dysfunction’ theory, and the theory of ‘weak central coherence.’ Deficiencies in theory-of-mind – that is, the ability to understand that other people have unique perspectives and thoughts which are sometimes contextually independent – may be linked to the social-communicative deficits. Weak central coherence, a deficit in the ability to integrate details into a coherent global perception, may be linked to the tendency to be preoccupied with parts of objects and to miss the ‘bigger picture.’ Executive functioning refers to the role of the frontostriatal circuits in coordinating cognitive-motor output so that behavior is well timed, planned, adaptable, appropriate, and relevant. The repetitive, stereotyped, and restricted behaviors may be due, in part, to deficient executive functioning. Neuropsychological deficits in executive function tasks requiring the orienting of attention, response inhibition, and set shifting have been shown in ASD. Movement abnormalities in ASD, in particular, gait (walking) abnormalities may be underpinned by disruption to neural circuitry involving the basal ganglia and cerebellum.

No consistent neuroimaging marker has been identified for ASD. Structural changes in the brains of individuals with ASD include: a slightly increased average brain volume; decreased gray matter volumes in the limbic system (important for social cognition); reduced neuron numbers in the vermis of the cerebellum; decreased corpus callosum volume; and gross structural changes in cerebellum and the parietal lobes (important for efficient attention). Consistent with the executive functioning and neuromotor impairments associated with ASD, functional imaging has revealed decreased activation in the highly interconnected cortical and sub-cortical frontal structures, including lateral and medial premotor cortex, frontal eye fields, caudate, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate, suggesting disruption to multiple frontostriatal circuits. More recently, studies have focused on investigating the hypothesis that ASD is associated with atypical structural and functional connectivity, producing a system that is ineffective for complex information processing.

Heritability estimates for ASD range from 37% to 92%, based on twin concordance rates. For dizygotic twins the concordance for ASD is up to 10%. Advanced parental age, low birth weight, and in utero exposure to valproate, thalidomide, and misoprostol have been associated with increased risk of developing ASD. While the cause of ASD for the majority of individuals is unknown, genetic causes can be identified in 15–25% of children with ASD. Identified genetic causes may be classified as microscopically visible chromosome abnormalities (2–5%; these have been identified on almost every chromosome, but 15q duplications are among the most commonly observed), submicroscopic deletions and duplications (10–20%; most commonly involving chromosomes 15q11-q13 and 16p11.2), and single gene disorders (5%; most commonly Fragile X syndrome, Rett syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, and PTEN mutations).

Schizophrenia is characterized by psychosis (disturbances in thinking and perception), apathy, withdrawal, and cognitive impairment. Schizophrenia affects emotional reactivity, interpersonal relations, perceptual processes, attention, information processing, and thought. Its psychosocial impact is devastating at an individual, family, and societal level. The prevalence of schizophrenia is between 0.5% and 1.5%. Recent studies suggest a small, but significantly higher, incidence of schizophrenia among men compared with women when stringent classification criteria are applied. Onset is typically in young adulthood, later in females. Comorbid anxiety and substance related disorders are high, with over half smoking cigarettes regularly, as in Huntington's disease.

Individuals experience a combination of ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ symptoms, which interfere with interpersonal relations, work or education, or self-care over (at least) a 6-month period. Key ‘positive symptoms’ include: delusions (distortions of thought content), hallucinations (perceptual anomalies), and disorganized thinking, language, and behavior. An example of a ‘delusion’ might be the belief that someone has ‘inserted’ a thought into one's head or ‘broadcast’ a thought from one's own mind to others.' Hallucinations are commonly auditory, for example, ‘hearing voices’ which are so intense that they are interpreted as being of external origin. Disorganized ‘thinking,’ measured clinically by the patients' verbal output, is often referred to clinically as the ‘single most important feature of schizophrenia. ‘Negative’ symptoms essentially refer to restrictions in the range and intensity of one's ability to express emotion (affective flattening), a reduced ability to produce fluent thoughts and ideas (alogia), and a reduced ability to form and achieve particular life goals. The negative symptoms of schizophrenia account for the increased suicide rate, estimated at 5–10% of all those diagnosed with the disorder. The main determinants of quality of life are depression and negative symptoms (not active psychosis).

Individuals may shift between positive and negative symptom types during the progression of the disease, for example, commencing with an exacerbating phase of largely positive symptoms, followed by a plateau phase, where the severity and frequency of positive symptoms stabilize, followed by a remission of hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized behavior with evolution of worsening negative symptoms. Individuals may experience a single psychotic episode which is followed by more or less total recovery, or suffer repeated psychotic episodes, with subtotal recovery, or more commonly, experience a course progressing to chronic disability.

The first line of treatment is pharmacotherapy. In the past pharmacotherapy was concentrated on controlling positive symptoms, using first-generation antipsychotic medications which block dopamine D2 receptors. This was followed by greater use of atypical antipsychotic medications (e.g., clozapine), which were deemed more effective than conventional antipsychotics, as well as yielding a more acceptable side-effect profile. More recently however, studies have indicated that some first-generation antipsychotics are on par with those from the second generation. Antidepressants and mood stabilizers (e.g., lithium) are commonly used in treatment. Compliant medication use sets the scene for effective psychosocial interventions including: family psychoeducation, social skills training, cognitive-behavior-therapy, and substance abuse treatments.

Schizophrenia is associated with multiple cognitive deficits, including executive dysfunction (most notably working memory), problems with attention, concentration, psychomotor speed, learning, and memory. Working memory problems and attentional difficulties may underlie the positive and negative symptoms. For example, distortions in perception and thinking may emerge from a difficulty in being able to ‘hold’ and ‘manipulate’ cognitive information long enough to reference an actual experience, as compared to emergent associated memory. Similarly, negative symptoms such as a reduced ability to set and execute daily goals may be underpinned by a difficulty in maintaining an initial plan of action. Many of the cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia manifest during remission, and are therefore considered as core features as opposed to state deficits apparent only during psychotic phases. Similar to autism, research using retrospective video footage has identified subtle neuromotor features which are apparent prior to clinical onset. Additionally, upper-body bimanual coordination deficits have been systematically documented.

Structural and functional brain imaging studies reveal three consistent neuropathological findings; (1) hypofrontality (i.e., decreased neural activity in the frontal regions), (2) enlargement of the lateral ventricles and decreased brain tissue, for example, gray and white matter deficits have consistently been found in the left superior temporal gyrus and the left medial temporal lobe, and (3) reduced hippocampal volume. Impairments in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex are responsible for core cognitive deficits, most notably working memory. The hypometabolism of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate are linked to negative symptom severity, while hypermetabolism of the temporolimbic cortex has been linked to positive symptomatology. Abnormalities have also been reported in neuron density, number, and size in the nucleus accumbens, substantia nigra, thalamus, locus coeruleus, and pedunculopontine nucleus, basal ganglia, thalamus, corpus callosum. The highly salient clinical feature of disorganized thinking is thought to be underpinned by connectivity abnormalities between the multiple neural sites identified in schizophrenia.

Schizophrenia is highly heritable. The monozygotic co-twin of an affected individual has an estimated risk of 60–84%, whereas that of a dizygotic co-twin is around 14%. There is an 8% risk if a sibling has the disorder, 12% if one parent, and 40% if both parents are sufferers. Advanced parental age, pregnancy/birth complications, and substance abuse are also associated with higher risk of schizophrenia. Genetically, there is likely to be a spectrum of risk alleles, common and rare, with each allele contributing only a small fraction to the total population variance. The risk alleles identified are also associated with other disorders such as autism, bipolar disorder, ADHD, and epilepsy. One of the strongest known risk factors for schizophrenia is characterized, for example by involvement of chromosome 22q11, with approximately 20–30% of individuals with 22q11 microdeletions developing schizophrenia or a related psychiatric condition (e.g., schizoaffective disorder). Overall the data suggest that schizophrenia may be one type of phenotypic expression of neurodevelopmental disorder, with its form dependent on a combination of genetic (rare, common and polygenic) and environmental factors, and possibly chance.Read more

Trevor Silverstone, in Biological Aspects of Affective Disorders, 1991

This chapter focuses on the subject of mania. Mania is a serious psychiatric illness that affects almost 1% of the population at some time in their lives. In most patients, mania alternates with depressive episodes, but in others, it recurs without any intervening depression. Mania is characterized by an elevated or irritable mood, overactivity, and increased talkativeness accompanied by a reduced need for sleep, racing thoughts, distractability leading to flight of ideas, an inflated self-regard sometimes amounting to grandiose delusions, and extravagant, disinhibited behavior. Mania, with its exhausting overactivity, bellicose self-confidence, racing thoughts and flight of ideas, is clearly the consequence of a serious disturbance of function within the brain. While a number of neuroendocrine changes have been observed in mania, most are probably secondary epiphenomena, although a pathogenic role for endogenous or exogenous steroids cannot be ruled out. All these mechanisms may play a part in the pathogenesis of mania, with some being more significant in certain patients than in others. It is likely that the relative benefits of a particular treatment in a given patient are determined by which neurological system is most affected in that patient.Read more

In Meyler's Side Effects of Drugs (Sixteenth Edition), 2016

Mirtazapine is a potent histamine H1 receptor antagonist and is perceived by patients as being sedative. While this may improve disturbed sleep, it also has implications for daytime psychomotor performance. The effect of mirtazapine (15 mg at night for 2 days, then 30 mg at night for 2 days) and paroxetine (20 mg in the morning for 5 days) has been studied in a placebo-controlled, crossover design in 12 healthy volunteers (10 women, 2 men, median age 26 years) [4]. On the fifth day the subjects undertook a battery of psychomotor tests. Mirtazapine significantly impaired several aspects of psychomotor performance and increased daytime sleepiness, while paroxetine did not. These results suggest that patients who take mirtazapine should be warned about its deleterious effects on psychomotor performance, particularly driving. It is likely that tolerance to this effect will occur, but the time course of adaptation is uncertain. Also uncertain is how far these results in healthy subjects can be extrapolated to depressed patients, many of whom will have performance deficits due to poor sleep, which could conceivably be helped by mirtazapine.

Worsening of seizures has been attributed to mirtazapine in a patient stabilized on phenytoin [5].

A 50-year-old woman with simple partial seizures and secondarily generalized tonic–clonic seizures, occasionally precipitated by fever, took phenytoin 200 mg/day for 11 years and was seizure free. She then developed a low mood, anhedonia, pessimistic views about the future, anergia, and insomnia and was given mirtazapine 7.5 mg/day. After taking one dose of mirtazapine, she had two partial motor seizures with secondarily generalized tonic–clonic seizures while asleep. The following night, after a second dose she had another similar episode. Mirtazapine was withdrawn and she was given escitalopram. Her seizures did not recur.

The mechanism of this effect is not understood. Mirtazapine does not alter the metabolism of phenytoin, and in any case the event occurred too quickly to be explained kinetically. There is no evidence that mirtazapine is itself epileptogenic. A pharmacodynamic interaction of mirtazapine with phenytoin could have been responsible.

Some patients appear to develop manic symptoms in response to some antidepressants but not to others. Psychosis was reportedly triggered by mirtazapine in a patient taking long-term levodopa [6].

In one patient hypomania occurred [7].

A 45-year-old woman had a long history of dysthymia and depression. She had taken many antidepressants, including tricyclics, SSRIs, amfebutamone, and venlafaxine. She had no history of mania or hypomania. She took sertraline 250 mg/day, with only a transient response, and mirtazapine 15 mg/day was added. Within 4 days she developed clear symptoms of hypomania, with euphoric mood, mild grandiosity, pressure of speech, increased energy, and a reduced need for sleep. Mirtazapine was withdrawn and sertraline continued; within 3 days the hypomanic symptoms had remitted. The depressive disorder then re-emerged.

Unlike most other antidepressants, mirtazapine does not inhibit the reuptake of monoamines, but instead blocks inhibitory α2-adrenoceptors. It is conceivable that this pharmacological mechanism led to hypomanic symptoms in this patient.

Adding mirtazapine to a serotonin reuptake inhibitor may increase its antidepressant effects and is more likely to cause a switch to a manic phase.

A 66-year old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic renal insufficiency, unstable angina, and osteoporosis, but no history of mania, hypomania, or major depression became depressed, irritable, and agitated and was given fluoxetine 20 mg/day. Her feelings persisted and she was switched to mirtazapine 30 mg/day, without a period of tapering off, washout, or cross-titration. Three days later, her self-esteem was inflated and her irritability, agitation, and argumentativeness had worsened. She slept less but was energetic and talkative. After 6 days she developed vivid grandiose delusions with religious content. Her mood was elated and labile. After 8 days she had become violent and uncooperative. She asserted that she was free from all physical illnesses and could save her country and help all people rise to higher levels, spiritually and materially. Her speech was pressured and she was elated. Mirtazapine was withdrawn and valproate and low-dose risperidone begun. Her manic symptoms subsided gradually during the next 2 weeks.

The authors suggested that because of its long half-life fluoxetine might have persisted in the body after withdrawal and inhibited the metabolism of mirtazapine or produced a pharmacodynamic interaction [8].

In 2003, the UK’s then Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM), based on the report of an Expert Working Group, issued advice on the use of antidepressants in children, saying that the balance of benefits and harms in the treatment of depressive illness in those aged under 18 was unfavorable for paroxetine, venlafaxine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram, and mirtazapine [9]. This advice was then reproduced in the British National Formulary (BNF), under the heading “Depressive illness is children and adolescents”, followed by the sentence “Clinical trials have failed to show efficacy and have shown an increase in harmful outcomes”. In the BNF, this statement was followed by a paragraph on the risk of self-harm and suicidal thoughts due to SSRIs in those aged under 18 years, and it was possible to assume from this that it was a risk of suicidality that was also the problem in the benefit to harm balance of mirtazapine.

However, the report of the CSM Expert Working Group makes it clear that it was other adverse reactions that formed the basis of its advice on mirtazapine. The Group reviewed data from two randomized controlled studies in 258 subjects, aged 7–17 years, who were treated for 8 weeks; 170 took mirtazapine 15–45 mg/day and 88 took placebo. Neither trial supported the view that mirtazapine was efficacious. There were no long-term controlled data for analysis. There were no deaths in the trials. In the controlled trials, nine patients taking mirtazapine (5.3%) stopped taking treatment because of an adverse event, compared with three of those taking placebo (3.4%). Weight gain (32% versus 3.4%), somnolence (39% versus 6.8%), headache (35% versus 23%), fatigue (19% versus 11%), increased appetite (8.8% versus 2.3%), urticaria (12% versus 6.8%), and hypertriglyceridaemia (2.9% versus 0%) were reported more often in those taking mirtazapine. There was one case of suicidal thoughts among those taking mirtazapine and one case of self-mutilation among those taking placebo. In another analysis the calculated odds ratio for self-harm and suicide-related events from these data was 0.51 (95% CI = 0.03, 8), i.e. a non-significant reduced risk [10]. However, this conclusion was based on only one event in a small cohort.

In the CSM report the odds ratios for the risks of suicide-related events in those aged 18–29 years were 1.3 (95% CI = 0.4, 6.9) for mirtazapine versus placebo and 2.0 (95% CI = 0.9, 4.1) for mirtazapine versus active controls. Furthermore, in an analysis of data from 41 controlled trials in 2618 patients with major depressive disorder who took mirtazapine, 388 who took placebo, and 2035 who took an active control (maprotiline, sertraline, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, or citalopram) for an average of 4.4 weeks, there were five completed suicides on mirtazapine and 22 patients had non-fatal self-harm or suicidal thoughts. In the placebo group there were no completed suicides and three patients with non-fatal self-harm, and in those who took active controls there were three completed suicides and eight patients with non-fatal self-harm or suicidal thoughts. In the placebo comparisons the odds ratio for all suicide-related events was 1.3 (95% CI = 0.4, 6.9) and for non-fatal self-harm 0.5 (95% CI = 0.1, 2.8), i.e. no significant effect. There was a suggestion of a higher incidence of suicide-related events with mirtazapine in those who had a suicide risk at baseline, but this finding was driven by suicidal thoughts and was based on only four patients. The Expert Working Group concluded that “The analyses performed do not suggest that young adults (defined as those aged 18–29 years) treated with mirtazapine are at an increased risk of suicide, non-fatal self-harm and suicidal thoughts compared with the overall population.”

In another analysis, two cases of possible suicidal behavior or ideation were identified among 170 mirtazapine-treated subjects, and one event of possible suicidal behavior or ideation among 89 placebo-treated subjects [11]. The relative risk estimate for the possible suicidal behaviour or ideation was 1.58 (95% CI = 0.06, 38), again a non-significant result.

The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK then asked the company NV Organon in The Netherlands to carry out an analysis of the risks of suicide, self-harm, suicidal ideation, and possible self-harm in 24 placebo-controlled studies of mirtazapine in major depressive disorder, based on reported adverse events [quoted in 12]. In 7544 subjects who took mirtazapine there were 201 cases of suicidal behavior, accounting for a total of 1490 person-years of exposure. In 934 patients who took placebo there were 22 cases of suicidal behavior, accounting for 130 person-years of exposure. The incidence per 100 person year exposure was 13 (95% CI = 12, 15) for mirtazapine and 17 (95% CI = 11, 26) with placebo, a non-significant difference. However, there were different study selection criteria and definitions of suicidality-related events in the different studies, and interpretation of the results was therefore difficult.

A similar systematic review of 15 short-term, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies in 1827 patients (mirtazapine 1132 patients, mean age 38 years; placebo 695 patients, mean age 39 years), using the suicide item scores from the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale as a proxy outcome measure for the risk of suicidality, showed a statistically significantly lower risk with mirtazapine compared with placebo (OR = 0.38; 95% CI = 0.21, 0.66) [12]. However, the data were not analysed according to the age of the subjects.

In other systematic reviews, second-generation antidepressants, such as mirtazapine, have been included in heterogeneous groups, and mirtazapine alone has not been studied.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reported that the relative risk of definitive suicidal behavior and ideation (excluding non-suicidal self-harm) for all SSRIs in studies of major depression was 1.41 (95% CI = 0.84, 2.37), and that this increased to 1.71 (95% CI = 1.05, 2.77) when venlafaxine, mirtazapine, and nefazodone were also considered [13].

In a systematic review of FDA clinical trials data for nine antidepressants (fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, venlafaxine, nefazodone, mirtazapine, sustained-release bupropion, extended-release venlafaxine, and citalopram) in 48 277 patients with depression, there were similar suicide rates among those randomly assigned to an SSRI (0.59%; 95% CI = 0.31, 0.87), a standard comparison antidepressant (0.76%; 95% CI = 0.49, 1.03), or placebo (0.45%; 95% CI = 0.01; 0.89%); the authors concluded that there was no overall difference in suicide risk between antidepressant- and placebo-treated depressed subjects in controlled trials [14]. In a nested case–control study in 146 095 individuals with a first prescription of an antidepressant for depression, including tricyclic and related antidepressants, SSRIs, and other compounds (flupentixol, mirtazapine, reboxetine, tryptophan, venlafaxine, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors), there were 1968 cases of non-fatal self-harm and 69 suicides. The adjusted odds ratio of non-fatal self-harm for the group of other compounds was 0.99 (95% CI = 0.76, 1.29) and that of suicide 0.80 (95% CI = 0.16, 4.06) [15].

Currently, the Summaries of Product Characteristics for mirtazapine issued in the UK [16–19] feature statements such as the following:

“Mirtazapine should not be used in the treatment of children and adolescents under the age of 18 years. Suicide-related behaviours (suicide attempt and suicidal thoughts), and hostility (predominantly aggression, oppositional behaviour and anger) were more frequently observed in clinical trials among children and adolescents treated with antidepressants compared to those treated with placebo. If, based on clinical need, a decision to treat is nevertheless taken, the patient should be carefully monitored for the appearance of suicidal symptoms. … It is general clinical experience that the risk of suicide may increase in the early stages of recovery. … A meta-analysis of placebo-controlled clinical trials of antidepressant drugs in adult patients with psychiatric disorders showed an increased risk of suicidal behaviour with antidepressants compared to placebo in patients less than 25 years old.”

Some omit the information about those aged under 18 years [20].

However, these statements may be purely precautionary. The statement about those aged under 25 years seems to refer to studies of antidepressants in general and not specifically mirtazapine, and the evidence summarized here suggests that at worst the question is still open and that it is currently likely that there is no increased risk with mirtazapine. Of course, this does not alter the view, as stated by the CSM originally, that the balance of benefit to harm is unfavorable, because of lack of efficacy and other adverse reactions.

A 61-year-old man and a 79-year-old woman developed profound hyponatremia (sodium 112 and 113 mmol/l) 7 and 10 days after starting to take mirtazapine for depression [21]. Investigations excluded other causes, and withdrawal of mirtazapine led to recovery of sodium concentrations to at least 132 mmol/l after 7 and 10 days respectively. The authors graded the likelihood that mirtazapine had caused hyponatremia in these cases as “probable” according to the Naranjo criteria. A review of published cases showed that mirtazapine-associated hyponatremia occurs in patients aged over 60 years, after a mean of 6.5 days, and with doses as low as 7.5 mg/day. The sodium concentration fell to a mean of 117 mmol/l and after withdrawal of mirtazapine the mean time to recovery was 11 days.

Mianserin can occasionally cause peripheral edema [22,23], including facial edema [24]. Pyridoxine may reduce this adverse reaction [25].

Mirtazapine is an analogue of mianserin, which has been associated with an increased risk of agranulocytosis.

A 44-year-old woman with major depression was given mirtazapine 30 mg/day. She had a normal white blood cell count (6.8 × 109/l) [26]. After 3 weeks she complained of a sore throat, difficulty in swallowing, and an aphthous ulcer in the mouth. Her temperature was slightly raised (37.7 °C) and her white cell count was 2.2 × 109/l, with a granulocyte count of 1.1 × 109/l. Mirtazapine was withdrawn and she was given sultamicillin 375 mg bd. Within 2 weeks her white cell count had risen to 3.8 × 109/l, with a granulocyte count of 3.2 × 109/l. Four weeks later she was treated successfully with sertraline while her white count continued to rise.

The neutropenia in this case was consistent with an effect of mirtazapine. This is presumably an uncommon adverse effect, but this case reinforces advice that patients taking mirtazapine should be advised to report any sore throat, fever, or stomatitis.

During clinical trials two of 2796 patients (0.08%) developed neutropenia, but both recovered after withdrawal. No other cases were detected in postmarketing surveillance of 13 500 patients in the Netherlands [27].

Mirtazapine has been associated with asymptomatic increases in liver enzymes [28].

Pancreatitis is a rare complication of many drugs. Recurrent pancreatitis, thought to be due to mirtazapine, has been reported [29].Read more

Emanuel Mendel's 1881 “Die Manie – Eine Monographie” (Mania – A Monograph)

Kenneth S Kendler, Astrid Klee, in Journal of Affective Disorders Reports, 2023

5 Chapter 3: Special symptomatology

In this chapter, Mendel digs deeper into the clinical phenomenology of mania, first reviewing the “Anomalies of the Psychic Functions,” divided into perception, feelings and thinking.

5.1 Anomalies of perception

Mendel begins by noting that hallucinations are more common in mania than typically recognized with the exception of hypomania, where they are rarely seen. Visual hallucinations are frequent and often of a “pleasant content.” They can be both simple, like “lights,” or complex such as visitations from deceased relatives.

Auditory hallucinations are less common, being especially prominent in hallucinatory mania. Sometimes they direct the patient for example “to tear off their clothes, strip naked.” (Manie, 1881) P. 102. Mendel notes that hallucinations of smell, taste and touch are rare in mania.

5.2 Anomalies of feelings

Mendel begins this section describing changes in Cenesthesia which he defines as “the sum of the feelings that arise from the sensations of one's own body (Manie, 1881). P. 103” Interestingly, he notes that in the early stages of mania, not only do the prior depressive symptoms disappear, but so do somatic symptoms of illnesses:

… the asthmatic no longer feels shortness of breath… the feeling of constriction of the thorax in tuberculosis, the feeling of being full in the stomach region in patients with stomach or liver disease, disappears. 2p. 104

The manic patient, he adds, is frequently insensitive to “hunger and thirst, cold and hot. P. 1042“ Mendel wonders if this results from an “anesthesia of the supposed centers for those feelings p. 1052” or arises from their preoccupation, their mind being so full of “ever-changing ideas. 2P. 105”

He next examines changes in what he terms “Intellectual Feelings” which, following Wundt, he defines as “emotions which accompany the perceptive connections of ideas, which include aesthetic, moral, religious feelings p. 105. 2” It is by a failure of these typical “intellectual feelings” that Mendel explains the apparent collapse of “psychic inhibitions” in mania so that

… momentary thoughts, momentary strivings are translated into actions without finding a correction or an inhibition through those feelings of decency, custom, morality which, under normal circumstances, are able to suppress … 2p. 105

The general lack of constraints, through which impulses quickly manifest themselves in mania, give the manic his “pathologically increased … general feeling of pleasure” p. 105. He goes into details about the frequent increase in sexual behaviors as well as the impact of the “Impulse to Enjoy Spirits.” 2p. 108. He notes that increased use of tobacco in all its forms is also common. He evaluates whether periodic dipsomania should be considered a form of mania and concludes it should not.

Next, he reviews the marked tendency for manic patients to “collect and steal 2p. 116.” He notes that in the stealing of manic patients, the consciousness of doing something wrong is missing, in the flight of ideas those which would prohibit the patient from carrying out the criminal act do not develop with such strength that they could prevent the deed. (Manie, 1881) P. 116

5.3 Anomalies of thinking

In this section, Mendel first examines changes in the activity of thoughts in mania and then examines their content – especially delusions. His first topic is the “Pathological Increase of Thought Activity” p. 117. He explains

The number of ideas that come to mind in a certain period of time is increased in mania, and their course is accelerated. The obstacles that oppose the connection of ideas with one another in the normal brain, the effort that we feel when “thinking” has disappeared: “The flight of ideas had no resistance,” said a healed manic patient when describing his morbid exalted state. 2P. 117

Mendel cautions against concluding that because of this, the manic patient has become more intelligent and creative. He summarizes his skepticism on this point succinctly: “What the mind gains in speed it loses in depth. 2P. 117” He also points out the repetitiveness of much of manic ideation. As the thought acceleration increases, the speech often becomes “only connected externally, perhaps only through the same initial letters or a similar sound in the pronunciation 2p. 118-9.” Eventually, “confusion sets in.” Mendel notes that the writing of manic patients closely resembles their speaking.

Toward the end of manic episodes, Mendel comments that “one often sees signs that point to a reduction in mental strength as the transition from the frenzied state to recovery. 2P. 120.” But these states, perhaps reflecting “a temporary state of exhaustion of the brain and its psychic capacity (Manie, 1881) p. 120“ rarely last in what he considers typical episodes of mania, typically disappearing in a few weeks or months.

Examining changing in the content of thoughts, Mendel immediately turns to what he terms “expansive delusions,” noting that early in the course of a manic episode, the abnormal beliefs typically “represents only a certain overestimation of one's physical and mental abilities 2p. 121.” But such beliefs “…can still move within the limits of the possible, and can be presented with such skill that those who are a bit further removed do not doubt their feasibility. 2P. 121”

… the disease continues, further developed ideas of grandeur are expressed. “All problems are now clear and tangible before my eyes”, “I can do anything I want”, “I am the general of X”, said a simple citizen woman. “I am the angel of peace”, “God has chosen me to make the world happy,” cried a young girl. “I imagined I was immortal, I would never die,” “I am the mistress of the crown prince.” 2P. 121.

Importantly, Mendel comments that “… in general, but not without exception, the grandiose ideas of the manic patients are still within certain limits, in contrast to those found in the paretic cases. 2P. 122.” Mendel contrasts the more understandable grandiose delusions of mania with the fantastical and often bizarre grandiose delusions typical of General Paresis of the Insane.

Mendel then comments that the second most frequent delusional theme in mania is persecutory delusions, which often arise when attempts are made by authorities or relatives to put restrictions on their behavior. In more severe cases

…they see in the guards of the institution “secret policemen who are watching them”, they defend themselves against all kinds of reproaches which have not been made towards them at all. With the deprivation of their personal freedom, they associate the idea that one will get rid of them, secretly want to poison them, that their wives wanted to use the time of their internment for infidelity, etc. (Manie, 1881) p. 123.

After briefly noting an additional anomaly of thinking in mania – hypermnesia – the substantial increase in the quality of recall, he notes that although self-awareness is often quite limited in mania, it is not always absent. Early in an episode …

…there is not infrequently a certain awareness of the pathological process taking place in the brain: “I live only in the thoughts of my ideal” (a girl). “I no longer understand myself, I make acquaintances with French, English, Italians, speak French like water and run away again the next moment. I'm starting to think I'm really crazy…. I'm not healthy, I'm in a kind of intoxication,” a manic patient wrote home of the journey he made at the onset of the illness. 2p. 124

He notes that the experiences of manic patient are

… described by a large number of convalescents as “intoxication”. “The attacks are not so terrible, I find myself in them as if in a kind of intoxication. I have to sing and dance then, but later come the regrets,” said a periodic manic patient. 2P. 125

A severely ill patient recounted after recovery “Just as little as one can give oneself an exact account of everything after a wild dream, so it is here. 2P. 125”

Mendel then turns to a brief description of the mood changes in mania which are worth quoting in full:

The manic patient's mood results from their feelings and ideas, and from the greater or lesser obstacles that oppose them externally. People have spoken of a happy mania, of an angry mania … Such divisions seem quite useless, since the pictures are very changeable. The joyful, cheerful manic patient who is roaming about freely often becomes angry, furious when he is locked up, and the one who has just been angry becomes cheerful when he is granted some trifle to make him happy, or when momentary inhibitions recede after new ideas of overestimation and grandiosity arise. Manic patients often alternate between crying and laughing from one minute to the next. The basic mood of the manic patients is, nevertheless, mostly cheerful, in accordance with the whole psychic state, but no symptom seems less suitable to be emphasized as characteristic of mania than the mood with its manifold and sudden changes. 2Pp. 125-6.

As will be clearer below, Mendel does not believe that the mood changes in mania reflect the fundamental nature of the disorder from which other symptoms and signs emerge.

In a brief section on “anomalies of action” in mania, Mendel describes both the great spending of money early in the onset of a typical episode and the more destructive or regressed behaviors in frenzied states. These sections conclude with a review of the forensic issues associated with mania which we will not discuss here.

5.4 Anomalies of somatic functioning

Mendel begins describing sensory changes – noting that early in a manic episode, both hyperosmia and hyperacusis are common. He gives examples:

One woman (a flower lover) e.g. at the beginning of her illness could not tolerate any fragrant smelling flower in her room…“Don't speak so loudly,” “Your voice is ringing in my ears,” I have heard patients say at the beginning of the manic exaltation. 2P. 130-1.

We do not comment on the next section documenting potential changes in other organ functions in mania.Read more

Music, Neurology, and Neuroscience: Historical Connections and Perspectives

Reinhard Steinberg, in Progress in Brain Research, 2015

2.2 Psychiatric–Neurologic Knowledge in 1850/1860

What clinical picture were Robert Schumann's physician's thinking of, what was diagnosed in psychiatry at that time, what were the therapeutic methods and objectives?

2.2.1 Joseph Guislain (1852) and Heinrich Laehr (1854)

In the autopsy report, Richarz cites the textbook by Guislain from 1852, published in a German translation by Laehr in 1854. A long chapter is dedicated to “General paralysis” (p. 166). There would be convulsions similar to epilepsy, in particular “disorders in articulation and fixed gaze.” Temporary “excessive headaches” are reported. The clinical picture can start also with mutism; “palsies” occurred (p. 167). There was a permanent “…gradual weakening of the perception, memory, and all mental abilities.” Transient disorders were “…mood swings, flaring up, crises, attacks, which occur in more or less short intervals and which, after they have started with stupor, then cause muscular weakness, paralysis, and finally convulsions and a soporific state.” The disturbances of speech are stressed, and pupil differences are mentioned (p. 168): “…Sometimes the one pupil is more dilated than the other. This symptom has been described by Baillarger as a new symptom of general paralysis; at the same time it is not a criterion of the same, because it is just as much a part of mania…”

The psychopathology names melancholic or manic episodes. Megalomanic states are often seen. Speech is lost almost completely. Skin changes, serous blisters can form on the legs/the thighs (p. 169). Angry outbursts accompany the dementia development, which ends as “paralytic dementia” with the loss of all mental powers and affect reading, writing, and talking but have also many other qualities (p. 170). The symptoms of muscle weakness, intellectual weakness, and delirium are the most important (p. 171). More recently, “general paralysis” has been called also “progressive paralysis” (Baillarger) (p. 172).

Although the diagnosis is difficult to make at first, there are clear differences from “true dementia without general paralysis” (p. 173) and apoplectic paralysis (p. 174), which are accompanied by hemi- or paraplegia. Guislain/Laehr delimits anatomically the “softening of the brain,” with the liquefaction of the cerebral texture. In dissection findings, the cortical substance is softened, but a large difference can still be seen to apoplexy. Guislain/Laehr illustrates their concept in several microscopic anatomical drawings; in particular drawings 7 and 8 in table II should make clear the structure of paralytic cortical tissue.

2.2.2 Wilhelm Griesinger (1845, 1861)

Griesingers textbook, first published in 1845 and again in 1861 as a “second, reworked and much augmented edition,” reflects the medicine of the time. In the “Forth Section: About some important complications of insanity,” Griesinger describes “…the so-called general (incomplete) paralysis, because of its frequency of occurrence, the peculiarities of its course, and its extremely sad prognosis…” (p. 400). He emphasizes symptoms for differential diagnosis that clearly separate it from paralyses after apoplexy, tumors, or “senile idiocy,” i.e., “senile dementia” in contemporary usage. “Paralytic idiocy (folie paralytique)” is a separate form (p. 401) that first appears as mental symptoms, then after a few months also as somatic symptoms. Speaking, tongue motor function, is affected very early on. “…In addition to the tongue, also the lips are usually moved erratically; formation of the labial sounds is made particularly difficult…” (p. 403). “…This first symptom, decreased speech fluency, which soon becomes stuttering, is exceptionally important; as soon as it is noticed in someone with mental illness, he is almost with certainty to be considered lost…” Other movements that also require fine motor precision, e.g., “writing, sewing, piano playing, etc.,” are impaired (p. 402). In the final stage, speech changes “into confused tones that run together obscurely” (p. 402). The pupils are at first evenly dilated, later unevenly; one almost never sees strabismus (p. 403).

“…smell and taste diminish only after the mood has been affected for a longer time, the patient can no longer distinguish e.g., water and wine from each other – there is no pain, only perhaps at the very start occasional headaches with the feeling of heaviness and dullness of the head and some dizziness….” Sensitivity is not infrequently disturbed; there is anesthesia and hyperesthesia, the latter at even the lightest touches, which may possibly result in reflex movements and convulsions. “…Sudden attacks of unconsciousness, often with wide-spread epilepsy-like convulsions, occur not infrequently in these patients in the guise of severe head congestion, and…occasionally recur, … but [the patient] usually soon recovers again from them…” (p. 404).

The illness begins often with a “…Melancholic stage… that soon has a simple depressive character, soon a markedly pronounced, hypochondriac one.” “Muscle disorders” are rare at the beginning, but very different types of course exist, “the weakening in character and whole being of the patient at the start develops differently…” Eventually “general agitated mental states,” mostly also with motor disturbances, followed; aroused states resulted often in megalomania, mostly euphoric with excesses (p. 405). The named symptoms include “Incoherence (particularly when writing),” the patients would have “…something easily moved, mournful in their being” (p. 406).

Sometimes, however, the illness would proceed without megalomania. In some cases, one would find also “…a noticeable dryness of the skin with strong peeling of the epidermis… and reduced sensitivity of the skin…” In the end, marasmus, chronic intestinal catarrh, and eventually pneumonia would be seen (p. 407).

According to Guislain/Laehr, the cause was excesses “in Bacchus or in Venere.” Griesinger talks of “…Excesses in spirituous drinks and in Venere, … perhaps strong cigars and strong coffee sometimes also play a certain part; but there are cases in which the illness breaks out after the most regular of lives, without one of these causes, namely also without any previous syphilis, which recently came to the fore as a possible etiology (W. Jessen)…” (p. 408).

The frequency is almost the same everywhere, almost one quarter of the men in psychiatric institutions are affected. None of the other statistical figures explain the astonishing decrease in the number of people with paralysis in Ghent, which Guislain cites (p. 409).

The illness lasts some months to 3 years, sometimes up to 10 years. The “progressive character” is always obvious; remissions, also without delusions, are fairly common, sometimes for up to half a year, then the illness takes its course again with “a congestive seizure” (p. 410).

Anatomically, alterations of the tissue can be seen, but never bleeding, which distinguishes it from apoplexy. Blood effusions can be seen in the arachnoid, sometimes cysts or pseudomembranes. The diagnosis is mostly not difficult. The differentiation from paralysis with other causes is easy (p. 410). One does not always see atrophy, sometimes meningitis is more in the foreground, sometimes sclerosis, mainly in connective tissue (p. 444). Motor disorders are important for the prognosis and diagnosis, which characterize the progressive paralysis (p. 445). It was treated in asylums by isolation and diet, for calming (p. 446).Read more
