The War for Muslim Minds: Islam and the West Paperback – April 30, 2006

by Gilles Kepel (Author)

4.1 4.1 out of 5 stars 17 ratings

See all formats and editions

The events of September 11, 2001, forever changed the world as we knew it. In their wake, the quest for international order has prompted a reshuffling of global aims and priorities. In a fresh approach, Gilles Kepel focuses on the Middle East as a nexus of international disorder and decodes the complex language of war, propaganda, and terrorism that holds the region in its thrall. The breakdown of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process in 2000 was the first turn in a downward spiral of violence and retribution. Meanwhile, a neo-conservative revolution in Washington unsettled U.S. Mideast policy, which traditionally rested on the twin pillars of Israeli security and access to Gulf oil. In Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan, a transformation of the radical Islamist doctrine of Bin Laden and Zawahiri relocated the arena of terrorist action from Muslim lands to the West; Islamist radicals proclaimed jihad against their enemies worldwide. Kepel examines the impact of global terrorism and the ensuing military operations to stem its tide. He questions the United States' ability to address the Middle East challenge with Cold War rhetoric, while revealing the fault lines in terrorist ideology and tactics. Finally, he proposes the way out of the Middle East quagmire that triangulates the interests of Islamists, the West, and the Arab and Muslim ruling elites. Kepel delineates the conditions for the acceptance of Israel, for the democratization of Islamist and Arab societies, and for winning the minds and hearts of Muslims in the West.

“Mr. Kepel's book is less about ideology and culture and more about war and geopolitics; with a full account of the Madrid bombings last spring, and the upsurge of fighting in Iraq at around the same time, it is remarkably up to date. The book includes a succinct anatomy of America's neoconservative camp, along with that camp's bitterest enemies in the world of ultra-militant Islam. It shows how both these parties were intensely frustrated by the Oslo peace process, and relieved by its collapse...Mr. Kepel is unsparing in the way he contrasts Iraq's present situation with the post-Saddam vision once promised by the neoconservatives...He also insists that ultra-militant Islam has not won either...It is possible, [he] suggests, that European Islam might evolve in new ways that could co-exist with modernity, asserting its distinctiveness without pretending, dishonestly, to live in another century...In the development of such an understanding, [The War for Muslim Minds] can make a large and highly intelligent contribution.”―The Economist “The War for Muslim Minds is less sanguine [than Kepel's previous book]. In a wide-ranging survey of events over the past few years, Mr. Kepel makes the case that the West is losing exactly such a war. Islamism may be in decline but its replacement is hardly better: a less focused but equally bitter rejection of the West. This rejection has come about, he argues partly because of Islam's own misguided sense of modernity but partly, too, because of U.S. policies that were designed to do the opposite--to provide an alternative to antimarket, antidemocratic ideologies.”―Ian Johnson, Wall Street Journal “A masterpiece of political explication. Kepel is especially good on the symmetries between the Islamic fundamentalists and their Western equivalents, the neoconservatives.”―Daniel Lazare, The Nation “Reading Gilles Kepel's new book, The War for Muslim Minds, challenges one's sense of scale. Crucial, irreversible steps such as George W. Bush's early decision not to pursue the Palestinian-Israeli peace process and the neoconservatives' justification for the Iraq war, take on new meaning when seen in context of the enormous geopolitical scope of Islam today...Easy to read (no footnotes but a good bibliography for each chapter), this persuasive book challenges the American perspective on the war on terror and, more important, reveals the rich complexity of contemporary Islam.”―Thomas D'Evelyn, Christian Science Monitor “Gilles Kepel [has] proved to be among the most insightful Western observers of Muslim societies in the modern world.”―Pankaj Mishra, Times Literary Supplement “Kepel masterfully traces the different threads of the mujahideen, focusing on Ayman al-Zwahiri, who emerged as the mastermind of Al-Qa'ida...Kepel's strength lies in providing an intricate analysis of the major players, ideologies and movements in such disparate cultures as the U.S. and Middle East.”―Sheema Khan, Montreal Gazette “Kepel's central thesis can be summed up simply: the United States is losing the war, and badly. Instead of encouraging resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the Bush administration has played directly into Al Qaeda's hands by invading Iraq. It failed to recognize that the war would further inflame the Muslim world, convincing more Muslims than ever before that the United States was their enemy. Now, Kepel says, Europe will inherit the whirlwind, in the form of growing Islamic extremism and terrorist acts like the Madrid bombings.”―Noah Feldman, New York Times Book Review “The War for Muslim Minds is...clearly the product of deep learning; Kepel knows Islamism well enough to see distinctions where most commentators see only uniformity. His discussions of the competing strains in Saudi Islamist thought and the influence of Internet imams on Muslims in France are worth the book's price alone...The problem, he suggests, is that...the Bush administration's war on terror--expressed in disastrous policies toward both the Palestinians and Iraq--is gaining for al-Qaeda an appeal it could never win on its own. In contrast to President Bush, who has responded to 9/11 with an audacious effort to redirect the course of Muslim history, Kepel implicitly calls for something far more modest: prudent management of a threat that--if we let it--can be beaten from within. The war for Muslim minds, Kepel suggests, will be won in Riyadh, Cairo, and the suburbs of Paris. In Washington it can't be won--only lost...He sees a vital role for the young Muslims of Europe, who, if granted economic opportunity by their host societies, could create a model of tolerant, prosperous Islam that reverberates across the globe...If realism is returning to fashion, Gilles Kepel may finally have the intellectual wind at his back.”―Peter Beinart, The Atlantic “Reading Gilles Kepel's important book, it is easy to see why al-Qaida should be so enthusiastic about Bush...[He] has fulfilled Bin Laden's every hope. Through the invasion of secular Ba'athist Iraq, the abuses in Abu Ghraib, the mass-murders in Faluja, America, with Britain's obedient assistance, has turned Iraq into a jihadist playground while alienating all moderate Muslim opinion. We may have failed to capture Bin Laden, but we have succeeded in liberating the extremists, radicalising the unaffiliated and making life more difficult than ever for our natural allies: ordinary, decent, moderate Muslims. Kepel is the best possible guide through the frightening labyrinth of militant Islam. A fluent Arabic speaker who has spent many years in the Middle East, he has been writing about the subject for two decades, and has personally interviewed most of the principal players. Kepel writes with forensic clarity and an unrivalled grasp of detail; yet his deep knowledge of the subject over a long period allows him to present the wider picture. This concise, engaging and authoritative book should be required reading for anyone wishing to understand what is happening in the Islamic world and the terrifyingly counter-productive nature of our response to it...The battle is now on for the hearts and minds of ordinary Muslims--a battle the U.S. is catastrophically losing.”―William Dalrymple, The Guardian “Al-Qa'ida has been so thoroughly anatomised that one wonders if there's much more to say. As Kepel's book proves, there certainly is...Kepel's account of neo-conservativism is as interesting as his analysis of al-Qa'ida...His analysis of how Egyptian and Saudi strains of radical Islam fused to create a virulent new cocktail is detailed and persuasive, as is his X-ray view of the Saudi state.”―Michael Church, The Independent “The book deals in concise and convincing ways with Saudi Arabia's Muslim Brotherhood and the deadly influence of Wahhabi Islam. This is one of the best short analyses of that country's past and future available. And the chapter on the war in Iraq allows Kepel to look, unsparingly and in depth, at the global political fallout of the issues he has described in the preceding pages. Indeed, as of now, The War for Muslim Minds can be regarded as a standard, perhaps even definitive, layman's guide to the current state of Islamism, and a work that deserves to be read widely.”―Turi Munthe, Times Higher Education Supplement “[An] excellent book...by a brilliant academic turned popularizer...As well as his valuable discussion of al-Qaeda, Kepel has some useful things to say about the pedigree of Neoconservatism in the United States and about developments in Saudi Arabia, in particular the effects of the influx of Islamists flying from persecution in secular Middle Eastern states during the 1950s and '60s.”―M. E. Yapp, Times Literary Supplement “[The War for Muslim Minds] displays a remarkable mastery of detail as it ranges across the Middle East and illuminates debates within Islam and the American right.”―John Dugdale, The Guardian “The author's...thorough scholarship in the field of Islamic studies is impressive. He understands the subtle distinctions between sects of the religion and how those distinctions have fueled the rise of radical, terrorism-focused Islam responsible for the September 11th attacks. What is striking is Kepel's uncovering of how the two cornerstones of US policy in the region over the last half century--the security of Israel and the sustained friendship with Sunni petro-monarchies--inarguably led to the destruction of the World Trade Center towers on 9/11, and how those two mainstays also fueled Bush #2's determination to invade Iraq.”―Avi Kramer, Kliatt “The best primer available for the general reader on the history and implications of the 11 September attacks and the War on Terror.”―Leila Hudson, Historian

Gilles Kepel is Professor and Chair of Middle East Studies at the Institute of Political Studies in Paris.

5.0 out of 5 stars Thorough and fascinating. Reviewed in the United States on March 23, 2014

Whether you are new to learning about the Muslim world or well-read in the subject, this book is a very thorough, illuminating account of recent history in the region. I felt that I came away from this book much more knowledgable of the current situation than I was before I started. I'd highly recommend this to everyone, since it is a very important topic worth understanding.

5.0 out of 5 stars A Required Text Reviewed in the United States on October 8, 2009

This should be required reading -- and debating -- material for the post-Sept 11th Western World. This is why there is an al-Jazeera And why many light-skinned Scots and English broadcasters have gone to work for ***them***.

5.0 out of 5 stars Gilles Kepel is one to keep reading Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2017

This is my first look at one of Gilles Kepel's books. I was intrigued by a New York Times article about him - The Professor and the Jihadi and checked this book out from the library. The English translation is from 2004 so this is already old news by now in 2017. He has written lots more and the reading of this book has convinced me he is one more writer well worth reading to get a sense of his grasp of the situation. I am impressed by his biography (and hope he stays safe). Since I teach philosophy my interest is in helping individuals - of all backgrounds - to move to a modern frame of mind. It is a challenge for everyone as our contemporary academic point of view is complex and to fully follow it takes a full time commitment. That means most won't have the time. I do have students who are Muslim and have discovered quite a range of beliefs among them. An issue for some is English as a second language. I may never really get a sense of what some are thinking. Granted, this is more a history of recent events between Orientalism and the West and among those who have immigrated to France for the most part, and not a focus on specific individuals as they process ideas and evolve towards a modern mind set - which is what I hoped to find. But I thought the interaction and analysis of Tariq Ramadan by Gilles Kepel to be very useful as I have read much more of Ramadan's books and have noted an interesting about face as he matured and has become more European and less Islamic. There are lots of others of interest. Peter Sloterdijk on the concept of Rage seems associated. Also my favorite book on Islam is by Hans Kung.

2.0 out of 5 stars Triumph of Political Correctness over Facts Reviewed in the United States on August 24, 2005

This book was a major disappointment after the author's brilliant work JIHAD. Jihad was published just as the US was destroying the Taliban, and I had hoped that this work would bring us up to date with the invasion of Iraq. I immediately noticed that Kepel did not bother to correct his characterization of US tactics in Afghanistan as "carpet-bombing", which it wasn't. Then he referred to photos of American "sexual abuse and torture" of Iraqi prisoners (which was more like hazing) while calling videos of the beheading of a screaming American youth as "mistreatment." Events have shown Kepel's earlier theory that Islamic fundamentalism is falling apart is quite correct, losing out to a rising tide of democracy in Lebanon, Iraq, Egypt, and even Saudi Arabia, but he sort of goes off the rails to talk about the Islamic diaspora in Europe and elsewhere as the hope for the future. I guess he's afraid of not getting invited to the right cocktail parties in Paris if he endorsed anything to do with American policy.

5.0 out of 5 stars Indispenable Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2004

Kepel's new book is indispensable for anyone who wants to get a comprehensive, thorough, and balanced understanding of the threat posed by Islamic radicals today and of the logic/illogic behind the US response to that threat. Kepel's book focuses on three basic subjects. First, he provides a precis of the fuller description of Islamic radicalism that he gave in his earlier (excellent) book, Jihad. Second, he traces the neoconservative lineage of President Bush's approach to meeting the Islamic threat-- unsucessfully, so far. Notably, Kepel says almost nothing about Europe's response/attitude, perhaps because Europe seems to be waiting on the sidelines of history to see who will win, the US or the radicals. Finally, Kepel expresses hope that the Muslims who live in infidel Europe will prove to be a source of reconciliation and progress in the Muslim world at large, exporters of western liberalism as it were. With regard to this last point I can only say, "from his mouth to God's ear," although I personally see no reason for even guarded optimism. This is the best book on the subject by far.

5.0 out of 5 stars Concise and Authoritative Reviewed in the United Kingdom on April 2, 2008

Islamic Fundamentalism and its link to terrorism have become the defining issues of our time. Many in the West see Islamist-inspired terrorism as thoughtless, irrational or defying explanation. How else can one explain ghastly acts of suicide bombings, beheadings and mass murder all performed in the name of Islam? Gilles Kepels' excellent book, The War for Muslim minds provides some answers in understanding the root cause of Islamist terrorism and how Islam, being one of the great world religions, defies the glib simplifications that the Western media append to it. What I like about the book Gilles Kepel is a keen observer of the Muslim and Arab world. He provides just enough detail to the reader to allow him/her perceive the big picture. He begins this book with the terrible events of September 11, 2001. The terrorist attacks on the twin towers seemed to to be a watershed moment in world history. For a brief moment the "civilized" world was united in condemnation of the attacks. Like a good detective, Kepel dispassionately traces the reasons for attacks, eschews making any value judgments and follows the evidence wherever it leads. At the end of the first chapter the putative cause for the attacks, declared by the culprits in that attack, Al-Qaeda, is that bugbear of US foreign policy, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the breakdown of the Oslo Peace process. The failure of the Peace Process and the subsequent outbreak of the second intifada was the excuse given by Mr Bin Laden to attack the World Trade Centre. For Bin Laden, according to Kepel, September 11 did not change the world; it was but one milestone in his strike against the "Far Enemy". The most informative chapter in the book was Chapter 2 on the Western "equivalent" of Islamic Fundamentalists, the Neoconservatives. Again, Mr Kepels analyses the rise of neo-conservative doctrine and its impact on American foreign policy with forensic clarity. He clearly demonstrates that the Neo-con's "project to restore international order along ideological lines did not originate in September 11." The author traces the movement from its founders in the 1960's, Irving Kristol and Leo Strauss to its modern-day proponents, Paul Wolfowitz, Dick Cheney and Richard Perle. The main thrust of the Neo-con vision in the Middle East was: - To assure the security of the state of Israel - Eliminating Saddam Hussein and installing a pro-Western government in Iraq, thereby putting pressure on its Saudi allies for reform - Oversee the emergence of a "New Middle East" much like the former Communist Eastern Europe under the US' benign influence With the election of George Bush, the tragic events of September 11 gave the Neo-cons the opportunity to push their agenda. In hindsight this vision, better suited to the Cold War, was naïve. The events of the 2003 Iraq war further demonstrated that the implementation of the vision was grossly inept. The war only seemed to add fuel to the fire of Muslim anger against the US. Again, Kepels refrains from making value judgments on the Iraq War. Instead he demonstrates that the US invasion of Iraq must be seen against this larger backdrop of the Neo-con agenda and not just as a grab for oil or the now discredited belief in the existence of weapons of mass destruction. The book concludes on a cautiously optimistic note for the future of Islam. That future rests on Westerners of Muslim descent. The author paints a very complex picture of Islam in Europe today; from upwardly mobile British South East Asian Muslims who have no connection to the Middle Eastern "homeland" to socially-excluded French citizens of North African descent. Like in any vibrant Middle Eastern bazaar, European Muslims are constantly barraged with every form of Islam; from the pacifist Sufism to militant jihadism. Gilles Kepel concludes that how this group of Muslims who are, brought up in secular modern states, slowly taking positions of influence within Western Europe, "freed from the straitjacket of authoritarianism and corruption" and "from the rage of rebellion that endorses jihad" reacts to future changes will define the face of Islam. As a Nigerian, who knows all too well the extreme violence and anti-intellectualism that Fundamentalism Islam has engendered in my native land, it is a hope that I sincerely share. What I did not like In the chapter, the Battle for Europe, I got lost in all the acronyms used to describe the various Islamic movements in Europe-UOIF, CRCM etc. At some point I could not remember what each group stood for, especially as the groups began to shift alliances. I also found the book to me too short (327 pages) to cover such an important topic. However, Mr Kepel makes up for it by including an extensive biography. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to dig deeper than the numbing sound bites and media images of Islam. Gilles Kepel shows that there is logic, indeed a trajectory to Islamic Fundamentalism and that the West's response to it so far has been half-hearted, self-serving and unhelpful. The book is a fascinating, detailed and authoritative book. It deserves 5 stars.
