A place to respectfully discuss and debate religion

Islam is against intellectualism, critical thinking, and curiosity, and as a result of this, we see Muslim countries lag behind in science and technology.

The first thing we should define here is what intellectualism means in the context of the Quran and Islam, and what intellectualism means when we are discussing epistemology.

From a secular view, intellectualism means the devotion to pursuits in search of knowledge[1], where knowledge means justified true belief[2].

The Quran also does use a few different words that refer to reason and knowledge.

For example, the Quran does advocate for the use of reason:

Indeed, the worst of living creatures in the sight of Allah are the deaf and dumb who do not use reason

Here Tafsir Mokhtasar defines this as: “The worst of creatures on the face of the earth in the sight of Allah are those who are deaf to the truth, not listening to it and accepting it; and dumb, not acknowledging the truth or calling to it, because they do not understand what Allah instructs or forbids.”. Here the truth is meant to mean the truth of Islam. So the religion of Islam itself, not truth in the epistemological sense.

The function of reason in the Quran is to validate the Quran, not to question it. It is not right for a Muslim to interrogate the principles of theology, instead one should submit to the will of God through revelation.

So from an Islamic perspective, the Quran is completely pro-intellectualism. However, we have to be careful not to use the persuasive definition [3] fallacy, because when I say Islam is against intellectualism, I am referring to the secular definition, not the Islamic definition.

From now on when I say intellectualism, I will be using intellectualism to mean the pursuit of knowledge through justified true belief.

Quran and Skepticism

Most of us would agree that questioning is good. By questioning, we may be able to get answers to our questions, and through intellectual thinking, expand our knowledge.

When it comes to asking too many questions, or trying to use your reason in order to come to a conclusion about Islam, you are generally discouraged.

Here the Quran explicitly discourages asking questions, and even admits that people have become disbelievers by asking too many questions:

O you who have believed, do not ask about things which, if they are shown to you, will distress you. But if you ask about them while the Qur’ān is being revealed, they will be shown to you. Allah has pardoned it [i.e., that which is past]; and Allah is Forgiving and Forbearing. A people asked such [questions] before you; then they became thereby disbelievers.

This is what the Quran says about trying to find the meaning of the Quran:

And when you see the ones who wade (Or: plunge; become absorbed in) into Our signs, then veer away from them until they wade (Or: plunge; become absorbed in) into (some) other discourse; and in case Ash-Shaytan (The all-vicious, i.e., the Devil) ever definitely makes you forget, then do not sit, after the Reminding, with the unjust people.

This is because it might shake your faith if others start talking in vain about your book.

Here, the quran puts roadblocks on asking questions. You have to pay money to charity before asking Muhammand questions:

O you who have believed, when you [wish to] privately consult the Messenger, present before your consultation a charity. That is better for you and purer. But if you find not [the means] - then indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.

The exegesis according to Ibn Kathir is as follows: “The Muslims kept asking Allah's Messenger questions until it became difficult on him. Allah wanted to lighten the burden from His Prophet, upon him be peace. So when He said this, many Muslims were afraid to pay this charity and stopped asking.”. How convenient!

Here are some other verses telling you to not question:

...those [hypocrites] with sickness in their hearts and the disbelievers will argue, “What does Allah mean by such a number?” In this way Allah leaves whoever He wills to stray and guides whoever He wills. And none knows the forces of your Lord except He. And this [description of Hell] is only a reminder to humanity.

And they ask you, [O Muḥammad], about the soul. Say, "The soul is of the affair [i.e., concern] of my Lord. And you [i.e., mankind] have not been given of knowledge except a little."

This one tells you what you must do, if you find yourself in doubt:

So when you recite the Qur’ān, [first] seek refuge in Allah from Satan, the expelled [from His mercy]. … And when We substitute a verse in place of a verse - and Allah is most knowing of what He sends down - they say, "You, [O Muḥammad], are but an inventor [of lies]." But most of them do not know.

The Quran tends to replace it’s verses. When you read the Quran you might find issues with it, therefore you should not think about it. This concept (Naskh) has and still does create a lot of doubt in Muslims everywhere. As we see Allah doesn’t give a reason for this, rather He tells you these questions are from Satan so seek refuge in Allah. The Intellectually honest advice, would be to explore those doubts and question why that would happen, not to run away from them.

What do I do when I have questions?

Here are a few hadith regarding this subject:

There is a lot of different ways the following hadith is narrated, here are some of them:

The Satan comes to everyone. of you and says: Who created this and that? till he questions: Who created your Lord? When he comes to that, one should seek refuge in Allah and keep away (from such idle thoughts).

People will continue to ask one another(questions) till this is pronounced: Allah created all things, but who created Allah ? Whoever comes across anything of that, he should say: I believe in Allah.

~ Sunan Abi Dawud 4721

So from this we get the idea that asking questions regarding Allah and the nature of Allah is discouraged.

The Holy Prophet (ﷺ) forbade the discussion of thorny questions.

~ Sunan Abi Dawud 3656

Once again, the only reason why one would prohibit questions would be if they are afraid of what they may find out.

Is Sharia reasonable?

It is important to note that you can’t reason about issues relating to jurisprudence, for example:

If the religion were based on opinion, it would be more important to wipe the under part of the shoe than the upper but I have seen the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wiping over the upper part of his shoes.

~ Sunan Abi Dawud 162

Or as Al-Juwayni put it “No obligation flows from reason but from the Sharia”.

Should believers be gullible?

I’ll let the reader decide on the authenticity of the following hadith, but these hadiths and many more on the same subject, are used quite extensively in the Muslim world, they are used in sermons and they are part of the orthodoxy. I’ll just mention these and move on as I think the implications should be clear here.

The believer is guileless and generous while the corrupt is a swindler and miserly

~ Al-Adab Al-Mufrad 418

Apostle of God (ﷺ) said: majority of dwellers in Paradise are simpletons (al-buluh)

~ Musnad al-Bazzar; al-Qurtubi declared it sahih in his Tafsir under verses 26:83-89 and in his Tadhkira

Omar and his Stories

Let’s discuss Omar what he did to the scientific and historiographic books that were written:

When the Muslims conquered Persia and came upon an indescribably large number of books and scientific papers, Sa’d ibn Abi Waqqas wrote to Umar ibn al-Khattab, asking him for permission to take them and distribute them as booty among the Muslims. On that occasion Umar wrote him: “Throw them into the water. If what they contain is right guidance, God has given us better guidance. If it is error, God has protected us against it.” Thus the (Muslims) threw them into the water or into the fire, and the sciences of the Persians were lost and did not reach us

Omar is one of the few people who has been granted the keys to paradise, if this is the person that Muslims are trying to emulate, I don’t see how intellectualism and science can ever grow in the Muslim world.

It is no wonder why the Taliban ordered all books in Afghanistan destroyed except for the Quran. In fact throughout history (including the Islamic Golden age) we see too many instances of book burnings and inquisitions if the subject of study went against orthodox teachings [4].

It has been narrated that Omar has also stated:

Verily, we were a disgraceful people and Allah honored us with Islam. If we seek honor from anything besides that with which Allah honored us, Allah will disgrace us.

Omar was not a man who cared about anything other than the religion. Would this man have been interested in building libraries?

Let’s discuss the most tragi-comedic story in this discussion. This is what Omar did to a person asking what I would consider tame questions about the Quran:

Subaigh Al-Tamimi began asking Omar by saying: “Tell me about ‘al-dhariat al-dharwa’ [Quran 51:1]”. He said: “They are the winds, and if I had not heard it from the messenger, may God bless him and grant him peace, I would not have told you'', he said: “Tell me about ‘fal-hamelat veqra’ [Quran 51:2] ” He said: “They are the clouds, and if I had not heard it from the messenger, may God bless him and grant him peace, I would not have told you”, he said: “Tell me about the ‘fal-jariat yusra’ [Quran 51:3]” He said: “They are ships, and if I had not heard it from the messenger, may God bless him and grant him peace, I would not have told you” He said: “Tell me about ‘fal-muqassemat amra’ [Quran 51:4].” He said: “They are the angels, and if I had not heard it from the messenger, may God bless him and grant him peace, I would not have told you''.

So Omar said: “You ask too much”, then he ordered him to be whipped a hundred times and he placed him in a jail. When he recovered, he was whipped a hundred more times. They hit him until he couldn’t stand up. Then they left him until he recovered. Then they returned back to him, then they left until he recovered. Then they left him, then they came back to him. Then Subaigh said: “If you want to kill me, just kill me quickly, and if you want to let me be, then God is merciful.”

So he exiled him and sent him to Abu Musa al-Ashari and the people of Iraq. They did not allow Muslims to sit with him. If he came to a group of Muslims, they would leave him out. And this became severe for him. So Abu Musa wrote to Omar: “He has repented”, and Omar wrote: “Allow people to sit with him”. [5]

This also begs the question, why did Omar not just answer his question and move? Omar is one of the best people to ask these questions other than Muhammad himself. Surely he would have been one of the best best people to ask these questions.

Scholars and Their Thoughts on Skepticism

Ibn Hanbal though that religion was better off without theology. Since God has spoken to man, man no longer needs to think in any critical fashion [6]

Since the Quran did not authorize the use of kalam, there is no need for it. Ibn Hanbal stated, “Whoever involves themselves in any theological rhetoric is not counted amongst the Ahl us-Sunnah, even if by that he arrives at the Sunnah, until he abandons debating and surrenders to the texts. The use of rational arguments violated faith. Faith is not addressed to reason. Simply accept - bila kayfa (without saying how). As Ibn Hanbal declared, “Every discussion about a thing which the Prophet did not discuss is an error”

Ibn Khaldun says “We must refrain from studying these things [general classes] since such restraint falls under the duty of the muslim not to do what does not concern him. The problems of physics are of no importance for us in our religious affairs or our livelihoods. Therefore we must leave them alone”

Al-Farabi says “God’s law cannot be measured using human reason. They have been revealed by God, so secrets have been hidden in these that humans are incapable of understanding.”

Therefore, they all eschew reason in favor of understanding the Quran as it is. This has unfortunate results because it creates a completely erroneous epistemological framework. They take the word of the Quran as given, and do not question it. It is easy to see how believing in this framework will lead you nowhere in the pursuit of knowledge, since if your interpretation of the Quran (or the Quran itself) is wrong, then you can never reach the true conclusion from your studies.

When scholars find a verse that is unreasonable, objectionable, or could cause doubts in people, what they do is they interpret it in a way that makes sense. If you question them further asking how they know this is the correct interpretation, they might tell you that it is the correct interpretation because it validates the Quran. This is the foundation of their epistemology and it is completely flawed since it is using the circular reason fallacy.

In religion, you have to believe in the word and that is the truth. Whatever reason and logic should lead you to it, not the other way around. Muslim means surrender to the beliefs of Muhammad. This is the core of Islamic philosophy. We need to believe first and foremost. This has had the effect that believing without evidence is a virtue.

If the Quran is the obvious word of Allah, all knowledge can be captured by the Quran itself. This is how you shut down all critical thinking skills.

Probably one of the most critiqued theologians of the Islamic world is Al-Ghazali and his espousing of the idea of Occasionalism. Occasionalism means that every event has been created by God. Here is what Al-Ghazali himself says on the topic:

The connection between what is habitually believed to be a cause and what is habitually believed to be an effect is not necessary, according to us. For example, there is no causal connection between the quenching of thirst and drinking, satiety and eating, burning and contact with fire. Light and the appearance of the sun, death and decapitation, healing and the drinking of medicine, the purging of the bowels and the using of a purgative, and so on to [include] all [that is] observable among connected things in medicine, astronomy, arts, and crafts. Their connection is due to the prior decree of God, who created them side by side not to it being necessary in itself, incapable of separation. On the contrary, it is within [divine] power to create stiety without eating, to create death without decapitation, to continue life after decapitation, and so on to all connected things.... Our opponents claim that the agent of the burning is the fire exclusively; this is a natural not a voluntary agent, and cannot abstain from what is in its nature when it is brought into contact with a receptive substratum. This we deny, saying: The agent of the burning isGod, through His creating the black in the contton and the disconnection of its parts, and it is God who made the cotton burn and made it ashes either through the intermediation of angels or without intermediation. For fire is a dead body which has no action, and what is the proof that it is the agent? Indeed, the philosophers have no other proof that the observation of the occurrence of the burning, when there is contact with fire, but observation proves only simultaneity, not causation, and, in reality, there is no other cause, but God. [6]

These are all logic conclusions from the Quran. The Quran says “And the sun runs [on course] toward its stopping point. That is the determination of the Exalted in Might, the Knowing “ [Quran 36:38], “Allah holds back the heavens and the earth from leaving their existing state” [Quran 35:41], “No leaf ever falls but that He knows about it, and there is no grain in the dark layers of the earth, or anything fresh or dry that is not recorded in a manifest book.” [Quran 6:59]

This is also how you kill curiosity. By explaining that there are no causal connections, you remove the need to explore natural sciences, since everything can be explained away by God.

Al-Ghazali also went one step further. He declared all who were adherents of the old school of thought of Aristotelian philosophy, heretics, thereby condemning them to death. This is because apostacy is punishable by death in Islam, and those believing in unorthodox teachings would have been killed [7].

Scholars and Skepticism

In the current day if you go to a scholar and ask him a question on a matter of Islam, they often don’t answer the question itself, rather they will deflect and say that God is the only one who has this knowledge.

Anytime anyone asks about any matters related to theology, the answer is inevitably that “Only allah knows the answer”

Anytime anyone asks about something a Muslim has to do, the answer is “it is how Allah commands it, there must be a reason behind it that you may not know”.

The Early Modern Period and the Islamic Scholars’ War on Books and Schools

Let’s take a look at a couple of examples in modern history.

Printing Press in Ottoman Lands

Sultan Bayezid made printing press haram. Books that were printed were not allowed to be imported. Under penalty of death!

Printing Press, not established in Islamic lands. The first printing press in the Ottoman empire was David and Samuel ibn Namias, two Jewish brothers. The first printing press in Iran was introduced by an Armenian Christian Khachatur Kesaratsi. It wouldn’t be until the 19th century until books started to be printed in Islamic lands.

The first printed press was by a Hungarian convert by the name of Ibrahim Mutafirrika. Even then, no one was allowed to print in Arabic, or anything about Islam, and books must be approved (No physics and chemistry).

Printing was allowed for Jews and Christians, because that did not create a threat for the power of the Sultanate. It would seem that the elite scholars of Islam, were afraid of Muslims becoming more educated.

Why did the Muslim scholars disaprove? Because they were afraid of common people gaining knowledge on topics only they had access to. They wanted to create an exclusive scholarship.

Iran School System Reform

Let’s provide another example from the school system reform in Iran. In the late 19th and early 20th century, public schools were vehemently opposed by the clergy.

Haji-Mirza Hassan Roshdieh (The founder of the public school system at the time) says:

One of the clergymen, whose position is greater than what he is deserving of, could not contain himself. He said: "If these new schools are established, that is if all these madrasas were like these schools, after ten years you would not find one illiterate person. On that day, what will happen to the business of the theologians? It's clear. After the theologians have been stripped of their sanctity, Islam will lose its influence. When these schools in Europe had not reached such a position, there was hope for [Christianity]. As schools were expanded, religion lost its position. Christians became irreligious. The interest of the Muslims is that from every one hundred who studies in the madrasas, one or two become a mullah and literate, and the rest remain ignorant and obedient and subservient to the theologians." [9]

Here is a quote from one of the most prominent scholars of the period, Sheikh Fazlollah Noori:

I swear on the truth of Islam. Are these new schools not against Sharia? And does admission to these schools not coincide with the destruction of the religion of Islam? Does studying foreign language, chemistry and physics, not shake the faith of students? You have established these schools. You stated what you could in the media about the benefits of these schools. Now you are discussing constitutionalism, and republicanism. [9]

Current State of Freedom of Thought in Islam

Unfortunately, in the current day and age, we see the Muslim world lag behind in science and technology. Here are some statistics that show that demonstrate this:

9/1000 engineers in islamic countries with world average 40/1000 [10]

Very few Muslim nobel laureates [11]

Spain translates more books in a single year than the entire Arab world has in the past thousand years. [12]

I find it hypocritical that Muslims use scientific discoveries to show that the Quran allegedly knew about these discoveries all along, but have a contemptuous attitude towards science. They tend to wait until a scientific discovery is made, then somehow find ways to fit it into the Quran, because they believe that the Quran holds all knowledge.

At the end of the day, scientific findings have had conflicts with (at the very least the literal) word of God. The Quran says that only Allah knows what is in the mother’s womb [Quran 31:34] or no one can predict the rain [Quran 31:34] or the sun sets in a pool of boiling water [Quran 18:86] Geocentrism [Quran 36:40], Semen comes from the backbone and the ribs [Quran 86:7], dunking flies into drinks [Sahih al-Bukhari 3320], drinking camel urine [Jami at-Tirmidhi 2042] and more, it’s easy to see why science and Islam don’t go together.

For example, if Islam did advocate for the findings of science, we would be seeing greater acceptance for the theory of evolution in the Muslim world, but we see just as much opposition as we do in Christians.

Another issue seems to be that Muslim apologists tend to glorify Islam’s love of science, but this is more myth than reality.

If we weren't conquered by the British and French we would be much stronger. Our countries are now poor, corrupt, and shitty to live in because of former colonialism. Unlike the west, we didn't prosecute scientists and we're responsible for a lot of creations that are used in modern society. The industrial revolution made us lag behind and adding to that the multiple ideas of nationalism that were brought with the British conquest made us hate each other.

If we weren't conquered by the British and French we would be much stronger. Our countries are now poor, corrupt, and shitty to live in because of former colonialism.

Afghanistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Turkey haven't been colonized or conquered by Europeans.

South Korea, Singapore, Canada, Australia, New Zeeland, Finland, Norway and Ireland are all either former colonies or conquered and controlled by another country until quite recently.

Unlike the west, we didn't prosecute scientists

Islamic countries persecute scientist today, and they have been doing so for centuries.

and we're responsible for a lot of creations that are used in modern society.

"The west" is responsible for the vast majority of inventions used in modern society.

The industrial revolution made us lag behind and adding to that the multiple ideas of nationalism that were brought with the British conquest made us hate each other.

Muslim countries that were independent during the industrial revolution still lagged behind. Such as Turkey, Afghanistan and Iran.

Arab nationalism was a unifying force, if anything, as the levantine and north african arab nations trued to literally unite into one country under the banner of arab nationalism. Not to mention ideas aren't brought on by conquest, if you want an example just look at the nationalist movements in the Ottomans.

Muslim countries that weren't conquered/colonized aren't all that better off than the ones that were. UAE was a British protectorate, Saudi Arabia has never been subjugated by Europeans. They are scarcely different.

I'm not going to respond to your whole post because it's too long and rife with errors from the very beginning so I'm just going to hop on here. Also it'll increase the chances of it being seen. Your post was very long and followed an intellectual looking format but the substance is nothing but errors. Basically it's a very polished turd. It got up voted because redditors are ignorant Islamophobes.

Afghanistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Turkey haven't been colonized or conquered by Europeans.

That shows you're completely ignorant of history and have absolutely no understanding of it.

Afghanistan LOL 😂 that's literally all that needs to be said go look at the Soviets, UK, & US. Let me guess Ukraine is in the condition it's in right now because Ukrainians are backwards people right? It has nothing to do with being invaded right? Or does your blatant hypocrisy only apply to Muslims?

Turkey absolutely was colonized by Europeans via their puppet Atatürk. He committed a brutal campaign of cultural and actual genocide against the population. His policies meet every definition of genocide that applies to what the British did to Native Americans.

There was numerous coups that brutally suppressed Islamists in Turkey following Atashirk.

The British genocided 6.5 million Iranians during WW1 & WW2. In 1953 the US & UK overthrew the democratically elected government in Iran and installed a puppet and tyrant the Shah who would cater to their business interests. The US has had crippling sanctions on Iran since 1979 when the Islamic revolution overthrew their puppet. Israel and the US both bomb and assassinate Iranian officials and scientists regularly.

Saudi Arabia was called Arabia before the US & UK armed and funded their puppets Al Saud to overthrow the rightful rulers of Arabia in exchange for access to their oil. So Saudi Arabia is still technically colonized by the West.

Canada, Australia, New Zeeland

How are the indigenous populations of those countries doing?

Your argument of we killed all of them took their land and put white people in charge who are prospering due to help from other white people is vomit inducing.

Islamic countries persecute scientist today, and they have been doing so for centuries

Citation needed. The US & Israel is assassinating Iranian scientists like crazy.

"The west" is responsible for the vast majority of inventions used in modern society.

Funny how when you burn the entire world to the ground, commit insane genocide, and exploit resources you end up with the bulk of accomplishments.

Let's not forget it was a Muslim couple that created the vaccine for covid.

Beyond that Algebra, Algorithms, Alchemy, Robotics, Spherical Trigonometry, Optics, Modern Medicine, etc... Were all done or revolutionized by Muslims.

The first female surgeon in human history is a Muslim woman.

The world's oldest university? Founded by a Muslim woman Fatıma Al Fihri.

Your previously false claim of Islam not valuing education:

Read, ˹O Prophet,˺ in the Name of your Lord Who created—

created humans from a clinging clot

Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous

Who taught by the pen—

taught humanity what they knew not

First 5 verses to be revealed in the Quran 96

Allah is literally telling mankind that he created us to read, learn, and discover things we don't know.

Learning is a form of worship.

Two men, one learned and the other devout, were mentioned to God’s messenger, who then said, “The superiority of the learned man over the devout man is like mine over the most contemptible among you,” adding, “God, His angels, the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth, even the ant in its hole and even the fish invoke blessings on him who teaches men what is good.”

Hadith of the Prophet Muhammad PBUH

https://sunnah.com/mishkat:213

So I'm a pretty busy guy but I think I've demonstrated sufficiently enough that you have no idea what you're talking about.

Afghanistan LOL 😂 that's literally all that needs to be said go look at the Soviets, UK, & US. Let me guess Ukraine is in the condition it's in right now because Ukrainians are backwards people right? It has nothing to do with being invaded right? Or does your blatant hypocrisy only apply to Muslims?

And why wasn't Afghanistan a prosperous country before or after those invasions? It has been independent for quite a long time.

Turkey absolutely was colonized by Europeans via their puppet Atatürk. He committed a brutal campaign of cultural and actual genocide against the population. His policies meet every definition of genocide that applies to what the British did to Native Americans.

You really should take the tinfoil hat off buddy. Ataturk fought against the colonization of Turkey, literally.

Not to mention Turkey has been ruled by other parties for quite a long while.

The British genocided 6.5 million Iranians during WW1 & WW2.

What are you trying to reference here, the famine?

In 1953 the US & UK overthrew the democratically elected government in Iran and installed a puppet and tyrant the Shah who would cater to their business interests. The US has had crippling sanctions on Iran since 1979 when the Islamic revolution overthrew their puppet. Israel and the US both bomb and assassinate Iranian officials and scientists regularly.

You can come up with as many excuses as you wish, but it is just that coming up with excuses. Nobody forced the revolutionary government to attack an embassy after all.

Saudi Arabia was called Arabia before the US & UK armed and funded their puppets Al Saud to overthrow the rightful rulers of Arabia in exchange for access to their oil. So Saudi Arabia is still technically colonized by the West.

Saudi Arabia was called the sultanate of nejd. They conquered the kingdom of Hejaz, whose independence was guaranteed by the British. They aren't puppets of a colony by any means, they are and always have been an independent state.

How are the indigenous populations of those countries doing?

Your argument of we killed all of them took their land and put white people in charge who are prospering due to help from other white people is vomit inducing.

They are successful colonies. You are the only one implying they wouldn't be successful if they weren't white.

The US & Israel is assassinating Iranian scientists like crazy.

And that is the sole reason science isn't developed in Iran.

Funny how when you burn the entire world to the ground, commit insane genocide, and exploit resources you end up with the bulk of accomplishments.

And why didn't the Muslims, or anyone else colonize the Europeans? The fact is Europe has been scientifically and economically ahead for centuries now.

Let's not forget it was a Muslim couple that created the vaccine for covid.

The vaccine? Did they invent the Russian and Chinese vaccines too?

In any case there is a reason they didn't the vaccine in Turkey but Germany.

Beyond that Algebra, Algorithms, Alchemy, Robotics, Spherical Trigonometry, Optics, Modern Medicine, etc... Were all done or revolutionized by Muslims.

Yes, Muslim countries were ahead in science one millennium ago. Doesn't change the fact that they have been behind since.

Modern medicine, as you might guess, was developed in modern times. Mainly in Europe and North America.

The world's oldest university? Founded by a Muslim woman Fatıma Al Fihri.

"It was founded as a mosque by Fatima al-Fihri in 857–85" Just because it is a university today doesn't mean it always was one.

And once again scientific achievement a millennia ago doesn't mean scientific achievement today.

Your previously false claim of Islam not valuing education:

Read, ˹O Prophet,˺ in the Name of your Lord Who created—

created humans from a clinging clot

Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous

Who taught by the pen—

Hadith of the Prophet Muhammad PBUH

https://sunnah.com/mishkat:213

Actions speak louder than words.

Also, the word you translated as "read" also means "recite," as in telling Muhammed to recite these verses. I am astonished you couldn't even find a proper verse from the Quran.

And why wasn't Afghanistan a prosperous country before or after those invasions? It has been independent for quite a long time.

Afghanistan from the 16th-18th century was very prosperous as parts of the Khanate of Bukhara, Safavids, & Mughal Empire. Afghanistan as we know it today was never united. It was several different groups forced together by the British.

The Mughal Empire was the richest empire on earth until the genocidal savages from Britain invaded and destroyed it. It had more wealth than all of Europe combined. It was 24% of the world's economy.

Funny how Western economies are built on colonialism, raping and pillaging yet people like you lie and claim that the West is the beacon of civilization. Every people conquered by Muslims saw their quality of life improve. Every people colonized by Europe was reduced to shambles. That shows you how superior the values of Islam are to the values of Europe.

As for "independent for a long time"

Britain invaded Afghanistan from 1838-1842, 1878-1880, & 1919.

Beyond that it was part of "the great game" proxy war between the British and Russia/Soviets. That was for most of the 19th century & beginning of the 20th century.

From 1823-1839 & from 1842-1926 the Emirate of Afghanistan was a British vassle state.

These constant invasions and puppets resulted in the Afghan civil war 1928-1929

The Kingdom of Afghanistan lasted from 1926-1973

The Republic of Afghanistan lasted from 1973 till the Soviet invasion in 1979.

The Soviets invaded in 1929, 1930, & 1979-1989.

The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan lasted from 1978 to 1992.

Which was then overthrown by the US armed, trained, and funded Islamists (Al Qaeda & the Taliban).

Which again resulted in a civil war

The Islamic State of Afghanistan lasted from 1992-2002

Then the US invaded from 2001-2021

So when would you have liked Afghanistan to prosper?

Impressive how Western soldiers go to Afghanistan for a few months to a year living in more safety than any Afghan yet are not mentally strong enough to cope so they end up taking their own lives or needing lots of care. Yet a country and people that go through all that and then we get ____ such as yourself making the claims you make.

Here's the thing making stupid lies takes no time. Coming back with facts does.

What are you trying to reference here, the famine?

The British's genocidal weapon of choice. They did worse to India killing 40 million.

They are successful colonies. You are the only one implying they wouldn't be successful if they weren't white.

What happened to the INDIGENOUS PEOPLES in Canada, Australia, & New Zealand.

Of course killing people, committing genocide, and stealing their land is profitable. It still makes you a terrible person. It's disgusting that you're using this as an "argument for success".

sole reason science isn't developed in Iran

Not that this deserves a response but here's a taste of one

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_contemporary_Iranian_scientists,_scholars,_and_engineers

Funny how all the top universities in the US have Iranian professors.

Plus go to any engineering masters or PhD department and see how many Iranians are present.

And why didn't the Muslims, or anyone else colonize the Europeans?

Typical pea brain thinking being a barbaric savage is a sign of civilization. Why didn't the Chinese colonize Mongolia before the Mongols conquered China?

What's the most successful and effective vaccine in the world? The one created by Muslims.

It was also the first covid vaccine.

So not only were Muslims smarter & better they were also faster.

Modern medicine, as you might guess, was developed in modern times. Mainly in Europe and North America.

Are you seriously incapable of reaching correct conclusions while spoonfed information?

"It was founded as a mosque by Fatima al-Fihri in 857–85" Just because it is a university today doesn't mean it always was one.

It was the first university but keep lying. You're embarrassing yourself. She literally invented the concept of University.

Also, the word you translated as "read" also means "recite," as in telling Muhammed to recite these verses. I am astonished you couldn't even find a proper verse from the Quran.

Why are you committing such pathetic lies اقرأ means read... It can also mean recite because when you recite something you're reading it out loud. That's how Arabic works. It still encourages knowledge above all else.

Actions speak louder than words.

They do and I've proven it. The only telling thing about the present condition of the Muslim world is what the West did to it. It's an indication of the lack of civilization in the West not in Islam.

Just stop. You've embarrassed yourself enough. You had false information due to propaganda. I've given you correct information.

The difference between an intelligent person and a stupid person is an intelligent person changes their views when presented with new superior information. Which would you like to be?

Your shitty imperialism has caused nothing but pain and suffering for the people of those lands. You have divided the people and made them fight each other for nothing. You were so afraid of a Muslim nation becoming a superpower that you just bombed. It's disgusting to me how American vets who fought in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Vietnam are proud of it.

Afghanistan has gone through multiple invasions and wars

So has every single country, including the European ones.

Saudia Arabia was lied to by the British and French from the promised territory,

What are you talking about here? Saudi Arabia conquered the Kingdom of Hejaz which was guaranteed by the British though they did nothing to stop its conquest if anything they helped Saudi Arabia.

and Türkiye has a retard in power.

For the last 14 centuries?

Oh BTW, you forgot to come up with an excuse for Iran.

The US helped South Korea because it wanted more influence.

They also invaded the Korean peninsula and the entire peninsula was under Japanese colonization. Most gulf states were better of than South Korea. Not to mention Saudi Arabia, which was never colonized, or conquered and has been in the US sphere for longer than South Korea.

Singapore has good leaders,

What sort of excuse is that? Any success can be attributed to "good leaders," if you ignore everything else. Not to mention why has no Muslim country ever had "good leaders?"

Canada and New Zeeland are colonized territories that got rich with slavery or financial aid from the UK.

Canada and New Zeeland were profitable colonies to the UK, they gave back more money than the UK ever invested in them.

The British Empire ended its practice of slavery long before most Muslim countries. Why didn't Indonesian get rich off of slaves if New Zeelanders could?

Finland and Norway are special cases.

Meaning you couldn't come up with excuses for those.

Ireland lost most of it's population through a famine which was worsened by the UK and they don't have Northern Ireland

Yet they are an open and prosperous country. Even though they were colonized by the British, forced to starve, and lost some of their territories to them.

You needed Romans and Greeks to fuck you in the ass before you invented anything.

What are you talking about? You know Greek civilization predates Abrahamic religion right?

African and Eastern empires skipped the bronze ages and went straight to the Iron age

Again what are you talking about? We aren't talking about technological advancement in the year 3000BC, but today. Abrahamic religions didn't even exist for a significant chunk of the Bronze age. Not Islam mind you, but Abrahamic religion in general.

Brazil, Mexico, and most Hispanic Latino nations lag behind too and they have been independent for ages.

All have been independent for less time than Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Afghanistan. Also when they gained independence Africa and Asia were mostly uncolonized. Oh, and Ireland and Finland gained their independence in the last century.

The UK stole a shit load of money from India and its former colonies and still hasn't paid it back.

So? As I pointed out before, there are successful colonies and unsuccessful countries which weren't conquered. You clearly can't blame colonialism for everything.

Libya and Iraq were doing well and they got bombed by filthy Americans and Nato who claimed that they were helping the people free themselves.

Do you think Libya or Iraq were prosperous successful states before they collapsed? They were both brutal oil dictatorships, doing no better than the Gulf States today.

Your shitty imperialism has caused nothing but pain and suffering for the people of those lands. You have divided the people and made them fight each other for nothing. You were so afraid of a Muslim nation becoming a superpower that you just bombed. It's disgusting to me how American vets who fought in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Vietnam are proud of it.

I don't remember doing any of that, maybe you have me confused with someone else.

Maybe you should try to form a coherent argument instead of ranting about stuff I haven't done and conspiracies.

Actually that isn’t true, many mathematical and scientific advancements were done by Muslims while the rest of Europe and the world was stuck in the dark ages. This is a historical fact and many historians can agree with me on this.

the Greeks drowned themselves in the Aegean Sea, and the Romans jumped off Vesuvius after such words.

Ok name one major scientific advancement that came from the Muslim world in the past two hundred years

Over the last 200 years, most Muslim countries suffered colonialism. Pre colonization Islamic countries were actually ahead of most countries.

not an argument when we have China, Germany and Japan in front of us.

Those are exceptions but when looking at Egypt, Iraq, Syria they were relatively advanced

Why only in the last 200 years? Because Algebra was created before then?

Comment removed by moderator

Because the vast majority of humanity's scientific achievents have come from the past 200 years. So if there is a significant contribution to science from the Islamic world, it must have been from the past 200 years.

But we can go further. What significant achievement has the Islamic world made in the past 800 years?

For the first few hundred years of Islam, there were Caliphs like Harun Al-Rashid who made significant financial support for the sciences. There were many groups who huge focus on personal interpretation (like Ahl Al-Ra'y and the Mutazila). But then some Muslim scholars like Ibn Taymiyyah (Some also blame Al Ghazali here, which I also discuss on this thread elsewhere) shifted the focus away from personal interpretation and logic onto the word of Quran and Hadith. Ever since the middle east stopped doing science if favor of Quranic literalism, we see the decline of science in the Islamic world.

Men who celebrate the praises of Allah, standing, sitting, and lying down on their sides, and contemplate the (wonders of) creation in the heavens and the earth, (With the thought): "Our Lord! not for naught Hast Thou created (all) this! Glory to Thee! Give us salvation from the penalty of the Fire.

Where does this 1 particular verse say what you claim?

31:34 Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs. 

No person knows what he will earn tomorrow, and no person knows in what land he will die.

Verily, Allah is All-Knower, All-Awar

It is in Tafsir Ibn Kathir.

These were recorded only by Muslim. (and no person knows in what land he will die.) Qatadah said, "There are some things which Allah has kept to Himself, and they are not known to any angel who is close to Him or any Prophet who was sent by Him. (Verily, Allah, with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, ) no one among mankind knows when the Hour will come, in which year or month, or whether it will come at night or during the day.(He sends down the rain,) and no one knows when rain will come, night or day.(and knows that which is in the wombs.) No one knows what is in the wombs, male or female, red or black, or what it is.

Are you referring to this?

Not from the Quran. That is opinion of a 'scholar'. I get the point though.

Explain the Islamic Golden Age, and great Islamic thinkers such as Ibn Rushd/Averroës?

Also consider that modern Muslim countries suffer at the hands of imperialism and war, they do not 'lag behind' solely because of their religion.

I think the Islamic Golden Age has already been discussed quite extensively in the comments here.

In short, I believe that you can't determine a causal relation between the Islamic Golden Age and the teachings of Islam. There has been a lot of factors that contributed to the Golden age such as opening trade routes that allowed for greater communication between people, relative stability and peace, accessibility to older Greek texts, good leadership and policies that encouraged science etc.

Also I agree with you that imperialism has had an effect, but there could be several factors at play here, Orthodox Islamic thought is one of the factors. But imperialism cannot be the only reason, since the Ottoman empire was itself an imperial nation, and there was quite a lot of scientific stagnation there. In fact Imperialism started rather late in the Middle East in the 1800s far later than when Islam had already fell behind in science compared to Europe.

In fact Imperialism started rather late in the Middle East in the 1800s far later than when Islam had already fell behind in science compared to Europe

Really! USA got Independence in 1776, and imperialism started in 1800's?

Ottoman empire was itself an imperial nation, and there was quite a lot of scientific stagnation there.

https://www.scidev.net/global/opinions/lessons-from-the-ottoman-empire/#:~:text=in central Europe.-,Science and learning flourished throughout the period of empire, but,medicine, mining and military technology.&text=They were, for example, fascinated by European military technology.,-From the empire's

Ottoman empire went into scientific stagnation, yes, but you can't just attribute that to Islam. That's a feature of most empires, especially the Roman empire.

Islamic countries started to fall behind after the end of their golden age and the mongols destroyed most of the achievements of the Islamic golden age - a pretty big reasoning as to why they 'lagged behind' afterwards. Christian countries started to prosper at the end of their dark ages, these two conflicting eras between two entirely separate regions and cultures leads to the Christian nations becoming more advanced, the Islamic nations falling behind, and then imperialism while the Islamic countries are still recovering - which prevents their recovery.

Also, I don't believe one can attribute the teachings of Islam as a sole reason for the golden age, just as I believe one can't attribute Islam as a sole reason for why Islamic countries are 'behind'. Nor would I believe this even falls under the teachings of Islam, but rather the following of it, to deal purely with a religion's teachings neglects the fact that countries and institutions will often deviate from its teachings regardless.

I think that he proved his point by saying that islam had a factor to play even if it it wasn't the sole reason because in some way or another it did however there are many what ifs in history. Even if the belief of islam was different in that current time there's no 100% guarantee that it would have turned better.

Roman empire was no Christian the anglo barbarian empire that came after him were that's why they were in the dark age for 1k years Christianity is way worse bro

Yeah you're gonna need to elaborate on this to mean anything. That's like denouncing the entirety of Christianity as anti-intellectual because of the dark ages, and then justifying it with 'but it played a factor'.

I think you mean Muslims, not Islam. You pick and choose verses from different chapters that have different contexts to justify your claim.

Does Islam really allow you to question the lack of evidence for Muhammad's claims of meeting angels and talking to a god?

Why would a Muslim question his faith? That’s like asking If a dog can be a cat. Angel Gabriel(Angel Jibreel) told Prophet Muhammed(PBUH) the whole Quran from the words of Allah(God). In the verses that Allah sent down to Muhammad, there were many scientific miracles that scientists just recently discovered. One of them being the formation of sperm to baby in detail. So no Muslim questions the “lack” of evidence that Muhammed(PBUH) spoken with Angel Gabriel(Jibreel).

No. That's like asking if you can have critical thought in Islam and you've answered no. Even Muslim preachers today like Hamza Tzortis are speaking against the oxymoron of "scientific miracle". It just creates even more problems. If the Quran had any scientific foreknowledge, you could invent infinite clean energy from it's verses yet all the "scientific miracle" claims have been nothing more than waiting for actual scientists to do the work then reinterpret some Quranic verse later to fit.

To answer your question, Yes Muslims Can question their faith. I’ve questioned mine many times. And no Islam is not against science. Islam is against “Scientific” Miracles. You see Allah created Science, so saying “Scientific” Miracle is saying that Allah didn’t create science which is false. Islam advocates discovery and science but it also advocates that every non-man made thing we discover is made by Allah and not science.

A muslim here. Actually, the Quran challenges all mankind to bring something that is like the Quran in multiple verses

And if you are in doubt about what We have revealed to Our servant,1 then produce a sûrah like it and call your helpers other than Allah, if what you say is true.

Or do they claim, “He1 made it up!”? Tell them ˹O Prophet˺, “Produce one sûrah like it then, and seek help from whoever you can—other than Allah—if what you say is true!”

Or do they say, “He1 has fabricated this ˹Quran˺!”? Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Produce ten fabricated sûrahs like it and seek help from whoever you can—other than Allah—if what you say is true!”

and the fact that Allah sent us a book of 604 pages, 114 chapters and more than 6200 verses shows that the Quran is all about reason. Yes the reason to follow Quran because once you realize it is from Allah, your creator, sustainer, giver, judge, king and etc., you have nothing else to worry about or ask. You just follow, even if that requires you to go to Mars. Otherwise, if the God told you not to go to Mars, then it is not necessary and useless no matter how much you think its "good" and "better for us and humanity". If you do not believe in that then you have a problem in believing in God himself, forget the other concerns. But Allah is always merciful and wants from us to excel in all ways of life. Remember that the Muslims had well established Caliphates for more than a thousand years and have ruled people of many many backgrounds and to my simple knowledge this "backwards" in technology and intellectualism was never noticed. Actually on the contrary. Believing in the great and creative and rational creator of this universe will only make you excel in these fields not the opposite. The brain is a tool and Allah and his messenger teach us how to use it. Not every whim that comes to the brain is useful to think about and this is evident in our daily lives no matter how fancy it sounds.

Remember, it was Allah that created the human brain and gave it the ability to reason in order to know Allah and submit to him. Moreover, when Allah or his messenger tells the human being not think about something, is that by any chance an obstruction to reason? No, Allah is just telling the human being to use his mind in what is actually beneficial. Like who created God for example. Isn't this what humanity has been discussing for centuries, so what benefit did that bring? If there is a God we have no option but to listen to him because he is God and no matter how wise or knowledgeable we will be, Allah will be infinitely more than us in this regard. Same for mercy, forgiveness, creativity, power, wealth and so on. So our mission is really to make sure if the book is from God or not and that God is God not a pretender. That is why Allah is giving you the proofs and the Quran to assure you that it is he who is the true God, creator, sustainer, guide, judge, and the true owner and king of the day of judgment. Once you realize these facts you completely submit to him because questions then would be of no point.

Thank you for reading this far! Please let me know if you have any questions.

The challenge of the Quran is addressed to the detractors not to the believers. My point is that if the Quran wanted to encourage skepticism, it would have (for example) encouraged the believers to challenge the Quran as well, not just the disbelievers.

I have a question for you, and I genuinely don't know the answer. Do you know of any Muslim scholars or believing Muslims in general who have attempted to question these verses and tried their best to meet the challenge of the Quran? I would like to see a scholar genuinely try his best to bring 10 verses like the Quran and let everyone know why he was unable to meet the challenge.

This is false. The Quran welcomes skepticism and questioning. That is its challenge whether for a believer or non believer. It wants us strive hard and to keep digging for the truth of our reality. I am a believer and the only book that I love questioning till the world's end is the Quran. And it keeps delivering. That is its specialty and I have read and questioned many different kinds of books and people.

I question my believe often yet still come to the conclusion a world without God is illogical

The best way to ask Allah to strengthen it for you and guide you to the straight path and to actually increase in knowledge about it. The more you read the Quran and Sunnah and look outside the window you come to a conclusion that this book must have come from the God that created everything.

I hope this helps and PLEASE let me know if you need any help or have any questions. Asalamu Alykum.

Why would you challenge something that you believe in, you already accept it. Quran is not a theory book. It has the truth already, so what it says in the Quran is to go think again and again and ponder and seek the truth no matter what and shall come to you eventually.

Why would you challenge something that you believe in, you already accept it

I try to challenge my beliefs all the time, as any good skeptic should. I could be wrong.

It has the truth already,

This is the crux of the issue. You are assuming that the Quran is true, and you are trying to validate it. Good critical thinking would be to not assume anything, and see what evidence supports it to be true.

Many evidence in the Quran tell us that truth might not be clear to people right away and it may take time to happen and that it happens by the permission of Allah. And the cool thing about that is that the truth may come to everyone of us differently and at different times because we have different experiences, circumstances, ages, ways of thinking and lives in general. We are different. BUT when the truth comes to any of us we have to accept it and that is the mercy.

And say, "[All] praise is [due] to Allah. He will show you His signs, and you will recognize them. And your Lord is not unaware of what you do."

We will show them Our signs in the horizons and within themselves until it becomes clear to them that it is the truth.1 But is it not sufficient concerning your Lord that He is, over all things, a Witness?

Man was created of haste [i.e., impatience]. I will show you My signs [i.e., vengeance], so do not impatiently urge Me.

Notice how there is an assurance that Allah WILL show us the verses and WE WILL know them even if we deny that. Even if it comes to us within ourselves. WE WILL KNOW THEM. and That is from his MERCY because he has created and gave guidance and not just left his creation without guidance.

He said, "Our Lord is He who gave each thing its form and then guided [it]."

Moreover, things like the victory of truth over falsehood and the punishment of the wrongdoers and oppressors and the destruction of things that Allah has prohibited such as interest-based economies or the discovery of a scientific fact in the Quran or the proof that Allah's commands are wise and provide prosperity to human beings such as giving charity "zakah" and applying the punishments against criminals even if they seem to us at first that they are minor or "harsh" ... All these things take time to happen but they will happen. Whether we live to see them or not or whether they happen of the day of judgement.

And never think that Allah is unaware of what the wrongdoers do. He only delays them [i.e., their account] for a Day when eyes will stare [in horror].

So the point is not all verses of the Quran may be clear rightway. Does not mean they are not true. It only means that Allah is giving us a chance to think and be patient and this a mercy by itself.

And nothing has prevented Us from sending signs [i.e., miracles] except that the former peoples denied them. And We gave Thamūd the she-camel as a visible sign, but they wronged her. And We send not the signs except as a warning.

ٍSo Allah could have sent us verses that are undeniable such as a miracle coming down from the sky or him showing himself. But Allah knows that even though he had already sent them to the people before us they denied them so he is giving us our time to read and ponder and be patient. Because once these verses and miracles come, there is no chance to think again. Then you HAVE to believe or deny on the spot. Isnt the pondering option a better one and a manifestation of the mercy?

Unless you bring something like the Quran or even close to it. It still remains an undeniable proof that it is from Allah and worth your time to read it and ponder about its verses.

Check this verse out.

And We said after him [i.e., Pharaoh] to the Children of Israel, "Dwell in the land, and when there comes the promise [i.e., appointment] of the Hereafter, We will bring you forth in [one] gathering."

Look at the children of Israel, the Jews, after they were saved from Pharaoh by Allah, many of them worshiped the cow and spread corruption in the earth even until this day. This verse has many interpretations (i.e. Tafsirs) but one says that towards the end of time Allah will plot against them for their corruption and gather them in one place. Can you please look at the numbers of Jewish immigration to Palestine in the past century? It really looks that Allah is actually bringing them from all over the world to one gathering? Isn't that interesting?

So my advice here, in life too, is if you do not have to take a position about something right away, dont take it. Be patient and learn because it may be beneficial for you and that is the case of the Quran for those of who are patient.

Thank you for reading this far! Please let me know if you have questions. May Allah guide us all to his straight path. Amiin.

[The Structure of Scientific Productivity in Islamic Civilization: Orientalists’ Fables

](https://yaqeeninstitute.org/asadullah/the-structure-of-scientific-productivity-in-islamic-civilization-orientalists-fables)

This covers everything

All dogma is inherently anti-progress. Every region of the world has suffered a dark age. Currently, the Islamic world embodies this phase most emphatically.

The Arab world turned to the West after being astonished at the speed and ease with which Western cultures, and their technology, conquered their regions. Western values come attached to that desire for technology (and power).

The more conservative elements of various Islamic societies revolted against the invasion of western culture, leading to a series of conservative Islamic revolutions across the region.

This is a very simple overview.

speed and ease with which Western cultures, and their technology, conquered their regions

Which regions? The Arab world is vast and many Arab countries had different experiences when dealing with foreign powers.

The more conservative elements of various Islamic societies revolted against the invasion of western culture

While that is mostly true, you are focusing on 200 years of colonialism and not focusing on the 800 years of stagnation that came before this period. As I have mentioned, learning and studying in non theological schools were very different up until the 18th and 19th century in the Muslim world.

As an aside, I think it's an infantilizing towards Arab nations to blame everything on colonialism, and suggest that they did not have a hand in their own destiny. They did. Arab and Middle Eastern societies decided to pursue Islam rather than science and rationalism.

Furthermore, I would argue that an equally detailed case can be made concerning the anti-intellectual nature of all dogmas.

Western hegemony is founded in the Enlightenment movement. This has promoted secular, humanist values within a capitalist framework. The West is ascendant in-spite of its primary dogma, Christianity, not because of it.

To sum my argument. I don’t disagree with anything you’ve said. I make the point that anti-intellectualism is not uniquely Islamic; it exists in all dogmas including Christianity. This is evidenced by the cyclic nature of ‘dark ages’ globally.

You’ve made a compelling and well researched argument with your post - I’m going to attempt to answer off the top of my head as I did with my first response.

Which regions? The Arab world is vast and many Arab countries had different experiences when dealing with foreign powers.

The rough swath from Morocco to Iran. Each individual region in this broadly highlighted area absolutely has its own detailed history with foreign conquest.

While that is mostly true, you are focusing on 200 years of colonialism and not focusing on the 800 years of stagnation that came before this period.

I am. My answer only attempted to highlight one of the more recent historical reasons why.

As an aside, I think it’s an infantilizing towards Arab nations to blame everything on colonialism, and suggest that they did not have a hand in their own destiny.

Completely agree. Again, western colonialism is only one of the more recent factors that has shaped the region.

Arab and Middle Eastern societies decided to pursue Islam rather than science and rationalism.

Absolutely. While this is true of their world now, it has been true of all at some point in history. The fall of Rome precipitated a thousand years of backwards dogmatic thinking in Europe.

An interesting angle on your line of though is thus. The Islamic world preserved some of the knowledge of the Greeks during Europe’s dark age. However, given the length of time that their civilisation was ostensibly carrying the torch of progress, they offered little in the way of new thought. Particularly in the area of philosophy. Why do you think that was?

The "so what" is whether the thesis is true or not.

“So what”, from my question, is; even if Islam is backwards why would it mean that the Islamic God (Allah) isn’t real?

When scholars find a verse that is unreasonable, objectionable, or could cause doubts in people, what they do is they interpret it in a way that makes sense. If you question them further asking how they know this is the correct interpretation, they might tell you that it is the correct interpretation because it validates the Quran. This is the foundation of their epistemology and it is completely flawed since it is using the circular reason fallacy.

this is an absolute bold faced lie, and i know for a fact that you know this is a lie because you've been educated on it numerous times

any exegesis made by any exegete in history has to follow the set criteria and it has to go back to the prophet, the companions, or their students, no scholar who is a actually a scholar today will give a tafsir of a verse that is not based on evidence, nobody is inventing their own exegesis today except in some cases of new discoveries and even in that, it must have some sort of precedent in the historical tafsirs and it must be linguistically possible

"Brandolini's law, also known as the bullshit asymmetry principle, is an internet adage which emphasizes the difficulty of debunking false, facetious, or otherwise misleading information: "The amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude larger than to produce it.""

to debunk all the lies and misinformation in this post with actual evidence and references as opposed to the poor excuse for referencing and clear cherry picking done here would take an inordinate amount of time which you know nobody is going to commit to debunking an irrelevant person in an irrelevant corner of the internet

the clear purpose of posts like these are not to spark discussion or argue a point, its just machine gun tactics in which you can say "look, nobody can debunk all my points", as if thats some sort of criteria for truth

the history of islam and the interpretation well known to all muslims today is that islam has evidently always encouraged the seeking of knowledge, all over the quran it tells us to think, reflect and ponder, the first verse ever revealed was "read"

20:114 - "and pray, “My Lord! Increase me in knowledge.”"

58:11 - “Allâh will exalt in degree those of you who believe, and those who have been granted knowledge”

If anyone pursues a path in search of knowledge, Allah will thenby make easy for him a path to paradise; and he who is made slow by his actions will not be speeded by his genealogy. — Sunan Abi Dawud 3643

The Prophet said: “Whoever teaches some knowledge will have the reward of the one who acts upon it, without that detracting from his reward in the slightest.” — Sunan Ibn Majah, Vol. 1, Book 1, Hadith 240

The Prophet said: “The best of charity is when a Muslim man gains knowledge, then he teaches it to his Muslim brother.” — Sunan Ibn Majah, Vol. 1, Book 1, Hadith 243

that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “Whoever takes a path upon which to obtain knowledge, Allah makes the path to Paradise easy for him.” — Jami` at-Tirmidhi 2646

there are literally thousands of examples like this from the quran and sunnah, i could go on forever, the absolute dishonesty of a person who claims that islam is against seeking knowledge honestly has no bounds

OP used Quran verses and used the accompanying tafsir for each verse. You have not done the same, so I took it upon myself to cite them here.

20:114 - "and pray, “My Lord! Increase me in knowledge.”"

First, you truncated this verse to push an agenda.

Here is the full version of the verse:

Exalted is Allah, the True King! Do not rush to recite ˹a revelation of˺ the Quran ˹O Prophet˺ before it is ˹properly˺ conveyed to you,1 and pray, “My Lord! Increase me in knowledge.”

Secondly, this verse is referring to knowledge of the Quran as seen in the "Maarif-ul-Quran" tafsir:

Allah lightened this burden from the Holy Prophet ﷺ by assuring him that he need not worry himself about memorizing the Qur'anic verses which were revealed to him because He (Allah) would make it possible for him to remember them without any effort on his part. All that he was directed to do was that he should keep praying, رَّ‌بِّ زِدْنِي عِلْمًا (My Lord, improve me in knowledge). This comprehensive prayer includes a plea for memorizing that portion of the Qur'an which had already been revealed to him and a desire for what remained of it and for the ability to understand its true meaning.

As for the second Quran verse you cited:

58:11 - “Allâh will exalt in degree those of you who believe, and those who have been granted knowledge”

I will cite the Tafsir but before I do, don't you find the wording a bit peculiar? "those who have been granted knowledge". Since when is scientific worldly knowledge granted? In your argument prior to you listing these 2 verses, you specifically say:

that islam has evidently always encouraged the seeking of knowledge...

Allah in that verse doesn't say he'll exalt those who seek knowledge, he'll exalt those who are granted knowledge. As in knowledge of the Quran granted by Allah to them.

But don't let me interpret it with my kafir mind, let's see what Tafsir Ibn Kathir says:

(Allah will exalt in degrees those of you who believe, and those who have been granted knowledge. And Allah is Well-Acquainted with what you do.) means, do not think that if one of you makes room for his brother, or rises up when he is commanded to do so, that this will diminish his right or honor. Rather, this will increase his virtue and status with Allah, and Allah the Exalted will never make his good deed be lost. To the contrary, He will reward him for it in this life and the Hereafter. Surely, he who humbles himself by and before the command of his Lord, then Allah will elevate his status and make him known by his good behavior. the statement of Allah the Exalted

As for the Ahadith, I noticed one of them (Sunan Ibn Majah, Vol. 1, Book 1, Hadith 243) had an Is'nad of Da'if, so I have no idea why you would be citing it here as proof of your narrative because I am sure you would dismiss a Da'if hadith instantly if it was used to make a point against Islam. Am I correct in that assessment?

Secondly, if the "knowledge" used in the Quran was knowledge of the Quran itself and memorizing it, how can we make sure the "knowledge" mentioned in the Hadith refers to worldly knowledge?

there are literally thousands of examples like this from the quran and sunnah, i could go on forever, the absolute dishonesty of a person who claims that islam is against seeking knowledge honestly has no bounds

Why are you calling OP dishonest when it was you that used truncated verses, didn't bring their Tafsir and used a Da'if hadith (among others that weren't Da'if to be fair)?

First, you truncated this verse to push an agenda.

it was truncated because thats all that was relevant, you quoted the entire verse and that changes absolutely nothing

Secondly, this verse is referring to knowledge of the Quran as seen in the "Maarif-ul-Quran" tafsir:

this is the tafsir of ibn kathir, this is why its obvious hes cherry picking and so are you, why would you go to maarif ul quran who is this guy and who is he quoting from as evidence for his tafsir? it doesnt matter, there are way more authoritative tafsirs we can go to before maarif ul quran

(and say: "My Lord! Increase me in knowledge.") meaning, "Give me more knowledge from You." Ibn `Uyaynah said, "The Prophet did not cease increasing (in knowledge) until Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, took him (i.e. he died)."

it doesnt limit the knowledge to knowledge of the quran, tafsir jalalayn specifies knowledge of the quran and both interpretations are acceptable, they are both acceptable linguistically and with precedent from the early exegetes, i literally spent all of 2min looking up verses because it is so obvious to any muslim, even children know for a fact that the quran and the sunnah encourage seeking knowledge in all forms, it is rammed down everyones throats from a young age at home and at the mosque, you will only ever convince completely ignorant nobodies with terrible arguments like this, you can lie to all the non muslims but this horrible argument will never work on any muslim

I will cite the Tafsir but before I do, don't you find the wording a bit peculiar? "those who have been granted knowledge". Since when is scientific worldly knowledge granted? In your argument prior to you listing these 2 verses, you specifically say:

Allah speaks this way throughout the entire quran in many places because He is the ultimate cause of everything, if you gain knowledge from a secular university, you are still being granted knowledge by Allah because every cause goes back to Allah, and nothing would be possible without Him

Similarly when he says "16:79 Have they not seen the birds glide in the open sky? None holds them up except Allah. Surely in this are signs for those who believe."

do you think the arabs didnt know that if you break the wings of a bird it wont be able to fly anymore? Allah is talking about a different type of cause than physical causes, and even physical causes are all traced back to Allah

But don't let me interpret it with my kafir mind, let's see what Tafsir Ibn Kathir says:

?????????? this tafsir doesnt even mention knowledge

As for the Ahadith, I noticed one of them (Sunan Ibn Majah, Vol. 1, Book 1, Hadith 243) had an Is'nad of Da'if, so I have no idea why you would be citing it here as proof of your narrative because I am sure you would dismiss a Da'if hadith instantly if it was used to make a point against Islam. Am I correct in that assessment?

like i said, i spent 2min writing the reply, i wasnt doing an academic breakdown, when you machine gun 100 separate points in 1 post, you arent going to get any real discussion, you are just trying to throw shit at the wall and see what sticks, like i said, his terrible argument only works on ignorant people like you, no muslim would ever fall for any of this, the amount of evidence that encourages seeking knowledge in islam is greater than any other religion or ideology bar none, and all of the great academics and polymaths of history all quoted the religion as motivation for furthering their studies

da'if hadith can be used as an encouragement for good, but they are not authoritative when it comes to legislation, but if i saw it was da'if i wouldnt have bothered cause then i would have to explain this whole situation to ignorant ppl like you

Secondly, if the "knowledge" used in the Quran was knowledge of the Quran itself and memorizing it, how can we make sure the "knowledge" mentioned in the Hadith refers to worldly knowledge?

the same thing we know anything in islam, the interpretation is handed down just as the scripture itself was, we dont make our own interpretations, we understand the quran and sunnah the way the prophet, the companions and their students understood it

Why are you calling OP dishonest when it was you that used truncated verses, didn't bring their Tafsir and used a Da'if hadith (among others that weren't Da'if to be fair)?

because hes a bold faced liar and theres no getting around that anymore, he has had this exact conversation many times before and i've seen it with my own two eyes that he knew exactly what he was saying when he spread those lies, he knew that wasnt true and that is not how any scholar would ever come to an interpretation, he knows all the criteria that is required for an exegesis to be authoritative

nothing i did had any dishonesty behind it, the truncated verse changes absolutely nothing when you quote the irrelevant portions and the tafsirs backed me up and refuted you both

i could spend half my life compiling all the evidence that the quran and sunnah encourage seeking knowledge, try again with a topic that isnt complete and utter rubbish

it was truncated because thats all that was relevant, you quoted the entire verse and that changes absolutely nothing

You do not think this is dishonest? In any debate about Islam you always hear that context is important. In this case you forgo context and tell me you quoted only the relevant part which became relevant only because you ignored the rest of the text?

this is the tafsir of ibn kathir, this is why its obvious hes cherry picking and so are you, why would you go to maarif ul quran who is this guy and who is he quoting from as evidence for his tafsir? it doesnt matter, there are way more authoritative tafsirs we can go to before maarif ul quran

I did not cite tafsir Ibn Kathir for this verse because it's not translated to English or maybe I couldn't find it in English, but if you'd like, here it is in Arabic:

كان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم يقول: " اللهم انفعني بما علمتني وعلمني ما ينفعني وزدني علما والحمد لله على كل حال " وأخرجه الترمذي عن أبي كريب عن عبد الله بن نمير به وقال غريب من هذا الوجه ورواه البزار عن عمرو بن علي الفلاس عن أبي عاصم عن موسى بن عبيدة به وزاد في آخره وأعوذ بالله من حال أهل النار".

As you can see, the prophet is asking for knowledge from God. Unless God was running a science bootcamp specifically made for Mohamed, it's fair to assume Mohamed was asking for knowledge about the Quran.

it doesnt limit the knowledge to knowledge of the quran, tafsir jalalayn specifies knowledge of the quran and both interpretations are acceptable, they are both acceptable linguistically and with precedent from the early exegetes, i literally spent all of 2min looking up verses because it is so obvious to any muslim, even children know for a fact that the quran and the sunnah encourage seeking knowledge in all forms, it is rammed down everyones throats from a young age at home and at the mosque, you will only ever convince completely ignorant nobodies with terrible arguments like this, you can lie to all the non muslims but this horrible argument will never work on any muslim

You accuse me of lying to all non-muslims. There is no reason to make this personal, we're having a friendly debate here. If I present a wrong idea, correct it without resorting to personal attacks on my character and intentions.

Here you say "both interpretations are acceptable", meanwhile I've only seen the tafsirs (Jalalyn and Ibn Kathir and Maarif-ul-Quran) mentioning knowledge of the Quran. So until you present a Tafsir that specifies the other meaning of knowledge, I don't think your argument holds.

Secondly, what's being rammed down throats in Mosques isn't my concern. We are discussing Islam, not Muslims. I hope that distinction is clear to you. Because if you're talking about habits of people in Mosques how would one know what influenced those habits? Islam clearly talks about knowledge of the Quran and not otherwise.

like i said, i spent 2min writing the reply, i wasnt doing an academic breakdown, when you machine gun 100 separate points in 1 post

How is this an argument? No one forced you to spend only 2 minutes replying. No one forced you to reply at all, actually.

you arent going to get any real discussion, you are just trying to throw shit at the wall and see what sticks, like i said, his terrible argument only works on ignorant people like you

Again with the personal attacks on my character. In case you haven't noticed, so far the only person making unsupported claims is yourself. I'm not going to draw a conclusion out of that and call you an unnecessary name.

da'if hadith can be used as an encouragement for good, but they are not authoritative when it comes to legislation, but if i saw it was da'if i wouldnt have bothered cause then i would have to explain this whole situation to ignorant ppl like you

"but if I saw it was daif"? What? you didn't research what you were writing here? This makes it seem like you copy pasted information from a buzzfeed "Islam encourages education and seeking knowledge" article!

the same thing we know anything in islam, the interpretation is handed down just as the scripture itself was, we dont make our own interpretations, we understand the quran and sunnah the way the prophet, the companions and their students understood it

Yes, quran and sunnah which you have cited no evidence from to support their meaning of "knowledge" meant anything outside the Quran. Meanwhile, everything OP and I quoted and cited are from the quran and sunnah. Seems like we're the better muslims here.

nothing i did had any dishonesty behind it, the truncated verse changes absolutely nothing when you quote the irrelevant portions and the tafsirs backed me up and refuted you both

And you call OP a "bold" faced liar??? Brother, you haven't cited ONE tafsir that backed you up? Who are you lying to but yourself?

i could spend half my life compiling all the evidence that the quran and sunnah encourage seeking knowledge, try again with a topic that isnt complete and utter rubbish

I'd advise you to spend half your life doing something more worthwhile in that case.

You do not think this is dishonest? In any debate about Islam you always hear that context is important. In this case you forgo context and tell me you quoted only the relevant part which became relevant only because you ignored the rest of the text?

sigh, can you grow up? which part of the context of the full ayah changes anything? you're literally grasping at straws here, there are people in this world like CP who quote something out of context when the context gives the entire opposite meaning of what he stated, these people are blatantly dishonest like quoting "ibn al jowzi believes X and Y" when you read the context ibn al jowzi is telling you that he's quoting a fabricated report, thats dishonest, i literally gave the chapter and verse number, did you think i was afraid of the context? stop being obtuse, you know there was nothing dishonest about what i did

is this a mooseburrito alt account? b/c it sure sounds like it, and it sure seems like your taking everything i said about him very personal

i provided the tafsir of ibn kathir and it only says knowledge, you want to place a qualifier when one doesnt exist in the text, that shows more about you than anything else

As you can see, the prophet is asking for knowledge from God. Unless God was running a science bootcamp specifically made for Mohamed, it's fair to assume Mohamed was asking for knowledge about the Quran.

Are you assuming God only has knowledge of the quran? you realise God is All-Knowing right? "knowledge from God" is literally all possible knowledge

"but if I saw it was daif"? What? you didn't research what you were writing here? This makes it seem like you copy pasted information from a buzzfeed "Islam encourages education and seeking knowledge" article!

thats the type of response a lie like this deserves, like i said im not doing an academic response to a journal article, this is an irrelevant liar in an irrelevant corner of the internet spreading bullshit that no muslim will ever buy, so its not worth a serious response

Yes, quran and sunnah which you have cited no evidence from to support their meaning of "knowledge" meant anything outside the Quran. Meanwhile, everything OP and I quoted and cited are from the quran and sunnah. Seems like we're the better muslims here.

this deserves no research and no response because nobody that matters will ever believe this lie, im not wasting my time refuting a nobody about an obvious lie like this

And you call OP a "bold" faced liar??? Brother, you haven't cited ONE tafsir that backed you up? Who are you lying to but yourself?

he is a bold faced liar(im not sure why you quoted bold, both bold faced and bald faced are acceptable, open a dictionary) because of his quote about scholars coming up with their own interpretations when i know for a fact that he knows thats not true, interpretations have always, since the beginning of islam followed a certain criteria, and no 'scholar' would ever make up their own interpretation

you've been educated on it numerous times

I've already address the issue that the Quran talks about knowledge in the introduction of my post.

For 20:114 Maarif Maarif-ul-Quran says:

in the early days of revelation when angel Jibra'il (علیہ السلام) brought a Qur’ anic verse and recited it to the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، the latter would try to repeat it after him, lest it escapes from his memory.

So Quran is talking about knowledge of the Quran here.

For 58:11 Ibn Kathit says:

He said, "O Leader of the faithful! He has memorized Allah's Book and has knowledge of regulations of inheritance, along with being a proficient judge.'' `Umar said, "Surely, your Prophet has said, «إِنَّ اللهَ يَرْفَعُ بِهذَا الْكِتَابِ قَوْمًا وَيَضَعُ بِهِ آخَرِين» (Verily, Allah elevates some people and degrades others, on account of this Book.)'' Muslim collected this Hadith.

Same issue. Elevation is based on knowledge of the Quran.

Although I personally hate Islam, I do not think that Islam by itself is anti-intellectual. It is centralized states along with the effects of European colonialism that caused Islamic sciences to stagnate. People like to cite al-Ghazali as a Quran literalist that caused Islamic thought to become more literal, but that is too simplistic in understanding. Al-Ghazali was a mystic that did indeed trust the concept of reason but also admitted that intuition was needed in order to truly understand reality as reason itself may not be enough, and that sometimes the words in the Quran should be taken more seriously to reveal the larger truths of reality.

How do you explain the verses from the Quran and Hadith that I explain, which are anti Intellectual?

They aren’t exactly anti-intellectual but are there to make sure the believer continues to stay in the faith. No verses are specifically anti-science but to remind the believer that Gods existence cannot be denied

When you claim that your book is 100% true and should not be questioned, and the things in your book contradict science, then you are anti science.

if you think that believing that the sun sets in a pool of muddy water is core islamic doctrine, i believe you are sadly mistaken. if someone were to write a holy book and were to write some scientific fact that people believed was true into the book, and 3000 years later it is discovered it is not true, that does not mean your entire book disregards critical thinking. out of the many reasons i dislike islam, this isn't one of them.

Not necessarily. Welcome to the bizarre world of cognitive dissonance. Christians also partake.

It seems more like an article not a post on Reddit , the Quran is clear and yet you continue to talk about scholars , Quran encourages the use of reason but you come up with an interpretation of a human scholar and you say here you go look , I really wonder what’s the purpose of that ? Anyway , I will quote from an article

https://www.onthesigns.com/quran-invites-to-thinking/

Let us narrate directly from Quran.

The Quran clearly encourages to observe and study the signs of the truth in the whole universe:

We will show them Our signs in the horizons and within themselves until it becomes clear to them that it is the truth… (Quran al-Fussilat 41:53)

Say, [O Muhammad], “Travel through the land and observe how He began creation. Then Allah will produce the final creation. Indeed Allah, over all things, is competent.” (Quran al-Ankaboot 29:20)

Similar situations [as yours] have passed on before you, so proceed throughout the earth and observe how the end of those who denied was. (Quran Al-i-Imran 3:137)

Do they not see the birds controlled in the atmosphere of the sky? None holds them up except Allah. Indeed in that are signs for people who believe. (Quran an-Nahl 16:79)

The Quran encourages thinking and pondering. Sometimes in the form of a request:

Say, “I only advise you of one thing – that you stand for Allah, in pairs and individually, and then give thought.” (Quran as-Saba 36:46)

And sometimes by describing the people who give thought and do not simply pass over the signs and instructions around them:

Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day are signs for those of understanding; Those who remember Allah while standing or sitting or [lying] on their sides and give thought to the creation of the heavens and the earth, [saying], “Our Lord, You did not create this without purpose …” (Quran Al-i-Imran 3:190-191)

Several times the Quran has referred to the people who possess minds and have an understanding of the truth, for example:

There was certainly in their stories a lesson for those who possess minds (Quran Yoosuf 12:111) In some phrases, the Quran drives the listener to ponder by raising a question:

Say, “Is the blind equivalent to the seeing? Then will you not give a thought?” (Quran al-Ana’am 6:50)

Sometimes the Quran explains signs in the creation or recounts the instructive story of the former people and wishes the listeners to think over:

… That is the example of the people who denied Our signs. So relate the stories that perhaps they will give thought. (Quran al-Aaraf 7:176) …even so do We explain the signs in detail for those who think over (Quran Yoonus 10:24)

And it is He who spread the earth and placed therein firmly set mountains and rivers; and from all of the fruits He made therein two mates; He causes the night to cover the day. Indeed in that are signs for people who give thought. (Quran Ar-raad 13:3)

And We revealed to you the message that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them and that they might give thought. (Quran an-Nahl 16:44)

In some Verses the Quran actually blames the people who do not think over the signs or follow the mainstream type of thinking blindly:

Have they not pondered upon themselves? (Quran ar-Rum 30:8)

And when they are told to follow what Allah has revealed, they respond, “no, we will follow what we found our forefathers doing.” Even though their forefathers did not understand nor were they guided? (Quran al-Baqara 2:170)

Quran Invites to reasoning

In contrast to the view of some religions that entail their followers to forget reasoning and focus solely on heart, the Quran expresses the importance of reasoning and frequently asks people to use their intellectual power to find the right way. Nearly in seventy verses the words from the root “Taa’qul” meaning “to reason” have been used. The Quran alerts lack of reasoning in a striking statement:

Indeed, the worst of living creatures in the sight of Allah are the deaf and dumb who do not use reason. (Quran al-Anfal 8:22)

It is evident that the Quran does not mean the physically deaf and dumb, but those who do not want to listen to the truth, or those who do not wish to admit the truth when they hear it. It implies that the ears which are unable to listen to the truth and which are only used for listening to absurd and irrational things are deaf. Similarly, the tongue which is merely used to utter nonsense is in fact dumb.

The people, who do not reason, are those who do not make use of their intellect and their capacity of thought. Such people lack one of the main aspects of human beings. The Quran includes them among the beasts and even worse:

…They have hearts with which they do not understand, they have eyes with which they do not see, and they have ears with which they do not hear. Those are like livestock; rather, they are more astray. It is they who are the heedless. (Quran al-Aaraf 7:179)

The Quran teaches that the uncleanness is in fact due to lack of reasoning:

And it is not for a soul to believe except by permission of Allah, and He will place uncleanness upon those who will not use reason. (Quran Yoonus 10:100)

In several verses, the Quran requests from the people with wrong claims to produce evidence:

…Say, “Bring your proof, if you should be truthful.” (Quran al-Baqarah 2:111)

The Quran do not ban hearing other ideas for the purpose of research; even praises the people who listen to different ideas, analysis and accept the best one:

The people who listen to the speech and follow the best of it; those are the ones Allah has guided, and those are people of understanding. (Quran az-Zumar 39:18)

The Quran states the very principal facts by indicating logics behind them; for instance, the Quran reasons the unity of God by saying:

If there were gods in them [earth and heaven] other than the God, they would surely go to ruin … (Quran al-Anbiya 21:22)

The Quran relates the smart style of Ibrahim to show the idolaters the absurdity of their beliefs:

When the night covered him, he saw a planet, and he said: “This is my Lord.” But when it disappeared he said: “I do not like those that disappear.” So when he saw the moon rising, he said: “This is my Lord.” But when it disappeared he said: “If my Lord does not guide me, then I will be amongst the misguided!” So when he saw the sun rising, he said: “This is my Lord, this is biggest.” But when it disappeared he said: “My people, I am innocent of all that you associate with God.” (Quran al-Ana’am 6:76-79)

In harmony with its enlightening teachings, the Quran always explains the underlying principle behind its rules and guidelines (It should be noted however that explaining the advantages of a command in Quran does not necessarily mean that the purpose of it is limited to what has been mention). For example, the benefits of doing the prayer and fasting are stated in Quran:

… establish the prayer; Indeed, the prayer prohibits immorality and wrongdoing … (Quran al-Ankaboot 29:45)

O ye who believe! Fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you so that you may become righteous (Quran al-Baqarah 2:183)

The Quran has spoken about thinking, reasoning and knowledge nearly one thousand times. This is another indication that Islam is a firm and deep ideology, far from superstitions. Islam relies on thinking and reasoning. We do not find any phrase in the Quran supporting the use of force to gather followers.

the Quran is clear and yet you continue to talk about scholars , Quran encourages the use of reason but you come up with an interpretation of a human scholar and you say here you go look , I really wonder what’s the purpose of that ?

That's a problem to be discussed with Sunni Muslims, the majority sect of Islam.
