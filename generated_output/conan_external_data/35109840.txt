Islam is not a monolith and why it is important (opinion)

Both mainstream media and alternative online broadcasters, especially those from the western sphere, have a chronic habit of referring to and discussing Islam as a monolithic entity. The rise of Islamic terrorism for instance is often postured as a phenomenon characterized by the commitment of acts of violence in the name of Islam. While that may seem to be an accurate assessment of the situation at first glance, the statement will quickly reveal itself to be misleading and rather ambiguous once we begin to consider that there can be and there are indeed, various manifestations of a single faith. Therefore, we have to be precise in identifying which version of it we are referring to as appreciating the deep fragmentation of the Islamic world today is absolutely central in understanding, assessing and countering the problems that plague it. The Islamic world is as diverse as the groups that constitute it. The division that people are perhaps most familiar with is of that between the Sunni and Shi`ite sects. While this represents very broad macro divisions within Islam there are in fact also micro divisions within each individual sects that the general populace may be less aware of. For example, Sunni Islam itself can be categorized into different schools of thoughts such as the Hanafi, Shafi`i and Hanbali school of thought. This is a key point to take note of as in majority Muslim countries such as Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Pakistan etc. the system that they enforce is in part shaped after the state-sanctioned “version” of Islam and will differ in accordance to their belief systems. Case in point, Saudi Arabia, where an extremely conservative system, derived from their compliance to a very puritanical version of Sunni Islam known as Wahhabism, is strictly enforced. Wahhabism, in its extreme conservatism, relegates women to an almost subservient role in society where they are deprived of numerous privileges such as the simple right even to drive. On top of this stoning and beheading are still meted out as acceptable punishments for crimes such as apostasy, adultery and sodomy. This creates very heated points of contention between the Wahhabis and other more moderate Muslim scholars and organizations who go as far as to denounce the Wahhabi school of thought as being radical or even unislamic. In contrast to this there exist many other countries on the flip side of the spectrum who, similar to Saudi Arabia, adopt Islam as their state religion but are observably more moderate. These include countries such as Maldives, Brunei, Kosovo and Malaysia just to name a few. Their liberalism is reflected on their attitudes surrounding factors governing everyday life such as clothing or more prominently, through their treatment of women. According to the world economic forum Brunei Darussalam scored exceptionally well for gender equality in education, with the Sultanate ranking first in the subcategory of female enrolment in secondary and tertiary education. It is important to note that comparing states can be viewed as a matter of apples and oranges. There are a wide range of factors and forces both internal and external, that contribute to shaping a country and its attitudes. Saudi Arabia for example is a monarchy with its king bound to comply to sharia law. Malaysia on the other hand is an electoral democracy. With this in mind, it can be argued that the level of modernity experienced in Muslim countries can be more a result of political factors such as the adoption of democracy and secular politics over their more relaxed stance on religion. However, considering that these countries are Muslim majority countries, there is still value and meaning in making this comparison because their political attitudes does reflect to an extent their religious views and so the willingness of certain countries to adopt more liberal perspectives on issues supports the proposition that moderate Islam is no myth. Such stark differences in how the religion is practiced of course emphasises of the great diversity of the religion. Drawing our attention back to the treatment of the subject of Islam in discussions on the mainstream media, we can see then that there is a severe lack of precision in the terminologies used in the political dialogue surrounding the issue. When talking about the religious elements and motivations in the problems related directly or indirectly to Islam such as the rise of Islamic terrorism, mass immigration from the middle east to Europe or human rights there is little effort made to distinguish which specific ideology is being referred to criticized. This results in the promulgation of inaccurate blanket theories or assessments that not only do not apply to all Muslims but villainize the innocent. The lack of proper terms with which to refer to the problem also, in the words of Maajid Nawaz, robs the Muslim community of a lexicon with which to isolate the problematic group with Islam as whole so that they can be identified and dealt with appropriately. In this sense, Muslim apologists in the west whose main arguments against the rise of militant Islamism do Muslims a great disservice in refusing to acknowledge that yes, the problem is with Islam and the rise of militant Islamism within it and that the way forward is through internal reform. However, on the right, the hesitation or simple lack of desire to be more accurate can also be explained by a deficiency in the understanding of the complexities of the religion but also, more maliciously, a desire to advance a certain rhetoric that pits Islam against the west driven by deep seated sense of fear over what they do not understand. The impact of this on moderate Muslim`s are numerous and far reaching. On top of apportioning a substantial amount of the blame to innocent people it also turns them into targets of vitriol and general frustration. This creates deep fractures within society with pernicious effects that will only surface over time and plague inter-communal relations for generations if nothing is done. Hence, we must strive to exercise prudence and care when engaging in discussions on such loaded issues so as to avoid propagating fallacies that will serve to only worsen the very issues we are trying to resolve.
