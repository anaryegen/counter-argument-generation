Fills a gap in knowledge on the Muslim international student experience.

Investigates perceptions of British media representations of Islam.

Students perceive negative media representations of Islam.

Representations negatively impact on student well-being.

This paper presents findings from a qualitative study of British media representations of Islam. It offers a contribution to the literature on the international student sojourn by focusing on the unique experiences of the Muslim segment of that student body. International Muslim students perceived Muslim countries to be portrayed by the media as: (1) sympathetic to terrorism; (2) economically backward; (3) conservative. They believed that these representations led Muslims to be viewed by members of the host community with suspicion. This carried consequences for students’ self-esteem and sense of cultural identity. In order to correct misrepresentations portrayed by the media, some students took on the role of ambassador to promote the true face of Islam.

International students make an important contribution to the financial health of higher education institutions. Their recruitment is therefore fiercely competitive among the key providers of the UK, the US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand (Brown & Stephan, 2013). As international student numbers have grown, so the research into the international student experience has also steadily grown. Studies have focused on the stressors found in the new culture, which can deleteriously affect international student adjustment. These include loneliness, homesickness, racism, identity conflict, food shock and language difficulties (Brown & Holloway, 2008).

Research by Brown (2009) and Brown and Jones (2013) has shown that international Muslim students are particularly vulnerable to distress, caused by their encounter with unexpected representations of their faith, and to verbal or physical abuse. This research has alluded to the powerful role performed by the news media in creating misrepresentations and in fuelling prejudice. The findings presented in this paper derive from a research project whose aim was to explore international Muslim student perceptions of media representations of Islam. The focus is on Muslim students in a non-Muslim country. Very little previous research has been done on the topic, either from the student perspective or from the perspective of other categories of sojourner, such as migrants, refugees and long-stay tourists. The focus in this paper is on the implications of the misrepresentations of Islam for collective identity and the well-being of international Muslim students.

This is an inductive exploratory study on a topic that has received scant academic attention. As such, the relevant literature will be covered not only below, but it will also be tied to the emergent themes (see Jones, Brown, & Holloway, 2012). The international sojourn is defined by Ward, Bochner, and Furnham (2001) as a temporary stay in a new culture. Brown and Holloway (2008, p. 33) argue that ‘the move to a new environment is one of the most traumatic events in a person's life and in most

A qualitative approach to collecting data was chosen as the most appropriate way to access participants’ thoughts and feelings about media representations of Islam. It is also the approach most suited to exploratory investigation into a subject about which little is known (Denzin & Lincoln, 2010). Qualitative studies share some common characteristics, which Holloway and Wheeler (2010) describe as follows:

The data have primacy;

Research is context-bound;

Researchers immerse themselves in the

Analysis of the data led to the categorisation of perceived media representations of Islam in the news in three ways: (1) Muslims are terrorists; (2) Muslim countries are strict and conservative; (3) Muslim countries are dirty, backward and uneducated. The power of the media to influence people's views and behaviour was underlined by all participants. They felt that they experienced a direct impact of media representations through their (mis)treatment by members of the host society (England).

This paper has shown that international Muslim students share the view that the British media present a distorted view of Islam and Muslim countries. The latter are homogenised and presented as economically backward and religiously conservative. Meanwhile, the former is irrevocably linked with terrorism in media reporting of terrorist incidents. According to participants in this study, such misrepresentations have led to Muslims being treated with suspicion by the non-Muslim community, and to

Experience of Arab/Muslim women visiting relatives in the West and the management of stigma by association

2020, Tourism Management

The perception of Islamophobia is positively related to psychological distress and discrimination (Kunst et al., 2012, p. 50). For example, investigating the perceptions of British media representations of Islam, Brown, Brown, and Richards (2015) find that international Muslim students in the UK perceive Muslim countries to be portrayed by the media as “(1) sympathetic to terrorism; (2) economically backward; (3) conservative.” How Muslims/Arabs experience tourism in a context where anti-immigration, Islamophobia, and blatant or subtle forms of religious discrimination notoriously make sensational news should not be overlooked in contemporary tourist studies (Moufakkir, 2015).

Stigma is a well-established concept in the social sciences. It has recently found resonance in tourist studies. Stigma is a social-psychological condition that can be discrediting. This paper introduces stigma management in tourism studies and describes a set of stigma management strategies deployed by veiled and non-veiled Arab/Muslim women visiting relatives in Western countries where immigration is perceived to be a problem. These tourists straddle two stigmas at the destination –immigrant stigma and religious stigma, and associated stereotypes. Stigmatized tourists react differently to stigma and try to overcome stigma in different ways. A variety of stigma management strategies have been discerned and further discussed. A focus on stigma opens up new avenues for research on cross-cultural studies in contemporary tourism.

The stigmatized tourist

2015, Annals of Tourism Research

Framed in the global political climate following the terrorist attacks of 9/11, “widespread distrust toward Muslims emerged in the form of anti-Muslim sentiment frequently defined as Islamophobia” (Stephenson & Ali, 2010, p. 236). For example, research has shown that international Muslim students are particularly vulnerable to “distress, caused by their encounter with unexpected representation of their faith, and to verbal or physical abuse” (Brown, Brown, & Richards, 2015, p. 50). There is documented evidence concerning increased levels of Islamophobic hostilities taking place in North European states (in tourism, see for example Scott & Jafari, 2010).

This paper explores the tourism experience of the Arab and Muslim Tourist (AMT) visiting a (Western) developed country for tourism, from a critical socio-cultural perspective. Encapsulated in Goffman’s theoretical underpinning of the study of stigma, and informed by Said’s Orientalism, I used in-depth interviews to understand the tourism experience of the AMT in an immigration context, situated in what Goffman refers to as the ‘normal-deviant drama’. In a contemporary climate of xeno/ethno-racism, The AMT is stigmatized by association with his/her nationals (or par default by semblance to those nationals), who constitute a visible ethnic immigrant group in the visited country. His/her actual social identity becomes confounded with an ascribed virtual identity. As a moral issue, stigmatization spoils the tourist identity of the AMT, resulting in feelings of shame, confusion, and anger. The rise of anti-immigrants discourse and sentiments, and the rise of religious extremism practices and sentiments in the world, begs for more attention in contemporary tourist studies.
