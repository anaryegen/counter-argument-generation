The differing views that various parties and states hold regarding the efficacy of their lslamisation approach and its impact nationally remain unresolved until today. This paper is an attempt to assess the well-being of countries in an objective and scientific manner. It introduces a new Islamic Index of Well-being (IIW) for Muslim Majority Countries (NMCs), which is based on principles derived from the Qur'an and Sunnah to comprise the key fields of Personal Religiosity and Social Interactions. These two elements are given equal weighting. The Religiosity element is obtained from published data of the Pew Research Center for indicators of the percentage of Muslim citizens who perform obligatory practices of praying five times daily, men attending the mosque at least once weekly, and Muslims fasting in Ramadan (or paying zakah). Research has shown a direct, positive relationship between Religiosity levels and psychological well-being. Five parameters are assessed for the Social Interactions performance of MMCs: secondary education, good status of women, care of children, limited income inequality and elimination of corruption. From an Islamic perspective, governments are required to assist weaker members of society, which is reflected in indicators used to determine the status of women, children and the poor. The resultant IIWs calculated for the 27 (Arab Gulf countries were not surveyed) out of a total 50 MMCs plus Nigeria show that the highest IIW levels are in Southeast Asia (Malaysia and Indonesia take the top positions), followed by Senegal and the Palestinian Territories. Middle Eastern countries follow, then sub-Saharan African countries with overlap, while former Communist bloc countries generally have the lowest indices. 2012 IIWs represent a base level for the measurement of country improvements in years to come.

To determine the condition and progress of MMCs in terms of the attainment

of well-being by their citizenry there is a need to identify suitable indicators for an

objective assessment that would allow one to rate the countries accordingly. This

would provide numerous benets; not the least, to enable the Ummah to identify

countries that successfully demonstrate a high level of well-being, which could

possibly represent models for the leaders of other countries who are striving to

realise the virtues of Islam.

A NEW ISLAMIC RATING INDEX OF WELL-BEING

FOR MUSLIM COUNTRIES

Abstract: The differing views that various parties and states hold regarding

the efcacy of their Islamisation approach and its impact nationally remain

unresolved until today. This paper is an attempt to assess the well-being of

countries in an objective and scientic manner. It introduces a new Islamic

Index of Well-being (IIW) for Muslim Majority Countries (MMCs), which is based

on principles derived from the Qur’an and Sunnah to comprise the key elds

of Personal Religiosity and Social Interactions. These two elements are given

equal weighting. The Religiosity element is obtained from published data of

the Pew Research Center for indicators of the percentage of Muslim citizens

who perform obligatory practices of praying ve times daily, men attending

the mosque at least once weekly, and Muslims fasting in Ramadan (or paying

zakah). Research has shown a direct, positive relationship between Religiosity

levels and psychological well-being. Five parameters are assessed for the

Social Interactions performance of MMCs: secondary education, good status

of women, care of children, limited income inequality and elimination of

corruption. From an Islamic perspective, governments are required to assist

weaker members of society, which is reected in indicators used to determine

the status of women, children and the poor. The resultant IIWs calculated

for the 27 (Arab Gulf countries were not surveyed) out of a total 50 MMCs

plus Nigeria show that the highest IIW levels are in Southeast Asia (Malaysia

and Indonesia take the top positions), followed by Senegal and the Palestinian

Territories. Middle Eastern countries follow, then sub-Saharan African

countries with overlap, while former Communist bloc countries generally have

the lowest indices. 2012 IIWs represent a base level for the measurement of

country improvements in years to come.

The fty Muslim Majority Countries (MMCs) in 2010 had 1.2 billion of the total

Muslim population of 1.6 billion - 23 percent of the world population (Table 1).

The Muslims comprise the Muslim Ummah or world community of believers in

Islam. The MMCs are located in specic regions: the Middle East, West Africa,

East Africa, South Asia, Central Asia, Southern Europe and Southeast Asia.

Guinea-Bissau is included as an MMC on the basis that a reputable source cites

Muslims as being 50% of its population.1 Nigeria with a Muslim population of

75 million, though included in this assessment, may not yet be an MMC but is

expected to become one by 2030.

What might “well-being” from an Islamic perspective be, and how could it be

measured? One approach is provided here for assessing the overall condition of

a population and the general state of its citizens. God, The Most High, states in

Verily the most honoured of you in the Sight of Allah is (he who is) the most

righteous. (Al-Hujurat, 49:13)

This could be understood to mean that the “best” country in terms of Islamic

well-being is the one that can be shown to possess the greatest proportion of

righteous individuals in the Muslim population who display God-consciousness.

In the Qur’an these are the muttaqun and are described as follows:

True piety [is] to believe in Allah and the Last Day, and the Angels, and the Book,

and the Messengers; to spend of your substance, out of love for Him, for your kin,

for orphans, for the needy, for the wayfarer, for those who ask … to be steadfast

in Prayer, and practice regular Charity … Such are the people of truth, the God-

conscious (al-muttaqun). (Al-Baqarah, 2:177)

The combination of belief (Iman) and righteous practices (‘amal Salihah) leads

to an internal satisfaction of the heart, which could be understood as indicating

Islamic well-being, as suggested by the following verse:

Those who believe and whose hearts nd satisfaction in the remembrance of Allah;

for without doubt in the remembrance of Allah do hearts nd satisfaction. For those

who believe and work righteousness is (every) blessedness. (Al-Ra‘d, 13: 28-29)

If the performance of righteous deeds is the ultimate proof of correct belief

and God-consciousness, then when assessing what we term Personal “Islamicity”

(Islamic Religiosity or Acts of Worship) in each Muslim country, emphasis ought

to be placed upon the key practices of Islam, rather than the sole act of declaring

the Faith (shahadah). Whereas the declaration of Faith is the bedrock requirement

for all who claim to be Muslim, the number of such Muslims includes a portion

of nominal Muslims who do not carry out all of the obligatory prayers, fast or pay

zakah. Emphasis has been given in the current assessment to identify practicing

Muslims since these are the ones who will most likely experience the benets

of well-being from performing their acts of worship. For example, performing

regular prayers prevents one from immoral actions:

Establish regular prayer, for Prayer restrains from shameful and unjust deeds. (Al-

recognised that researchers did not cover some countries with signicant Muslim

populations, such as the Gulf Arab countries. The Pew Forum’s survey included

every nation with a Muslim population of more than 10 million, except Algeria,

China, India, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, “where political

sensitivities or security concerns prevented opinion research among Muslims”.

These are important Muslim communities that, it is hoped, will be covered in

future surveys. The minimum number of Muslims interviewed in the MMCs in

the 2008-09 survey was 373 in Guinea-Bissau, and in the 2011-12 survey, 551 in

Lebanon. Otherwise, the range in Muslims interviewed in MMCs in 2008-09 was

811 (Chad) to 1452 (Djibouti), and 788 (Albania) to 1918 (Bangladesh) in 2011-12.

Similar to the approach taken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation

and Development (OECD) in developing their well-being indicators,4 the

indicators to assess Islamic well-being have been selected for two quality criteria:

rst, conceptual soundness and relevance, and secondly, for their reliance on data

of high quality based on established standards from reputable sources such as the

United Nations, the World Bank, and Transparency International. The Islamic

well-being indicators used in the current assessment are considered to be in a state

of development; if better indicators can be found, these could be incorporated in

The key parameters from the Pew Center report that are available for the

current study to assess Personal Islamicity (Acts of Worship or Ibadat) include

the profession of faith, that is, the percentage of the Muslim population who

say they believe in one God and the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), and then

the practices or pillars of Islam, which comprise the obligatory ve times daily

prayer (salah) and attendance at congregational prayers at a mosque (masjid)

on Fridays,5 fasting (Siyam) during Ramadan, and giving alms (Zakah). For the

latter two criteria the writer proposes to use a single indicator, the percentage

of the Muslim population fasting, unless the percentage paying zakah is higher,

in which case it would be the one used. In a Muslim community, only those

whose incomes exceed a minimum threshold are required to pay zakah and so

the percentage of people fasting would normally at least equal the percentage

Not all Muslims are required to perform the pilgrimage to Mecca, the haj,

which is limited to those who can afford it and are well enough to sustain the

hardships involved. Performance of the haj is therefore dependent on factors

such as wealth and health status as well as proximity to Saudi Arabia. Due to

the various factors constraining one’s ability to perform haj and the complexity

involved in assessing comparative religiosity levels from a nation’s collective

haj performance, we have not included assessment of this element in a country’s

Research since the mid-2000s indicates strongly and consistently that Muslims

displaying higher religiosity in the main enjoy a greater sense of subjective or

psychological well-being than those less religious.2 The benets of Personal

Religiosity are in line with the character of the practicing Muslim as described

Verily, man was created very impatient; irritable when evil touches him; and niggardly

when good reaches him. Except those who are devoted to Salah [prayers] - those

who remain constant in their Salah - and those in whose wealth is a recognized

right for the (needy) who asks, and him who is prevented (for some reason from

asking). (Al-Ma‘arij 70: 19-25)

Key parameters will be identied for Personal Religiosity as well as state societal

responsibilities (Social Interactions) that are believed to be both an objective and

reliable representation of well-being from an Islamic perspective. The benets of

determining the ensuing well-being rating are believed to be the following:

1. Identifying role model countries that demonstrate a high level of well-

being for other less-well placed countries.

2. Providing a tool using the identied parameters and assessment criteria

or indicators for state planning efforts to help identify development

targets for improvements to enhance well-being.

3. Identifying countries that although performing well in terms of Personal

Religiosity, have limited material resources for development and are

worthy of nancial support to enable them to advance towards a condition

of more holistic well-being.

This assessment and rating of the well-being status of Muslim-majority

countries represents the rst of its kind, to the knowledge of the author. It provides

comparative information on key indicators selected based on Islamic and ethical

considerations. May Allah enlighten us further on this subject for the benet of

Methodology, Parameters and Data Acquisition

The August 2012 report of the Pew Research Center, based in the United States,

entitled “The World’s Muslims: Unity and Diversity”,3 is of clear relevance

to our current assessment. This report from The Pew Forum on Religion and

Public Life provides statistical data that allows a semi-quantitative evaluation of

the Personal Islamicity (or Religiosity) of Muslims interviewed in 15 countries

during 2008-2009 and 24 other countries in 2011-2012. The report was based

on a large number (38,000) of face-to-face interviews, though it should be

Education to Secondary Level

The Qur’an and the Sunnah are replete with appeals for Muslims to enhance their

knowledge, and not only religious knowledge:

Are those who know and those who do not know alike? (Al Zumar, 39:9)

The superiority of the learned man over a [mere] worshipper is like my superiority

over the least of you.8

It is the duty of an Islamic government to ensure that all citizens, male and

female, receive an education so as to understand the essentials of Islam, and

to provide a means of livelihood for themselves and their families. Today a

secondary education is really the minimum required for a person to achieve well-

being. According to the author of “The Ideal Muslim Society”, education in

Muslim Society is essential for both boys and girls and must be made available.

Failure to provide education should be regarded as an illegal action on the basis

of this legal responsibility.9

An indicator to assess this is the adult literacy rate for both genders aged 15

and over. The OECD uses a similar (though stricter) indicator for measuring this

parameter (i.e., per cent of the adult population, 15 to 64 years of age, holding at

least an upper secondary degree) and emphasises the major secondary benets

deriving from education: “Using controls for income, race, social status and other

variables, research has shown that education tends to be correlated with better

health, lower crime, political and community participation and social cohesion.”

It also has both immediate and long-term positive effects on self-reported

From Islamic considerations, two indicators are chosen to assess this parameter.

First, Islam in no way emphasises the education of men over women, and the

Prophet stressed the obligatory duty of every Muslim woman (and man) to seek

Search for knowledge is a sacred duty imposed on every Muslim man and woman.11

Women have the same need as men to recognise the obligatory nature of the

acts of worship they are required to perform according to Islam. They are also the

main inuence in the upbringing of their children as good Muslims and so need to

have correct knowledge to impart. Women, like men, are encouraged to read the

Qur’an on a regular basis. All of this requires them not only to read and write, but

to absorb and understand knowledge and act upon it. Men may be the protectors

of women in the traditional Islamic world view with the responsibility to provide

DAUD ABDUL-FATTAH BATCHELOR

Emphasis in the rating of countries in the present study will be given rst and

foremost to the criterion of performing the prescribed daily prayers that Allah

Himself has prioritised:

The Messenger of Allah said, “The rst deed that the servant will be held to account

for on the Day of Judgement is the prayer. If it is good, he will be successful and

safe, but if it is not good, he will be of the unfortunate and wretched.” (Tirmidhi)

The beliefs and practices discussed above are related to the relationship of

the worshipper with his Creator. However, an observant Muslim also has duties

towards his fellow humans, which represent the eld of Social Interactions or

Mu’amalat. These are related to the ve fundamental and essential objectives

(maqasid) of the Shari‘ah, namely the protection of faith, life, lineage, intellect

and property. Abu Hamid al-Ghazali was generally skeptical of using maslahah as

a source of law but approved it if it is in harmony with the essential objectives of

the Shari‘ah. This is in line with the basic denition of maslahah, which consists

of considerations of well-being that secure benet or prevent harm (mafsadah) but

which are simultaneously harmonious with the Shari‘ah objectives.6 Combating

corruption, bribery and ofcial abuse would then also fall within the purview of

A country’s leaders as servants of the community are responsible to Allah to

improve the welfare of the population and guide them to do good as implied by

the Prophet PBUH in the following hadith:

A ruler who has been entrusted with the affairs of the Muslims, but makes no

endeavour (for their material and moral uplift) and is not sincerely concerned (for

their welfare) will not enter Paradise along with them. (Muslim 1:82)

A major test for well-being is particularly how the Muslim country or

community discharges its duties towards weaker and disadvantaged members

of their society who could easily become neglected, especially, children, women

and the poor. Their uplift reects positively on the overall health of a society.

Since one important legal maxim of Shari’ah states, “The imam’s (head of state)

performance is judged by reference to people’s welfare,” Mohammad Hashim

Kamali pointed out that this becomes the single most important criterion by

which to evaluate success or failure of a government in Islam.7 On this basis,

the following parameters of Social Interaction are seen as being necessary for a

community to display true well-being: (1) a secondary education for all, (2) good

treatment of women, (3) care of children, (4) limited income inequality, and (5)

elimination of corruption. These parameters are also chosen over others since

relatively comprehensive annual data to assess them are easily available from

reputable published sources.

Adolescents who live in broken families are more likely to engage in substance

abuse, exhibit behavioural problems, have poor academic performance, and

engage in risky behavior.15 The indicator proposed to reect the above criterion

is the United Nations’ country “crude divorce rate”, based on the number of

divorces per 1,000 mid-year total population.

The second proposed indicator here is the UN country “under-ve mortality

rate”, the probability per 1,000 that a newborn baby will die before reaching age

ve. High rates indicate either negligence or the economic inability of states to

properly care for their newly-born citizens, and researchers have argued that high

infant mortality rates correlate very strongly with state failure.16

Equitable Distribution of Wealth

In the Islamic world-view, as expounded by Muhammad Asad, Muhammad

Hashim Kamali17 and others, governments are obliged to protect the disadvantaged

in accordance with the juristic principle that “averting of harm from the poor

takes priority over the welfare of the wealthy”.18 Muhammad Asad has argued

that the state is responsible to provide its citizens with basic economic facilities,

citing the hadith which begins: “Behold, every one of you is a shepherd; and

everyone is responsible for his ock. Thus the Imam [the government] that has

been placed over the people is a shepherd, and is responsible for his ock.”19 Asad

considered that Islam demands a society that provides not only for the spiritual

needs of its members but for their bodily needs as well, and that a state “to be

truly Islamic, must arrange the affairs of the community in such a way that every

individual, man and woman, shall enjoy that minimum of material well-being

without which there can be no human dignity, no real freedom and, in the last

resort, no spiritual progress”. In an Islamic state “there shall be no soul-grinding

poverty side by side with afuence”.20 This is the purport of Prophet Muhammad

He is not a faithful who eats his ll while his neighbour remains hungry by his side.21

Asad reiterated that poverty in the midst of plenty is a negation of the very

principle of brotherhood for which Islam stands, since the Prophet had stated:

By him in Whose hand I repose! No one has real faith unless he desires for his

brother that which he desires for himself.22

Consequently he believed, “The Islamic state must see to it that equity prevails

within the community, and that every citizen – man, woman and child – shall

have enough to eat and to wear, shall be succoured in case of illness, and have

a decent home in which to live.” This view is buttressed by considering Caliph

support, but women in the family could have greater intelligence and Islamic

and temporal knowledge. Consequently, there are no grounds for discrimination

against women in this criterion. Status of women is partially assessed using the

United Nations’ published data on Female/Male Ratio in Secondary Education of

the country’s population who are 25 years and older.

A second indicator proposed to assess women’s status in a given country is the

published country data on Maternal Mortality Rate per number of live births. This

would be in accordance with the Qur’an’s specic call, in a passage highlighting

the sacrices women make in giving birth, to:

Reverence Allah through Whom you demand your mutual (rights), and (reverence)

the wombs (that bore you). (al-Nisa’, 4:1)

The Prophet (PBUH) has also stressed the great importance of respecting one’s

A man came to the Prophet and said, “O Messenger of God! Who among the

people is the most worthy of my good companionship?” The Prophet said: “Your

mother.” The man said, “Then who?” The Prophet said, “Then your mother.” The

man further asked, “Then who?” The Prophet said, “Then your mother.” The man

asked again, “Then who?” The Prophet said, “Then your father.”12

Logically then, in a truly Islamic society special care would be taken to minimise

maternal mortality, which can be an indicator of how a country treats expectant

Providing a healthy nurturing family environment for the upbringing of children

is a key Islamic value, so two indicators are proposed to assess the care of children

Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) has said:

The most hated of permissible acts to Allah is divorce. (Abu Dawud, Hadith 1863)

Children are generally the most severely impacted when parents divorce. Divorce

increases the risk that children will suffer from psychological and behavioural

problems, and since young children develop a bond with their primary caretaker,

taking this person away too early disturbs the social and emotional development

process, which might result in serious long-lasting problems.13 It is clearly in the

interest of the community then to minimise the incidence of divorce. Divorce

also has other serious side-effects, and research has shown an increase in violent

crime resulting from the easing of divorce procedures in the United States.14

decrees and serious human rights abuses. Negative features such as these would

obviously distance citizens from a state of well-being.28

The indicator that is proposed to assess a country’s corruption level is the

Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) developed by Transparency International.29

The 2012 CPI is a composite index based on multiple expert opinion surveys that

poll perceptions of public sector corruption in 176 countries around the world.

It scored countries on a scale from zero to one hundred, with a score of zero

indicating extreme levels of perceived corruption.

Rating the Comparative Well-Being of Muslim Majority Countries

In light of the foregoing, the present writer proposes a semi-quantitative method

for identifying the relative position of countries in terms of well-being. Each of

the parameters previously discussed is identied in quantitative terms according

to published statistics. All MMCs for which numerical data is available are

then “banded” into ve 20-centile bands ranging from what is termed “very

good”, to “good”, “average”, “fair” and “poor”. There is no attempt here to

identify an absolute quantitative gure as ideal. The middle band represents

average MMCs while the top band represents countries that reect a measure

of relative excellence in a particular eld. This however should never encourage

complacency since levels of achievement in seeking Allah’s good pleasure could

be considered virtually innite.

In the semi-quantitative assessment used for each parameter and indicator,

countries are then awarded points of 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, in order from the top band to the

bottom for each of the ve bands. The writer proposes for this exercise that each

indicator and parameter has equal weighting. Also, the assessed outcome value

out of ve for each of the Personal Religiosity and Social Interaction positions

is given equal weighting and then combined to provide a total well-being index

gure out of ten. A benet of giving equal weighting in all these cases is that

although it is arbitrary, it is not subject to any personal bias. In those cases where

two indicators are used to determine a value for a parameter (e.g. divorce rate

and under age of 5 mortality rate as indicators for welfare of children), the value

is also obtained by averaging the score of each indicator. The positions of the

MMCs in terms of the Islamic Index of Well-being (IIW) are then determined.

The resultant ranking of countries is approximate rather than rigorously exact.

However, it should nonetheless be meaningful and unbiased.

Well-being indices have been a topic of deep interest in the West, notably

from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD),

which described the existence of various contentious views on the underlying

philosophy and the selection and weighting of the various component indicators

used.30 Examples of such well-being measures, which are generally of a composite

Ali’s (RA) interpretation of Surah Baqarah, verse 177 and the verse below, that

“God Most High has made it obligatory on the rich to provide the poor with what

is adequate for them”:23

As to the Righteous … in their wealth and possessions was a portion due to him

who begs (the needy) and to him who was prevented (from asking). (al-Dhariyat

Muhammad Ali Al-Hashimi also highlighted the importance of limiting

income inequality: “This social balance that Islam seeks to achieve by narrowing

the gap between rich and poor is in direct contrast to the society that has drifted

away from divine guidance, in which you will nd an astoundingly huge gap

between rich and poor.”24

Both the Fordham Index of Social Health and the Osberg Index of Economic

Well-being use the Gini index of inequality to formulate their indices. An ideal

Islamic economic system does not require absolute equality, but one would

not expect extreme distributions between the rich and poor. As highlighted by

the OECD in considering economic well-being, “A certain degree of income

inequality may be desirable for ensuring incentives for work and may also reect

the preferences of individuals for a particular lifestyle, place of living, occupation

and balance between leisure and work.”29 However, in developing countries, the

inequality should not be a reection of the wealthy disregarding the needs of the

poor, or even worse, the poor being unable to progress due to corruption at the top.

The Income Gini coefcient is therefore the indicator proposed to be used here

to reect social equity. It is a measure of the deviation from an equal distribution

of the distribution of income among households within a country. A value of 0

represents absolute equality where every household has the same income, while

a value of 100 represents absolute inequality where one household receives all

of the country’s income.26 While the main source of this data is the World Bank

2011 gures, those not available here are additionally sourced from the Global

Peace Index estimates.

Elimination of Corruption

Although many majority Muslim countries in fact exhibit high levels of corruption,

the Islamic position against this is clear. The Prophet himself (PBUH) declared:

Cursed is the one who bribes and the one who takes a bribe.27

Corruption in one form or another is a primary cause in the collapse of

civilisations and an anathema to Islamic values as it is also accompanied by

large disparities in incomes and wealth, the harsh implementation of government

In the matter of responses to the highly personal questions on the Acts of

Worship, key issues regarding data reliability would include, rst, whether

the interviewee properly understood the question, and second, whether the

interviewee would be embarrassed to admit that he or she does not pray ve

times daily or complete other religious obligations, and consequently answers

incorrectly in the afrmative to these questions. The participation rates could

well be lower than indicated from the surveys.

It should be acknowledged that in the Islamic faith it is believed God judges

each act of worship on both the sincerity (ikhlas) and the quality (i.e., done

correctly according to qhi rules) of the Acts of worship performed by the Muslim.

The survey does not in any way address this quality, only the quantity of Acts

of Worship practices. Societal ills would be expected to be lower in countries

scoring higher in religiosity if the quality of the Acts of Worship is also high. This

is because the true value of all deeds is dependent on the sincerity of the person

doing them, which cannot be ascertained in such a survey. Yet acts normally do

originate in intention, and one assumes the right intention lies behind the Acts of

worship recorded in the surveys.

Acts of Worship or Personal Religiosity (Islamicity)

Table 2 shows that Afghanistan and the West African MMCs display the highest

attachment to Acts of Worship or Personal Islamicity, followed by the Southeast

Asian countries, South Asian countries, then the Middle Eastern countries and

Turkey, and nally the former Communist bloc members in Central Asia and

Southern Europe who display the lowest Islamicity levels. The low level of

Personal Religiosity identied for Kazakhstan is in line with the similar nding

of Riaz Hassan,33 who found among Muslims interviewed from seven Muslim-

majority countries that Kazakhstan had the lowest level of Ummah-consciousness

in terms of following standard Islamic beliefs and practices. Hassan believed this

was due to the fact that the Kazak Muslim identity is based more on ethnicity and

history rather than religiosity.

Table 3 shows that most of the 47 Muslim majority countries surveyed in terms

of indicators of Social Interactions congregate in specic zones of geographic,

political, or cultural similarity, which display closely similar levels of well-being

(best well-being on top, then reducing below):

• Gulf Arab countries and Brunei (‘Oil Shaykhdoms’)

• Malaysia, Indonesia; Kazakhstan and Tajikistan

nature (as for the IIW), include the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), the United

Nations’ Human Development Index, the Index of Social Health, the Index

of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW), and the Index of Economic Well-

being. Most but not all emphasise human and social factors related to economic

productivity. This writer looked at these indices to ascertain whether any of their

components deserve inclusion within the IIW. Additional well-being parameters

that may in future be assessed would be the status of the disabled as well as

elderly citizens, though it is believed statistics on performance levels in these two

sectors are not currently available across many MMCs.

In preparing this assessment, consideration has been given rst to the validity

of the statistical data used and secondly to the validity of the methodology

used, including such matters as the selection of the parameters, selection of the

indicator to represent each parameter, and then the weighting of the parameters.

The approach taken here could be subject to review and improvement in future

exercises of this nature. Data has been obtained from various sources including

the United Nations, World Bank and the Pew Research Center on the basis that

all data has been properly validated and is therefore reliable. Many of the well-

being indicators used in the current assessment such as mortality rates, income

disparity levels, and education indicators are also used by the United Nations and

World Bank to evaluate the development needs of developing countries. There

could be some concern regarding some of the data sources as to possible political

bias against Muslim countries in their output.31

Questions could be asked about the accuracy of the Pew Research Center

data32 or how representative it is of the Muslim population as a whole. Although

it is based on 38,000 face-to-face interviews in more than 80 languages, in some

instances areas with high levels of insecurity or limited access were excluded

from the national survey, which could have had some impact on the reliability of

data, for example from Afghanistan. Pew Center reported “with 95% condence

that the error attributable to collecting data from some, rather than all, members of

the Muslim populations is plus or minus the margin of error”. The margin of error

for the countries sampled was less than 5.6 points, except in Iraq (5.8 points),

Lebanon (6.1 points), Palestinian Territories (6.3 points), and Turkey (5.8 points).

In some countries the achieved sampling suffered some gender bias with more

women being sampled in Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan and more men sampled in

Afghanistan and Niger. Also there may have been some overrepresentation of

highly educated respondents in Albania, the Palestinian Territories, Tajikistan

Gini income inequality indices of 27.8, 30.9 and 30.0, respectively, virtually the

lowest among MMCs. To avoid giving an undeserved well-being “reward” for

war-torn countries, these countries were marked down to an average Gini value

when calculating the overall result for Social Interactions.

For education to secondary level, best ranking countries are those among the

former Soviet bloc, Qatar and Maldives, while the least are in West Africa.

Regarding the rst indicator for women’s status, female to male secondary

education, Qatar, Brunei, Kuwait, Syria and Libya have the highest rates of

female secondary education attendance (female/male ratios above 1.00). This is

somewhat skewed towards women’s education in some cases (especially Libya

1.26 and Kuwait 1.19!), which may not necessarily be benecial for society.34

However, the situation where a larger proportion of women is educated than

men is similar to that found in most OECD countries.35 Very low ratios are

exhibited by the West African countries (especially 0.29 for Burkina Faso) and

Yemen (0.31), while Afghanistan unsurprisingly is the lowest (0.17). The Gulf

Countries and Brunei exhibit the lowest maternal mortality rates while the worst

rates are in West Africa and the Horn of Africa. From the criteria assessed, the

condition of women would seem to be poorest in Afghanistan, Chad, Mali, Niger,

Nigeria and Sierra Leone.

Divorce rates are low in Yemen, Libya, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Indonesia.

They are especially high in the Maldives, Kazakhstan and Jordan. The other

indicator for care of children is infant mortality rates, which are low in the Gulf

countries and Brunei but high in East and West Africa and Afghanistan.

It is has been found consistently that in countries where adult literacy and

female to male ratios for secondary education are high, infant and maternal

mortality rates are low. Low adult literacy and female secondary education in

countries are however directly correlated with high infant and maternal mortality

rates. This would suggest the importance of education, especially for females,

in obtaining good health outcomes for infants and women giving birth. Both

under-5-year child and maternal mortality rates are extremely high in all sub-

Saharan African countries. As an example, in Nigeria, it has been estimated

that one million women and children die every year from largely preventable

causes. Most of the childhood deaths are due to polio, malaria, measles, bacterial

meningitis and malnutrition.36

War seems to be a great leveller in terms of economic income since when

an economy is devastated, wealth differentials reduce. This is one reading of

the fact that war-torn countries, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Somalia, all show low

that display the highest levels of Personal Religiosity at the same time demonstrate

the lowest levels of Social Interactions, as reected in the chosen parameters

of this study. This nding indicates that countries with Muslim citizens who

perform well in terms of Islamicity do not necessarily display good levels of

Social Interaction practices. This is an important nding that deserves follow-up

research to elucidate the reasons for this dissonance.

World averages for each Social Interaction criterion were determined to show

how MMCs stand through a global comparison (refer to Table 4). Since each

parameter is an index of well-being, it might be expected that Muslim countries

should lead worldwide in each of these elds. If they do not, then this would be

a clear indicator of how much improvement is required for the MMCs to attain

levels of excellence that could be recognised as truly Islamic.

Other factors of Social Interaction could be taken into account: for example,

rates of homicide, rape, and theft, which are all an anathema to societal well-

being. However, one could argue that these are secondary effects that are derived

from the primary causes of well-being which have already been incorporated

in the assessment. For example, social scientists have identied a common link

between a country’s high divorce rate and incidences of homicides and rape.

Apart from these countries, the lowest income inequality exists in some

of the Gulf countries, while the highest Gini inequality occurs in Comoros,

Malaysia, Qatar, Lebanon, Gambia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria. Signicant gender

differences in secondary education often correspond to countries with large

income inequalities. For example, low female/male ratios of secondary education

occur with high Gini income inequalities (respectively) in Burkina Faso (0.29,

39.8), Yemen (0.31, 37.7), Chad (0.34, 39.8) and Nigeria (0.35, 48.8).

Corruption is a major problem in Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, Libya, Uzbekistan,

Turkmenistan and the Horn of Africa. The Gulf countries, Brunei, Malaysia and

Jordan are perceived as having relatively low corruption levels. It is an anomaly

that Afghanistan with the highest rating for Personal Religiosity has one of the

worst levels of corruption. This is probably a consequence there of the precarious

living conditions and lack of political stability over the past 30 years of continuous

Discussion and Conclusions

Acts of Worship or Personal Religiosity (Islamicity)

The results show that Communism with its overt atheism and extreme

materialism has had the most severe negative impact on Islamicity as evidenced

from its effect on Muslim peoples who have in the past come under the Soviet

(and Chinese Communist) yoke. Harsh Kemalist secularism in Turkey was also

highly detrimental but is being gradually reversed. In both cases, governments

had discouraged and even penalised public worship, and the experience is so

recent that this discouragement has not been overcome. The negative impact of

Arab secular nationalistic regimes allied with the Soviet bloc in the cold-war era

can be seen in the relatively reduced Personal Religiosity levels evidenced in the

Middle Eastern countries (the “heart” of Islam) surveyed. One researcher blamed

that group who became rich under a non-Islamic economic system “because of

their greed, exploitation and stinginess” in not considering their duties to help the

poor and in their estrangement from Allah’s guidance and saw this as a factor that

enabled leftist regimes to spread their ideology in Muslim lands.37 By comparison,

it could be stated that some other parts of the Muslim world formerly colonised

by European countries seem to have withstood western secularist ideology and

cultural globalisation better in maintaining and now rejuvenating their Islamic

The most surprising and signicant nding of the present study is that the West

African bloc of countries (Nigeria, Chad, Senegal, Niger, Mali) and Afghanistan

ISLAM AND CIVILISATIONAL RENEWAL ICR 4.2 Produced and distributed by IAIS Malaysia

National independence is one additional Social Interaction parameter that

deserves to be incorporated within the well-being assessment but has not been,

due to a lack of information and a reliable means of assessing its status. If the

well-being of a Muslim country is dependent on external players, then there is

certainly concern about the sustainability of a state’s long-term well-being when

it is dependent on the whims of outsiders. Afghanistan as an example has suffered

for centuries due to the interference in its affairs from outside powers. In this

respect, one indicator that could be considered in future assessments to represent

part of the well-being parameter “National Independence” is “net foreign debt per

capita”. This is on the basis that if the country is indebted to bodies such as the

International Monetary Fund or The World Bank, the control these institutions

exercise over a country’s economy can severely reduce a nation’s freedom of

action, which in turn has an impact on the living conditions of its citizens.

Islamic Index of Well-being (IIW)

Table 5 shows that many countries in zones of geographic, political, or cultural

similarity are closely placed in the same band of well-being condition (best well-

being on top, then reducing below):

• Southeast Asian countries (Malaysia, Indonesia)

• Occupied countries (Afghanistan, Palestine)

• Middle Eastern countries

• West African countries and Frontline states (Pakistan, Lebanon)

• Former communist bloc countries in Central Asia and Southern Europe.

Of the 27 countries for which largely complete sets of both Personal Islamicity

and Social Interaction data are available, Malaysia and Indonesia hold the top

two places and clearly lead all others in having much higher overall well-

being scores (7.5 and 7.3, respectively, compared to next highest of 6.9). This

result was observed only after all the data had been calculated on an objective

and dispassionate basis, and no parameters were chosen to try to steer a result

favourable to these countries (in the region where this writer is based). It is a

positive outcome that Indonesia, the most populous Muslim country (2010

population: 233 million), is second while another populous country, Bangladesh

(2010 population: 164 million), is fth. These are both countries that have

experienced major and frequent natural disasters—the 2004 tsunami resulted

in the largest number of fatalities worldwide—which could represent divine

messages that the respective countries’ populations have responded to positively.

In regard to the impressive achievement of Malaysia, this was acknowledged

recently in published extracts from a letter to the Malaysian Prime Minister Najib

Tun Razak by the highly regarded scholar Shaykh Yusuf Al-Qaradawi, who

opined that “Malaysia has been distinguished among Muslim countries with its

impressive development strategy and openness, evolving as a referential centre

and model for the Muslim world.”38 A number of possible reasons for the positive

well-being condition of Southeast Asian Muslim countries could be suggested:

the relatively soft approach towards Islamisation used historically39; the

substantial role of Muslim women in these societies; the lack of destructive wars

in the region; the benet provided from the Asian economic “miracle” in building

strong economies accompanied by the appropriate allocation of public funds to

enhance education, health and welfare; and the transformation in Indonesia from

military rule to a functioning system of representative governance.
