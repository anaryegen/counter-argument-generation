Other hate crime based on religion or belief

Bias against individuals on the basis of religion or belief can take various forms. The extent and nature of attacks motivated by bias against a particular religion or belief are influenced by a number of factors, including the minority or majority status in a given territory, the level of recognition of particular religious or belief groups in a given country, or political and media focus on these groups at a particular moment. This category also presents hate crimes targeting non-believers.
