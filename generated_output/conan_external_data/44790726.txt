How ‘Monolithic’ is Islam?

Dr. theol. Michael I. Muluk·

Whenever Islamic radicals carry out a terrorist attack and I condemn the underlying ideology of Islam that drives people to carry out these barbaric atrocities, there are always people who kindly remind me that Islam is not a monolithic belief. People who tell me this are usually highly educated academics from both sides of the fence who have mostly experienced Islam from the pages of written books of various scholars. And, don’t get me wrong, I wholeheartedly agree with these people. After all, how can a faith that includes 1.6 billion people spread around the whole planet agree on every single of the doctrines of Islam? I would even go so far to say that every Muslim household practices tiny differences in their daily rituals. For example, being Turks, the women in my parent’s family don’t wear the Hijab, while the women of the Palestinian family next door do. Islam, like any other religion, has been undoubtedly enriched and modified by different cultures and conditions over the ages, to become the tapestry of beliefs and rituals that we have now.

But how different is Islam being practiced by one group of people to the other? I think this is what is sometimes blown out of proportion by academics and apologists alike. I have even heard several scholars claim that we cannot talk about Islamic beliefs since Islam is just too diverse to discuss as a single group! Of course, that is total nonsense! As a former Sunni from Germany with a Turkish background, I have led communal prayers here in Munich, but also in Cairo, Istanbul, Mecca, Kuala Lumpur, and Jakarta. Every single person in each of my congregations knew the surahs from the Qur’an that I was reciting. Nobody ever complained! As a Muslim, you literally can drop by any Mosque on the planet and take part in the prayers there. You will feel right at home. Imams anywhere in this world will recite from the same Qur’an the same Surah al-Fatihah followed by other popular verses from Allah’s book. Every single one of the 1.6 billion Muslims in the world do their mandatory prayers in Arabic. Translations of the Qur’an are not valid ‘recitals’ for prayers! That should be enough to debunk this alleged diversity in Islamic rituals that exist in this world. Deviations certainly exist. But the degree of how much these deviations modify Islam is mostly exaggerated.

The situation in Islam is probably comparable to what happens in Christianity. For example, while the rites of Catholics and Protestants are quite different from one another, I have yet to see a Christian denomination that believes that Christ taught to hate one’s neighbor. Or I have yet to encounter a Christian sect that believes that Jesus was a Roman Soldier. While Christianity is practiced by many denominations, some, if not most, of the key tenets of Christianity work across denominations.

The same can be said about Islam. While Muslims have a similar schism inside the Ummah — the great Sunni vs. Shia divide — , globally, Islam agrees on most of its practices and teachings. For example, all Muslims pray five times each day, all facing Mecca. Every Muslim agrees that Muhammad was leading armies from the front. All Muslims agree that Jesus is not God. All Muslim women admit that their religion teaches them to cover up their body to a certain degree to maintain their modesty. On the other hand, I have yet to encounter an Islamic sect that goes on the Hajj to Jerusalem or a Mosque that faces to the North Pole.

Even the differences between Sunni and Shia are not as vast as some scholars want you to believe. After all, both groups share the same holy book, which for both Sunni and Shia is the unerring word of Allah. There is no Sunni Qur’an or Shia Qur’an. The same goes for armed Jihad. We have Sunni groups which apparently believe that it is Allah’s will to blow-up the infidel wherever they can be found: Al-Qaeda, ISIS, Al-Nusra, Abu Sayyaf. However, the same hate towards the infidel is also shared by Shia groups: Hezbollah, Anshar Allah, Al-Muntazir Brigade. All of these groups seem to share the belief that Islam is not a Religion of Peace.

So, while Islam is indeed not a monolithic group, we have to be able to keep in perspective how much Islamic practice and belief deviates from one sect to the other. In my upcoming books, I will give you plenty of examples of how I experienced Islam in different parts of the globe. And I am confident that you can make up your own informed picture of Islam, and how monolithic or diverse Islam really is.
