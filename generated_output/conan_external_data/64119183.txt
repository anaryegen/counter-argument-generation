Ethnic diversity makes Britain’s culture great. It would be a disaster if we lost it

Figures show nearly 40% of our top cultural figures come from migrant or minority ethnic backgrounds – but barriers still exist

A couple of weeks ago, a young black man from south London stood up in front of tens of thousands of people and delivered one of the most celebrated performances in the history of Glastonbury. A few days later, an England cricket squad – almost half of whom were born abroad or are from an ethnic minority background – made it into the semi-finals of the World Cup. Meanwhile over at Tate Modern, a British artist of Nigerian origin is displaying an artwork made up of thousands of books imprinted with the names of migrants who have made significant contributions to British culture.

Today, some of our most brilliant prospects in art and culture are from minority ethnic or migrant backgrounds. We present a gloriously multicultural face to the world. And that is important not just for the story we tell to others, but for the stories we tell ourselves. Think of the cultural power of the first Asian families on EastEnders, the breakthrough of Soul II Soul in the 1980s, or the nation-defining literary output of Zadie Smith.

The British actor Riz Ahmed refers to this as “stretching the flag, so it’s big enough to embrace all of us”. He is talking about how art can remould how we see ourselves and the country that we live in. The Pakistani-British heritage of his youth is just as much a part of our modern national story as the playing fields of Eton, remote Shetland communities or the multi-ethnic melting pots of Leicester, Birmingham and London. But it is only through the representation of that experience in our national culture that those truths are cemented across the whole country.

We should be confident and proud about this story – yet it is too rarely told.

Now a report from Global Future does exactly that, demonstrating not only the increasing diversity of our cultural industries, but how popular that diversity is. According to the report, nearly 40% of our leading cultural figures are from migrant or minority ethnic backgrounds. In other words, diversity is making an outsized contribution to British culture. And the size of the contribution is going up all the time: five years ago it was less than a third.

Global Future’s survey of 2,000 UK adults suggests nearly seven in 10 of us agree that diversity has improved our culture, against 15% who disagree. Food, music and sport are the cultural industries where people believe diversity has had the greatest impact.

This is music to my ears, of course. Britain is my home. I was born here, I have lived my whole life here, and I have pursued my life’s passion here. As a dancer, Britain has been my stage.

It is our culture that makes me most proud to be British. That same culture has been a welcoming home for my own work: where a British dancer of Bangladeshi origin can pursue a career blending the Indian kathak style with contemporary forms. This openness to diversity is visible in many arenas: just look at the Notting Hill carnival every year. Or take the Turner prize, where the artists shortlisted in the last two years have been of German, Fijian, Israeli, Zanzibari, Palestinian, Jamaican and Bengali heritage.

Diversity is what makes Britain’s culture great. But recently it has felt as though we have lost sight of this self-evident truth. Brexit, polarisation and the poisonous debate about immigration threaten to turn our diversity into division. That would be a historic disaster for the country.

And yet when it comes to our culture, we are not really divided at all. We are united in our admiration for the acting of Idris Elba, the athleticism of Jessica Ennis-Hill and the artistry of Anish Kapoor and many more. It is essential that we remind ourselves of that fact, at a time when our politics seems geared towards making us forget it.

We can – and should – always do more. There are still serious barriers to entry for people of a minority ethnic background into our major cultural industries. In some cases, exclusivity in the arts is increasing rather than decreasing. Our culture should be ours collectively, not reserved for a few – and we have to work tirelessly to make sure that is the case.

But let’s never lose sight of what makes Britain so special. Our differences fuel our creativity. And our exposure to all the cultures of the world does nothing but improve our own.
