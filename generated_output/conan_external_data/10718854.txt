Religion is a disease

It is a disease that takes over the mind, and prevents critical thinking. It brainwashs the believer into a submissive and reluctant behavior. It makes the individual think that outside information is false, regardless of facts and evidence. It makes the individual feel superior to others because of the religious righteousness that has been woven into their core. It provides the individual with a false sense of hope and trust from the like-minded. The disease feeds on the children to prevent starvation, so that the next generation can be indoctrinated to start the same process over and over...and unfortunately there is no cure unless you stop the process before it begins.

We all know it‚Äôs no secret it‚Äôs a disease, its still surprising how some people even today believe in fantasies like religion‚Ä¶

religion is a threat to humanity.

Additional_Bluebird9

Same here, with so much wonder in the world and the universe, I'm even perplexed that people subscribe to such beliefs and practices for a majority of their lives.

It's because the churches get them young and brainwash them.

This is exactly right.

Or maybe, if God is everywhere, where the fuck is he?

That‚Äôs not a answer. You can‚Äôt just say God is eternal and without origin, without proving a God even exists and without proving something can even be beyond our reality. You can‚Äôt even prove there is an ‚Äúoutside‚Äù where your supposed conscious entity dictates the laws of our material Universe. Now, let‚Äôs say you somehow prove God scientifically, how do you know it‚Äôs your God? And the Bible isn‚Äôt a credible science text so don‚Äôt go using that collection of Bronze Age legends.

Honestly religion itself isn't the issue. Nothing is wrong with hope and temporary solutions. It's when cognitive dissonance and being irrational come into play.

Religion is built on a foundation of cognitive dissonance and irrationality. It teaches these as a worldview. Religion is the catalyst that causes an inability to use critical thinking skills. Religion is most definitely the issue.

I'm not sure I agree. I think it has the do with the "teachers". Growing up, I was taught to question everything - the Bible, the preacher, God, yourself - no one was spared. I do agree the masses are muppeted into believing b/c the word is law and thus why this thread exists. But if more people actively thought about it and literally didn't drink the Kool-Aid it would be a different story.

But that's not the case, so circular argument. I'm out.

So your rebuttal is, ‚ÄúI know you are but what am I?‚Äù

Good point, I always considered it as a used single-use battery. It was necessary but now it's useless and needs to be "recycled" So much resources, money, space, time, personnel was put into religion and never retrieved

To be fair it is likely a huge reason why humanity has gottten to the point it‚Äôs at now as quickly as it has. I more than agree it has outlived its utility.

I think we would've surpassed this point long ago if not for religion holding us back.

Religion has historically endowed some populations certain competitive advantages over other populations.

Perhaps the greatest threat is people like you as well as those authoritarian regimes who use many different ways to justify awful things. Those things didn‚Äôt happen cause of lack of religion, it was cause they put psychopaths in charge as does the GOP, Mormons, etc. So go fuckin whining back to the Book of Mormon . One thing the USSR and religious countries have in common though is that both of there people wanted more either to believe in or to eat.

Also can we all just agree to report him and get him blocked.

Need to organize a PAC to lobby atheism and protect this country

TraditionalEagle5169

This is the single best idea I've read today. We want freedom FROM religion not forced accommodation TO religion. It seems we need to start lobbying for taxing churches as the corporations they are, GOP wants to bitch about deficits let's fix em

You son of a bitch, I'm in!

Critical-Shoulder873

Would that be FFRF? Just joined it, encouraged by your comment.

Being atheist has to be profitable first and foremost. All best PACs are about helping one group make more money of another. Unfortunately atheism doesn‚Äôt have a tithe.

I grew up very religious and when i became of age to be baptized i said no and started studying other religions to find the right one for me. During my studies i came across atheism and it all became clear. Now I‚Äôve successfully turned most of my siblings away from religion. I know others my age whove done the same. The world is growing out of its old archaic ways, very very slowly, but we‚Äôll get there.

Aggravating_Day_2744

Critical thinking at work. Good for you, congrats üéâ

I don't believe it is a metaphor. It's literally "believing" in monsters and invisible men with superpowers. That sounds like straight-up mental illness.

My dad believes in a literal "spiritual war" going on everywhere around us that we just can't see. If he were to find out when we were younger that you watched a "bad" movie or a "bad" song he'd get so pissed and talk about how we were bringing evil spirits into the house.

Even worse, today he leaves Christian music on all night to attempt to drive off the evil spirits.

Real problem is that it makes people feel good, however perverse or diseased you may think that is, it is true. My mother enjoyed putting herself up on a cross whenever posssible because she was brought up with ultra modesty of the lace curtain Irish. If you want to talk about disease you'll find it most prevelant among the Irsish Catholics. Above my parent's bed was a picture of the bleeding heart of Jesus. For hundreds of years everytime the Irsih would try to rise up, the clergy would convince them that the meek shaall inherit the earth. What rot. The Brittish weren't worst eenmy, It was the church.

Do I sound bitter, that's because I"m exceedingly bitter.

It definitely is a disease. It takes over the mind, heart, and soul of a person, but not in a beautiful, peaceful, loving way.

(I met my husband on a dating website. One of the reasons I replied to him was that his profile said "Religion is a disease that should be eradicated.")

It's also archaic barbaric and un fit for the modern world

This subreddit os so refreshing. And the post is soooo to the point. I am an anti-theist now, I longer just say I am an atheist.

Sir, how about you go ahead and get a library membership so that you can get books to read? If you start using your critical faculties, I promise your juvenille tendencies to make snarky, off-the-cuff remarks will undoubtedly subside.

I have two texts you wrote in this post, and that provides me with statistically significant evidence about your intellectual maturity. Think long and hard how stupifyingly ignorant you must be for such a conclusion to be drawn from so little evidence. The light's are on, but nobody's home.

Anti-theism isn't hateful in the slightest, it is the challenging of dogmatic thinking and the promotion of skepticism.

More replies More replies More replies

Yes. It‚Äôs even worse when you have to watch your own parents and siblings mindlessly go to church every Sunday and use it to justify their hate towards trans, lgbtqia, non-white, and other religions.

Aggravating_Day_2744

Yes religion is so full of hate.

It's a disease which, upon infection, causes the infected person to try to spread the disease.

So basically, it's a virus.

Aggravating_Day_2744

Damn near a zombie virus...except its victims have a distaste for functioning brains...

You missed the most heinous part of it all - it's fine if someone believes in nonsense, it doesn't affect me. But religion is used as a tool of control by others. It's a lever of power, and scrupulous people never are at the helm. So then you have stuff like the Inquisition and the Crusades before you know it.

Religion is a pathway to power, and a means to fulfill humanity's darkest and most brutal urges.

Nah, the Crusades example aint it.

It's essentially a computer virus

Worse: it‚Äôs a computer virus that evolves. Regular computer viruses can‚Äôt evolve because random mutations in a computer virus have very little probability of doing anything but crash the program (code is fragile).

Mind viruses, however, don‚Äôt have that problem. They will mutate as to fit their environment, and evolve to spread as much as possible.

Aggravating_Day_2744

As Richard Dawkins puts it, a brain virus.

Surprised no one has pointed out this is the literal plot of Snow Crash

There is a cure. It's called objectively reading whatever holy book and the history surrounding it. Much like the COVID-19 vaccine, though, you can't convince these idiots to take it.

Mark Twain famously said the best cure for Christianity is reading the Bible.

Aggravating_Day_2744

But they don't, they just take the bits they like.

As I‚Äôve said before‚Ä¶ either the Bible is the inspired word of God and you have to take it all, or your faith is based on your personal preferences and biases which means it‚Äôs not really faith at all, it‚Äôs cherry picked self justification.

Shockingly this is the common way most people take most religions. /s

My father was sent to a christian school in the 1920s because his mother thought he'd be safer there after the Spanish Flu had killed so many. Unreligious his whole life, he finally got a chance to read the Buy-Bull after he retired.

His conclusion? 'GOD IS A LUNATIC!'

Yes, the cure is the George Soros funded vaccine that us deep state endorsed atheist leftists put in children that implants a microchip to subvert everyone‚Äôs minds to Satan.

I'd be less inclined to distance myself from them if they were just deists. Have that personal belief, with no damaging indoctrination that I know of. Religion has always been unnecessary

Any objective look at it would have to conclude that it's a mental illness.

Broad_Engineering899

It's more like mold or maybe fungus.

Religion is a disease indeed. It is very dangerous and will get worse as time goes on. The hatred they spew upon others is disgusting, and it makes me sick to my stomach, knowing that they go to bed at night feeling so proud they are better than everyone else. I will go as far as saying that religion is an evil disease!!!

Aggravating_Day_2744

Definitely evil in all its forms.

It just saddens me that it made so many people in the USA really vulnerable to scum like the GOP.

Seriously, nothing gets done except a bit of drama, Americans are being fucked over six ways from Sunday, they're looking at cutting social safety nets by calling them "woke", it's just...so obvious and yet the voter base still doesn't get it. Why?

Everything you just said.

Aggravating_Day_2744

Unfortunately they have dumbed down the society and taken logic, reason and science out of schools and replaced it with the imaginary sky daddy.

‚ÄúThink of how stupid the average person is, and realize half of them are stupider than that.‚Äù

Education is power. Science is awesome :)

The worst part of my entire life was realising how so many people could be so stupid, and this extends beyond religion itself as well.

It‚Äôs poison to society

Same with Conservatism.

2 sides of the same coin

Both sides is known far right rhetoric trying to normalize Republican corruption. No one falls for this faux centrism propaganda...

Religion has a difficult time determining WHAT God wants - It is usually tainted by leaders or power brokers political agendas. It's only after the fever has subsided whan we discover that God had no say whatsoever in the political agendas of people thirsting for power!

100% agree!!! I was raised pentecostal, and looking back I'm certain that is what caused a huge amount of anxiety and self judgement, that curses me to this day.

Totally agree. There are 3 books I challenge any Christian willing to actually seek truth to read: Outgrowing God, God is Not Great, and The God Delusion. These books are great at getting more educated Christians to think about their religion from an outside view with only an antagonistic tone toward the horrors of god but not the followers themselves. Some Christians though frankly are just too indoctrinated, uneducated, or lack reasoning skills to really be helped. They were vulnerable to the false message from the beginning and unless you can get someone they view as authoritative like a brother, sister, or close friend to come across the aisle they have no chance of putting the pieces together themselves.

Aggravating_Bobcat33

Those are great books, definitely reinforcing our atheist perspective. I wonder how many are actually persuaded by them? Indoctrination of religion into youth is a very powerful weapon wielded by religions. it is very "sticky" with young minds.
