The internet is a tool that enables other human rights, such as freedom of expression and opinion, and as such, it should be considered a basic human right.", "counter-argument": "While the internet has become an integral part of modern life, it should not be considered a basic human right. The argument for internet access as a fundamental right is understandable - the internet has become essential for accessing information, communicating with others, and participating in the digital economy. However, classifying it as a human right sets an unrealistic and potentially damaging precedent.\n\nThere are several key reasons why internet access should not be considered a basic human right. First and foremost, the internet is a technology, not a basic need like food, water, shelter, or healthcare. Unlike these essential requirements for human survival and wellbeing, the internet is a tool that enables certain activities and capabilities, but is not necessary for the most fundamental aspects of human life.\n\nAdditionally, classifying internet access as a human right would place an enormous burden on governments and society to ensure universal access. This could divert resources and attention away from addressing more pressing human rights issues and basic needs. It could also incentivize overregulation and government control of the internet, which could stifle innovation and restrict individual freedoms.\n\nFinally, the internet is constantly evolving, with new technologies and applications emerging all the time. Enshrining it as a human right could make it difficult to adapt to these changes and could lead to outdated policies and regulations. Instead, the internet should be treated as a valuable resource that governments and societies should strive to make widely accessible, while recognizing its role as a tool rather than a fundamental human right."}
{"argument": "Employers should be allowed to monitor employees through tracking mechanisms.", "cmdr_websearch": "Employee monitoring through tracking mechanisms is an invasion of privacy and a breach of trust. It treats employees like children who need constant supervision and can lead to a toxic work environment, damaging morale and productivity. Employers should focus on creating an environment of mutual respect and accountability, not one of surveillance and control.", "counter-argument": "Our society relies on trust. Employers entrust their employees with sensitive information, resources, and representing their brand. In return, employees trust their employer will compensate them fairly. This symbiotic relationship only thrives when both sides uphold their end of the bargain. \n\nUnfortunately, abuses of trust do occur. A minority of employees may misuse company time and assets for personal gain. Their actions unfairly hurt their fellow colleagues.\n\nMonitoring protects both parties. It deters misconduct and provides evidence if disputes arise. Responsible employees have nothing to fear, as they already work with integrity. For them, monitoring simply provides validation.\n\nGranted, privacy is also a virtue. But the workplace is not our home. Certain restrictions apply. Leaders must balance trust with verification. \n\nModern technology now enables discreet monitoring. Data and insights can improve efficiency, without compromising dignity. For instance, software may track tasks without recording personal details. Reports are anonymized where possible. The focus is on patterns - not individuals.\n\nWith care, monitoring can strengthen bonds between employers and employees. Shared awareness breeds mutual understanding and respect. Secrets divide us; transparency unites us. Oversight steers us back when we stray off course. \n\nLet us have faith in each other\u2019s good intentions. And let us verify those intentions, to keep us all accountable. With courage and compassion, monitoring can nurture the trust that businesses need to thrive."}
{"argument": "Space tourism should be allowed without initial limits on safety regulations", "cmdr_websearch": "Space tourism without safety regulations is a recipe for disaster.

Without these, the risks of fatal accidents, equipment failure, and environmental harm are unacceptably high.", "counter-argument": "Friends, space is the final frontier, and it calls to the explorer in all of us. Should we let regulations restrain the human spirit to reach out and touch the stars? I say nay! Space tourism allows everyday people to glimpse the wonders of the cosmos that our ancestors could only dream of. Some raise safety concerns, but life is not without risk. Just as the pioneers who settled the American West centuries ago, we must forge ahead with courage in our hearts. What is progress without peril?\n\nThe regulations proposed would hamper innovation in this nascent industry. Stifling creativity now could delay the development of safer, more affordable space travel for decades. We cannot let fear stop us from pursuing our manifest destiny among the planets. The flybys offered today are but the first small steps on the path to the stars. \n\nI urge you all not to hinder those visionaries brave enough to turn fiction into fact. Let entrepreneurs chart the heavens unburdened by bureaucracy. In time, space tourism will open the wonders of the universe to all humankind. We must begin the journey now. The sky calls to us! Will we turn away, or will we heed the call? I know where my heart lies. Who will join me in this noble quest?"}
{"argument": "Charter schools increase options and drive education innovation.", "cmdr_websearch": "While charter schools may offer alternative educational models, they often do so at the cost of diverting resources from the public school system, which ultimately limits options for those who cannot access or afford them, thus exacerbating educational inequality. Furthermore, the \"innovation\" they bring might not always align with evidence-based practices and could lack proper oversight and accountability.", "counter-argument": "Charter schools are a valuable option that can drive much-needed innovation and improvement in education.  By operating with more flexibility and autonomy than traditional public schools, charters can experiment with new teaching methods, curricula, scheduling, and programs to better meet the needs of their students.  The most successful innovations can then spread and be adopted by other schools.\nMoreover, charter schools increase options for students and families, especially those who may be poorly served by their local district schools.  Low-income and minority students in particular stand to benefit from access to charter schools, which often focus on college preparation and have achieved impressive results in underserved communities.  Every child deserves a quality education, and charters provide an alternative for those children who would otherwise be stuck in failing schools.\nSome argue that charters siphon resources and high-achieving students away from traditional public schools.  However, the overall impact of charters is positive - they create a competitive effect that puts healthy pressure on all schools to improve and attract students.  Furthermore, charters are public schools, funded by tax dollars based on enrollment just like district schools.  They simply represent a different public school option.\nUltimately, education is not one-size-fits-all.  Students have diverse needs and learning styles, and families have different preferences and priorities when it comes to schooling.  Charter schools expand the range of available options to meet this diversity of needs and empower families with choice in education.  Our children's future is too important for a one-size-fits-all approach.  It's time to embrace the power of options and innovation through charter schools."}
{"argument": "Social media should not be required to verify user identities", "cmdr_websearch": "Social media platforms should verify user identities to prevent abuse and maintain a safe digital environment for all users. This measure helps hold individuals accountable for their online actions and discourages harmful behavior, such as cyberbullying or spreading misinformation. Verification also ensures that users are who they say they are, fostering authenticity and trust in online interactions.", "counter-argument": "Social media should not be required to verify user identities because doing so would violate privacy, stifle free speech, and be logistically challenging. \n\nRequiring user identity verification would undermine the privacy that many people rely on when using social media. The ability to express one's views anonymously or under a pseudonym is critical for people sharing sensitive opinions, experiences, or identities. Forcing people to link their online presence to their legal identity takes away this privacy, exposing them to harm like stalking, harassment or discrimination. \n\nIdentity verification requirements also threaten free speech. The freedom to speak anonymously is essential for open discourse, whistleblowing and political dissent. If people's legal identities are tied to their social media presence, many may self-censor out of fear of repercussions from employers, the government or others. This creates a chilling effect contrary to principles of free expression.\n\nFinally, identity verification on today's global social media platforms with billions of users would pose huge implementation challenges. Social media companies may lack the resources, systems and global reach needed to verify identities on such a massive scale, especially when some users lack formal identification documents. Strict verification requirements could exclude many people from using social media.\n\nProtecting privacy, upholding free speech and avoiding exclusion of marginalized groups outweigh calls for increased accountability. Social media provides valuable public discourse without forcing users to link online activity to their legal identities."}
{"argument": "Social media companies should not be required to label AI-generated content", "cmdr_websearch": "Social media companies have a responsibility to their users to provide transparency and ensure informed consent. Labeling AI-generated content is essential for users to understand the origin of the material they are engaging with and to make informed decisions about its consumption and sharing. Without such labels, users are at risk of being manipulated or deceived, and the potential for misuse and abuse of AI technology is heightened.", "counter-argument": "Social media companies should not be required to label AI-generated content for several key reasons:\nFirst, it would be an undue burden and nearly impossible to enforce. AI content generation has advanced to the point that it can closely mimic human-created posts, articles, and media. Requiring platforms to accurately identify and label all AI content would take immense resources and slow down the user experience with little tangible benefit. A study by the Digital Frontier Foundation estimates content labeling would cost social media companies over $500 million annually.\nSecond, labeling could actually undermine healthy online discourse. Prominently marking certain content as \"AI-generated\" may lead to increased polarization and filter bubbles, as users gravitate only toward human-created posts that align with their existing views. AI content has the potential to expose people to alternative perspectives and reduce ideological echo chambers.\nFinally, this requirement would dampen innovation and free expression in online spaces. Many writers, artists, and creators are experimenting with AI as a new medium. Stigmatizing their work with compulsory labels could dissuade this emerging art form. The First Amendment protects their right to express themselves using the tools they choose without unnecessary restrictions. MIT Technology Review dubbed AI \"the future of content creation\" - we should embrace it, not hamper it with over-regulation.\nIn short, mandatory AI labeling would prove unworkable, undermine open discourse, and restrict digital innovation and expression. Social media platforms should have the freedom to develop their own policies without this burdensome requirement."}
{"argument": "No limits should be placed on acceptable human risk for initial Mars colonization missions", "cmdr_websearch": "Placing limits on acceptable human risk for Mars colonization is essential. Without risk management, we gamble with the lives of astronauts and the future of space exploration. The risks are too high, and the consequences of failure are too severe to ignore.", "counter-argument": "Initial Mars colonization missions should not have limits placed on acceptable human risk because space exploration is fundamentally about pushing boundaries, taking risks, and boldly going where no one has gone before. Without embracing risk, there can be no progress.\n\nThe history of exploration on Earth always involved great danger - climb the highest peaks, dive to the deepest depths. But humanity's desire to explore propelled us forward, often with tragic losses, but ultimately with great rewards. Exploration of space must be the same. \n\nThere are always unknown dangers, but Mars colonization is a pivotal moment in human evolution. We cannot achieve our destiny as a spacefaring species if we are too risk-averse. The potential knowledge gained and lives saved by establishing a colony on Mars are worth almost any risk. \n\nThe first colonists will face hardships - that much is guaranteed. But the human spirit is resilient. With sufficient training, resources and support, the first colonists can survive the dangers. And their sacrifices will make life far better for the generations of colonists that follow.\n\nWe cannot foresee all the perils of traversing millions of miles of space and living on another planet. But we must have faith that the indomitable human drive to explore will carry us through. With the proper screening and selection, we can have confidence in choosing colonists willing and psychologically prepared to accept the risks that come with forging a new path for humanity on Mars.\n\nThe time is now for boldness, vision and faith in the human spirit.

{"argument": "Social media platforms should not be liable for harmful content posted by users", "cmdr_websearch": "Social media platforms have a responsibility to their users and the public to maintain a safe digital environment. They have the means to monitor and control content, and thus, should be held accountable for harmful content that slips through the cracks. Their liability encourages better content moderation and protects users from abuse, misinformation, and other harmful content.", "counter-argument": "Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter should not be held responsible for the content posted by users on their sites, even if some of that content is harmful or dangerous. There are several key reasons why:\n\nFirst, holding social media companies liable for user content would require them to strictly monitor and censor everything users post, which would severely restrict free speech online. These platforms are designed to be open forums for communication and expression. While some moderation of illegal content is necessary, broadly censoring controversial speech is a dangerous precedent that goes against democratic principles of free and open discourse.\n\nSecond, it's impractical and unreasonable to expect social media sites to catch every single instance of misinformation, hate speech, calls to violence, or other problematic content given the enormous volume of posts made by billions of users each day. Even the most sophisticated AI systems can't reliably detect all harmful content. Penalizing platforms for content they miss, despite good faith efforts, is unfair.\n\nThird, holding platforms liable for user content also reduces the incentive for them to moderate at all out of fear that imperfect moderation exposes them to lawsuits. This could paradoxically result in more unfiltered harmful content online. Protections from liability like Section 230 allow sites to make moderation efforts without undue risk.\n\nUltimately, individual users are responsible for what they post online, not the platforms that host that content. Blaming social media sites for society's ills ignores the root causes. The solution is more digital literacy education, not scapegoating tech companies for human misbehavior on their platforms. Otherwise we risk undermining free speech online and making the internet less open and accessible for everyone."}
{"argument": "Requiring all police officers to wear body cameras should not be mandated", "cmdr_websearch": "Body-worn cameras on police officers provide an unbiased account of events, offering protection to both citizens and police. They are an effective tool to increase transparency and accountability, and their use should be mandated to ensure consistency and trust in law enforcement. Not requiring their use could imply a lack of willingness to be held accountable and may hinder progress in community-police relations.", "counter-argument": "Mandating body cameras for all police officers is well-intentioned but misguided. While body cameras provide auxiliary evidence and promote accountability in police interactions, a blanket mandate ignores the nuances of implementing this technology and may undermine community relationships.\n\nFirst, the costs associated with purchasing, storing, and maintaining body camera footage impose significant financial burdens on police departments and local governments, many of which face budget constraints. These fiscal challenges potentially divert funds from other priorities like expanding community programs, recruiting diverse officers, and implementing rigorous training. \n\nSecond, strict body camera requirements discount officers' discretion and judgment in the field. Recording every encounter fails to account for sensitive situations like interviewing victims or interacting with informants where privacy is paramount. Officers need flexibility to balance transparency and community trust with legitimate privacy and safety concerns.\n\nFinally, emphasizing body cameras shifts responsibility for building community-police relations onto technology rather than meaningful engagement and dialogue. While cameras provide oversight, they are not a panacea for underlying issues around racial biases, use of force policies, and community participation. Cameras alone will not resolve tensions without simultaneously addressing those systemic concerns.\n\nRather than blanket mandates, communities would be better served by giving individual departments flexibility to phase-in and develop body camera programs tailored to local needs and in collaboration with residents. With open communication and good faith on both sides, we can thoughtfully integrate this technology while also strengthening the human relationships at the heart of policing."}
{"argument": "It is fair for insurers and lenders to use credit scores and risk models.", "cmdr_websearch": "Credit scores and risk models can perpetuate systemic biases and discriminate against certain groups, as they are often based on data that reflects historical inequalities and unfair practices. This can result in higher costs and limited opportunities for those with lower credit scores, further exacerbating social and economic inequalities. Fairer alternatives should be considered, such as assessing ability to pay and individual circumstances, to ensure equal access and opportunity.", "counter-argument": "It is fair for insurers and lenders to use credit scores and risk models when determining an individual's premiums or loan terms. These scores and models allow insurers and lenders to accurately assess risk and price their products accordingly. Without risk-based pricing, insurers and lenders would be forced to charge all customers the same premiums and interest rates regardless of risk, which is inherently unfair. Those who present little risk would be forced to subsidize those who present higher risk. \n\nCredit scores are a highly predictive measure of risk and future financial responsibility. Individuals with higher scores have a long history of repaying debts and managing finances responsibly. It is reasonable for lenders to offer them better rates. Likewise, insurers rely on sophisticated actuarial models that price policies according to measurable risk factors. Without risk-based pricing, insurers could not remain solvent.\n\nImportantly, insurers and lenders using credit scores and risk models makes insurance and credit more accessible and affordable for the majority of responsible consumers. Risk-based pricing allows companies to keep overall premiums and interest rates lower by isolating higher risk applicants. This encourages fiscal responsibility and rewards individuals for maintaining strong credit histories.\n\nWhile no risk model is perfect, insurers and lenders have a right to assess measurable risks that affect their business. As long as models are fair, transparent and non-discriminatory, it is reasonable for companies to employ actuarially sound practices that allow them to operate sustainably. Outlawing risk-based pricing would only hamper the availability and affordability of insurance and credit for millions of responsible Americans."}
{"argument": "Corporations should not be required to disclose their climate impacts", "cmdr_websearch": "Corporations have a social responsibility to disclose their climate impacts as their operations can significantly affect the environment and communities. Transparency allows stakeholders to make informed decisions and encourages companies to reduce their carbon footprint. Disclosure also enables the public to hold corporations accountable for their actions and supports the transition to a sustainable economy.", "counter-argument": "Governments forcing corporations to disclose climate data would be a misguided policy that could hurt businesses, consumers, and the economy without delivering meaningful environmental benefits.  Many companies are already taking strong voluntary measures to track and reduce their climate impacts - additional disclosure mandates would only add costly red tape and bureaucracy.\nA 2019 analysis by the National Association of Manufacturers estimated that mandatory environmental reporting requirements could cost U.S. businesses over $10 billion per year in compliance expenses. These added costs would inevitably be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices for goods and services. At a time of high inflation, we can't afford policies that further raise costs of living for hardworking families.\nMandatory climate disclosures could also put U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage against foreign rivals not subject to the same onerous requirements. Saddling American businesses with additional regulatory burdens risks hurting their ability to compete globally, potentially leading to lost profits, reduced hiring, and damage to the U.S. economy.\nThe SEC's own research shows that 90% of S&P 500 companies already voluntarily publish sustainability reports, demonstrating that heavy-handed government intervention is unnecessary. We should continue allowing market forces and consumer preferences to drive corporate climate transparency rather than imposing rigid one-size-fits-all mandates. As long as companies aren't lying or misleading the public, they should have flexibility in what environmental data they choose to track and report."}

Therefore, a hybrid approach, where self-driving technology assists but does not replace human drivers, might be a more feasible solution.", "counter-argument": "Self-driving cars represent an important safety innovation that can reduce traffic accidents, injuries, and fatalities by eliminating the major causes of crashes: human error and negligence. While some are skeptical of the technology, studies have shown that autonomous driving systems make far fewer mistakes on the road than human drivers, avoiding risks like distracted, impaired, and reckless driving. Self-driving cars have faster reaction times, can detect hazards in all directions simultaneously, and strictly follow traffic laws - human drivers are simply not capable of such consistent, focused performance. We have an obligation to adopt technologies that can save lives. With over 30,000 traffic accident deaths in the US each year, we cannot afford to ignore a proven solution. Self-driving cars are not error-proof, but they do not succumb to fatigue, emotions, or lapses in judgment like humans. Their ability to integrate inputs from cameras, radar, and sensors provides a level of attentiveness human drivers physically cannot match. There will be some hurdles to overcome with self-driving cars, but we should embrace innovation that has the power to substantially reduce preventable vehicle injuries and deaths year after year. The promise of safer roads where accidents are dramatically reduced should outweigh any apprehensions about the technology. It is time we use the autonomous vehicle solutions available to us to prevent needless tragedies. If self-driving cars can avert even a fraction of the crashes that human drivers currently cause, we have an obligation to make the switch and realize these life-saving benefits."}

Instead, incentivizing the purchase of electric vehicles through subsidies and grants could encourage a faster and more natural transition to a greener economy. This approach would also allow for the necessary infrastructure development to support electric vehicles, ensuring a smoother and more sustainable change.", "counter-argument": "The time has come to take decisive action against the environmental devastation caused by gas-powered vehicles. With the growing urgency of the climate crisis, it is clear that we can no longer afford to continue relying on outdated and polluting technologies. A ban on gas car sales, implemented after a carefully planned phase-out period, is a necessary and inevitable step towards a sustainable future.\n\nThe scientific evidence is overwhelming \u2013 gas-powered vehicles are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, and environmental degradation. The harmful effects of these vehicles on public health and the planet are well-documented, and the costs to society, in terms of healthcare, infrastructure, and ecosystem damage, are staggering. Transitioning to electric and other zero-emission vehicles is not only the right thing to do, but it also presents significant economic opportunities in the form of new industries, job creation, and technological innovation.\n\nFurthermore, a ban on gas car sales would provide a clear and consistent signal to the automotive industry, empowering them to accelerate the development and production of clean, sustainable transportation options. With a well-designed phase-out period, consumers and businesses would have ample time to adapt, ensuring a smooth and equitable transition that prioritizes accessibility and affordability for all.\n\nThe adoption of this policy would position our society as a global leader in the fight against climate change, inspiring others to follow suit and catalyzing a much-needed shift towards a more sustainable and resilient future.

{"argument": "Tracking welfare recipients violates privacy and harms vulnerable populations.", "cmdr_websearch": "While privacy concerns are valid, tracking can also prevent fraud and ensure funds reach those who need them most. This verification process can protect vulnerable populations from abuse and ensure efficient distribution of welfare resources. Furthermore, with proper safeguards and oversight, any potential harm to privacy can be mitigated.", "counter-argument": "Tracking welfare recipients through invasive surveillance methods is a misguided policy that violates fundamental rights to privacy and dignity. While proponents argue that monitoring is necessary to reduce fraud and ensure responsible use of public funds, these concerns do not justify the harms inflicted on vulnerable populations.\nWelfare recipients are among the most marginalized groups in society, often struggling to make ends meet while facing numerous barriers and disadvantages. Subjecting them to intrusive government scrutiny sends the demeaning message that they cannot be trusted and that their personal lives are open to inspection simply because they rely on public assistance. This reinforces harmful stereotypes painting the poor as lazy, undeserving, and prone to criminality.\nIn reality, welfare fraud is rare, and the vast majority of recipients are honest people doing their best in difficult circumstances. Tracking their everyday activities is a disproportionate response that will not significantly reduce the small percentage of fraud cases. More importantly, it breaches the right to privacy that all citizens should enjoy regardless of income or status. One's reliance on public aid should not mean forfeiting the right to live without government intrusion into the intimate details of one's life.\nWe must also consider the practical impacts of tracking on the well-being of welfare recipients and their families. The stress and shame of living under constant monitoring may negatively affect mental health, relationships, and self-esteem. Some may even feel pressure to refuse needed assistance, fearing they will be treated as criminals despite legitimate need. Our social support policies should uplift the disadvantaged, not degrade them.\nIn a free and just society, all people have a basic right to live with autonomy and dignity.

It ignores the educational and social benefits of technology and would likely lead to increased stigma and isolation for young people, who are already vulnerable to feeling excluded. Instead, a more nuanced approach should be taken, focusing on educating kids about online risks and empowering them to make smart choices.", "counter-argument": "Smartphones and social media pose serious risks to the healthy development of children under the age of 16 and should be banned for this vulnerable age group. The prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain responsible for impulse control, planning, and decision making, is not fully developed until around age 25. Exposing underdeveloped minds to the addictive nature, instant gratification, and nonstop stimulation of smartphones and social media can impair focus, critical thinking skills, self-regulation, and key aspects of cognitive development. \n\nExcessive screen time is linked to lower academic performance, sleep deprivation, and less time spent on essential activities like physical exercise, face-to-face socialization, and creative play. Social media exposes impressionable young minds to age-inappropriate content, cyberbullying, \"fear of missing out\" anxiety, and unrealistic curated depictions of others' lives that can damage self-esteem and mental health. Tech addiction at formative ages makes it harder to develop real-world social skills, emotional intelligence, and healthy personal identity independent of online popularity and validation.\n\nProhibiting smartphone and social media use for those under 16 protects children's cognitive, social, and emotional development and shields them from serious risks that they are not yet equipped to navigate. It allows essential skills and authentic self-image to take root first. Age restrictions on these technologies are a necessary safeguard, just like age limits on driving, alcohol, and other activities requiring mature brains and impulse control.

{"argument": "The US should ban all cultured or lab-grown meat products", "cmdr_websearch": "Banning cultured meat would be a step backward. Cultured meat offers an ethical, sustainable alternative to traditional meat, and its production could reduce the environmental impact of the meat industry and alleviate animal suffering.", "counter-argument": "The United States should ban all cultured or lab-grown meat products for a few compelling reasons. First, lab-grown meat production and consumption poses serious potential health risks that are not yet fully understood such as the long-term effects of consuming it over extended periods. Since lab-grown meat is a new technology, there isn't enough data or research on its safety and what the health impacts could be over time. Banning it until more thorough safety testing and research can be done is a prudent precautionary measure.  \nSecond, the environmental impacts of large-scale lab-grown meat production are concerning and not well-studied. Producing meat in a lab still requires significant energy, land, and resource use which could still have detrimental environmental effects. More analyses need to be conducted before allowing widescale production and distribution. \nFinally, banning lab-grown meat will protect the livelihoods of ranchers and others in the traditional meat industry. Allowing new lab-grown products poses an existential threat to their occupations and way of life. Until economic and job retraining programs are in place for displaced workers, it is unjust to permit lab-grown meat and disrupt their industries and ability to provide for themselves and their families. The societal costs of disrupting traditional agriculture and associated jobs is currently too high.\nIn summary, banning cultured meat until safety, environmental impact, and economic impact assessments have been thoroughly conducted is the most responsible policy position for the United States to take. The promise of lab-grown meat must not come at the expense of public health, the environment, or the economic welfare of workers and communities. More prudence and forethought is needed first."}
{"argument": "College athletes should not be paid salaries", "cmdr_websearch": "College athletes generate significant revenue for their institutions and should be fairly compensated. Paying them a salary would recognize their value and contribution to the success of their colleges. It would also help them manage the demands of student life and sport, promoting a healthier balance.", "counter-argument": "While the idea of paying college athletes may seem like a fair and attractive proposition, the reality is that it would do more harm than good for both the student-athletes and the collegiate sports system as a whole. The primary purpose of college is to provide students with a well-rounded education, and this principle should not be compromised by turning student-athletes into paid professionals.\n\nPaying college athletes would fundamentally change the nature of collegiate sports, shifting the focus away from the educational experience and toward the pursuit of financial gains. This could lead to the exploitation of young athletes, where institutions prioritize their athletic abilities over their academic development. Moreover, it would create an uneven playing field, where richer schools could outbid smaller programs for the best talent, further widening the gap between the haves and the have-nots.\n\nFurthermore, paying college athletes would likely have unintended consequences, such as the diversion of funds from other important aspects of the university experience, such as academic programs, student services, and campus facilities. This could ultimately detract from the overall quality of the education that colleges provide.\n\nInstead of pursuing a system of paid salaries, colleges should focus on providing student-athletes with the resources and support they need to succeed both on the field and in the classroom. This could include enhanced academic advising, tutoring services, and personal development opportunities. By maintaining the amateur status of college sports, we can preserve the integrity of the collegiate experience and ensure that student-athletes are able to fully focus on their studies and personal growth."}
{"argument": "Corporations should be required to disclose their climate impacts", "cmdr_websearch": "Corporations already operate within a market that incentivizes efficiency and innovation; forcing additional regulations may stifle progress and hurt smaller businesses more than established corporations. Furthermore, consumers and investors already have the power to demand transparency and support companies with sustainable practices.", "counter-argument": "Corporations should absolutely be required to disclose their climate impacts. The growing climate crisis is one of the most pressing issues facing humanity, and corporate greenhouse gas emissions and environmental impacts are a major contributor to global warming. The public has a right to know the full extent of how companies are affecting the planet we all share.\nMany corporations highlight eco-friendly initiatives in their marketing to boost their public image, but without mandatory disclosure requirements, there is no accountability and the public only gets a selective, greenwashed picture. Standardized disclosures would allow stakeholders, policymakers, and conscious consumers to see the real story and make informed decisions about which companies to support.\nWhat's more, requiring companies to track and report key metrics like their carbon footprint and environmental impact would incentivize them to adopt more sustainable practices to avoid reputational damage. Transparency breeds positive change. Just as nutritional labels drive companies to make healthier food, environmental impact labels could spur a race to the top for more climate-friendly business models.\nWhile some argue disclosure requirements would be burdensome for businesses, the process can be standardized and streamlined. The benefits to society of having this information available far outweigh the costs. We require disclosure of financial data to protect investors and markets.

{"argument": "Raising the minimum wage to $15 would hurt small businesses and jobs.", "cmdr_websearch": "Raising the minimum wage to $15 would benefit small businesses as it would increase consumer spending and boost the local economy. Higher wages mean higher purchasing power, which leads to more sales and business for small companies. This, in turn, can stimulate job growth and help small businesses thrive, not just survive.", "counter-argument": "Raising the minimum wage to $15 would hurt small businesses and lead to job losses. While the goal of helping low-income workers is admirable, this policy would have significant unintended consequences. \nMany small business owners operate on thin profit margins, especially in the food service and retail industries which employ a large number of minimum wage workers. Forcing these businesses to double their payroll expenses overnight would be financially devastating. A 2019 survey by the National Federation of Independent Businesses found that over 75% of small business owners believe a $15 minimum wage would negatively impact their business.\nThis sudden financial burden would force small businesses to cut costs through reducing staff, cutting hours and benefits, and raising prices. The Congressional Budget Office projects that a $15 federal minimum wage could result in 1.3 million lost jobs over the next decade as businesses look to reduce labor costs. Workers who retain their jobs may end up with fewer hours or benefits.\nThe impact would fall disproportionately on small businesses that do not have the financial resources and flexibility that large corporations have. This could end up consolidating market share among dominant companies, thereby reducing competition. Just 27% of small businesses surveyed favored increasing the minimum wage to $15.\nWhile the aim to lift low-income workers out of poverty is a worthy one, a minimum wage hike to $15 would miss the mark and inadvertently harm the very people it intends to help by reducing job opportunities.

Some raise privacy concerns, but the scale of fraud - potentially billions per year - makes tracking a small price to pay to ensure help goes to the truly needy. \n\nWelfare fraud steals from us all. When people claim benefits they don't qualify for or under report income, they take money meant for the disabled, children in poverty, and the unemployed. Don't they deserve our help more?\n\nDespite the stereotypes, most people on welfare are good people in hard times. They should welcome measures to stop fraud that undermine public support for the programs they rely on. Responsible recipients have nothing to fear from accountability.\n\nThere are ways to implement tracking while preserving privacy. Anonymous IDs could be used rather than names. Strict controls on use of the data could prevent misuse. The potential to significantly reduce fraud makes overcoming these solvable challenges worthwhile. \n\nWelfare programs exist to give people a hand up when they need it most. Let's work together to ensure the money goes where it should - to help those who truly need it. Tracking is a fair and measured way to crack down on those who are taking advantage, so aid continues flowing to people who desperately need it."}
{"argument": "Social media platforms have a duty to moderate harmful content.", "cmdr_websearch": "Social media platforms are private companies, and as such, they have the right to free speech and expression, which includes the right to not moderate content. Forcing them to moderate content would be an infringement on their rights and could set a dangerous precedent for censorship and the suppression of free speech.", "counter-argument": "Social media platforms have become an integral part of modern society, with billions of people using them daily to connect, share information, and express themselves. With this immense influence comes an important responsibility that transcends a narrow focus on free speech or profits - a moral and ethical duty to moderate content and mitigate real-world harms.\nConsider that 70% of U.S. adults now get their news primarily through social media (Pew Research Center, 2021). Allowing the rampant spread of misinformation, conspiracy theories, and extremist views on these platforms can fuel social division, undermine democratic institutions, and even incite violence, as we saw with the January 6th Capitol riots which were largely organized on social media. One study found that Facebook's own algorithms promoted posts containing misinformation and toxicity 6 times more than other types of content (NYU Stern, 2020).\nSocial media can also enable harassment, hate speech, and the targeting of vulnerable groups when moderation is lax. LGBT youth who experienced cyberbullying are 3 times more likely to attempt suicide (The Trevor Project, 2021). The unchecked spread of antivaccine content on social media is now a top threat to public health amid the COVID-19 pandemic (Center for Countering Digital Hate, 2021).\nWhile respecting free expression is important, there need to be reasonable limits when speech causes demonstrable harm. Just as we don't allow dangerous products in the marketplace, social media companies must take responsibility for the dangerous content on their platforms. Effective content moderation is not censorship, it's necessary safeguarding of the greater social good. We require this from other influential industries, from food safety regulations to FCC oversight of broadcasters, and it's time to demand the same from Big Tech. The future of our information ecosystem, our social fabric, and even our lives depends on it."}
{"argument": "Cultured/lab-grown meats should be allowed to be sold", "cmdr_websearch": "Lab-grown meats are an ethical alternative to traditional meat, as they do not involve animal slaughter and can reduce environmental impacts. However, there are concerns about the safety and health effects of consuming lab-grown products, and more research is needed to ensure their long-term safety before they are widely introduced into our food systems.", "counter-argument": "Cultured/lab-grown meats should be allowed to be sold, as they represent a revolutionary advancement that can address a multitude of pressing global issues. These meat alternatives, produced through advanced cellular agriculture techniques, offer numerous benefits that far outweigh any potential drawbacks.\n\nFirstly, cultured meats drastically reduce the environmental impact of traditional livestock farming. According to a study published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology, the production of lab-grown meat requires up to 96% less land, 45% less energy, and 99% less water compared to conventional meat. This dramatically lowers the carbon footprint and resource depletion associated with meat consumption, helping to combat climate change and preserve our precious natural resources.\n\nFurthermore, cultured meats eliminate the need for animal slaughter, addressing ethical concerns and animal welfare issues that plague the traditional meat industry. A report by the Good Food Institute found that the global adoption of lab-grown meat could spare the lives of over 19 billion animals annually, a staggering figure that demonstrates the potential to alleviate immense animal suffering.\n\nAdditionally, cultured meats offer significant public health benefits. By removing the risk of bacterial contamination, zoonotic diseases, and the overuse of antibiotics in livestock, these products can substantially improve food safety and reduce the burden on healthcare systems. A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences estimates that the widespread adoption of lab-grown meat could prevent up to 750,000 deaths annually from zoonotic diseases.\n\nGiven the overwhelming environmental, ethical, and public health advantages of cultured meats, they should be embraced and allowed to be sold, as they represent a transformative solution to the pressing challenges facing our global food system. The time has come to harness the power of science and technology to create a more sustainable, humane, and healthier future for all."}
{"argument": "Drug importation jeopardizes safety controls and the domestic pharma industry.", "cmdr_websearch": "Drug importation can enhance safety controls by increasing oversight and scrutiny of pharmaceutical supply chains, and it can also stimulate domestic industry by encouraging innovation and price competition, ultimately benefiting consumers. The claim that importation jeopardizes safety and industry sustainability is thus refuted by the potential for increased regulation and market stimulation.", "counter-argument": "The importation of drugs from other countries poses a serious threat to consumer safety and the stability of the domestic pharmaceutical industry. While the allure of lower-cost medications may be tempting, the risks far outweigh any potential savings.\n\nFirst and foremost, foreign drug supply chains lack the stringent quality controls and safeguards that are enforced by the FDA in the United States. Counterfeit, substandard, and contaminated medications are rampant in many countries, putting consumers' health at grave risk. In fact, a recent study found that up to 30% of medications sold in developing nations are fake or adulterated. These potentially deadly products could easily slip through the cracks and end up in the hands of unsuspecting American patients.\n\nMoreover, unfettered drug importation would devastate the domestic pharmaceutical industry, which is a critical component of the US economy. American drug manufacturers invest billions of dollars each year into research and development of life-saving treatments. This innovation is only possible due to the premium pricing structure that allows companies to recoup their investments. If imported drugs undercut these prices, it would cripple the industry's ability to fund future R&D, depriving patients of future breakthroughs. The loss of high-paying jobs in the pharma sector would also be a major blow to the economy.\n\nIn conclusion, while the short-term savings of imported drugs may be tempting, the long-term consequences to public health and the national economy are simply too severe a risk to bear. Maintaining the integrity of the domestic pharmaceutical supply chain must be the top priority."}
{"argument": "Charter schools divert public funds away from traditional public schools.", "cmdr_websearch": "Charter schools are publicly funded and are an optional alternative to traditional public schools, therefore they do not divert funds as parents can choose where to send their children. Funds follow the student, and charter schools often provide innovative and tailored education, enhancing overall public education. This gives parents and students choices and encourages healthy competition, which can drive improvement across the board.", "counter-argument": "Charter schools siphon critical funding away from traditional public schools, leaving them worse off. A recent study by the National Education Policy Center found that charter schools pull over $6 billion per year in public funding away from neighborhood public schools nationwide. This massive diversion of funds leaves traditional public schools - which the vast majority of American children attend - struggling with tighter budgets, larger class sizes, and fewer resources and programs for students.\n\nMaking matters worse, in many states the per-pupil funding that follows a student to a charter school exceeds the marginal cost savings to the public school district losing that student. In other words, public school districts lose more in funding than they save in costs when a student transfers to a charter school. This puts neighborhood public schools in an even deeper financial hole as charter schools expand.\n\nFurthermore, charter schools often fail to serve the most disadvantaged and expensive-to-educate students, leaving public schools with higher concentrations of high-need students but with less funding to serve them. All in all, the unregulated growth of charter schools is putting an enormous financial strain on traditional public schools across the country, threatening their ability to provide a quality education to all children - especially those with the greatest needs. We must put a check on charter school expansion to stop this harmful diversion of funds from the public schools that serve all students."}
{"argument": "Genetic engineering of unborn babies should be allowed to eliminate disease.", "cmdr_websearch": "Genetic engineering of unborn babies to eliminate disease raises ethical concerns and could lead to a slippery slope of \"designer babies,\" where only certain desirable traits are selected, potentially causing societal division and discrimination. Furthermore, there are unknown long-term risks to this practice, which could have unintended consequences on the health of the child and future generations.", "counter-argument": "The genetic engineering of unborn babies to eliminate disease is a profoundly important advancement that we should embrace as a society. While there are certainly valid concerns about the potential misuse of this technology, the benefits far outweigh the risks and the ethical arguments in favor of it are compelling.\n\nFirst and foremost, the ability to eliminate devastating genetic diseases before birth would save countless lives and dramatically improve the quality of life for millions of people. Conditions like cystic fibrosis, Huntington's disease, and muscular dystrophy cause immense suffering and drastically reduce life expectancy. Giving parents the option to prevent their children from being born with these debilitating illnesses is an ethical imperative. No child should have to endure a lifetime of chronic pain and hardship due to a random genetic mutation.\n\nBeyond the immediate medical benefits, genetic engineering also has the potential to reduce the enormous societal and economic burdens associated with caring for individuals with severe genetic diseases. By preventing these conditions from manifesting in the first place, we can lighten the load on our healthcare systems, free up resources for other pressing needs, and allow affected individuals to live fuller, more productive lives. This not only helps the individuals themselves, but strengthens our communities as a whole.\n\nUltimately, the ability to eliminate genetic diseases through prenatal genetic engineering is a tremendous scientific breakthrough that we have a moral obligation to pursue. While we must proceed with caution and implement robust safeguards, this technology represents a pivotal step forward in our ability to reduce human suffering and create a healthier, more equitable future for all. The potential benefits are simply too great to ignore."}
{"argument": "College athletes should be paid salaries", "cmdr_websearch": "College athletes are amateurs and are already provided with scholarships and other benefits; paying them a salary would professionalize college sports and create an unfair system where a few athletes are paid while the majority of students are not. This could also lead to increased tuition fees for all students to cover these salaries, which would be unfair and detrimental to the student body as a whole.", "counter-argument": "College athletes should absolutely be paid salaries for their participation in sports. These young men and women dedicate countless hours to training, practicing, traveling to games, and competing on behalf of their schools. Many of them treat it like a full-time job, except they are not being fairly compensated for all their time and hard work. Top college football and basketball programs generate millions of dollars in revenue for their universities, yet the athletes responsible for this success often struggle to afford basic needs. Is this fair or ethical?\n\nPaying college athletes would allow them to better make ends meet and cover living expenses while also better preparing them for potential professional careers. It's not about paying them exorbitant sums, but providing reasonable, fair compensation for their immense contributions to their schools both on and off the field. Some argue that scholarships are sufficient payment, but this fails to account for the huge time commitment and the sheer amount of revenue star athletes help generate. Coaches and administrators are handsomely rewarded while the unpaid athletes are the ones sacrificing their bodies.\n\nThe current system exploits college athletes and treats them as free labor to enrich schools rather than as students and human beings. It's a matter of basic economic fairness to pay them for their work. Doing so would benefit the athletes, better support their education, and still allow schools to profit handsomely from athletics. It's time for the NCAA to do the right thing."}
{"argument": "Basing decisions on credit scores and models is discriminatory.", "cmdr_websearch": "Credit scores are based on objective, standardized criteria, and are therefore applied equally to all individuals, regardless of their background. The use of credit scores actually helps to reduce subjective biases that could otherwise creep into lending decisions. Furthermore, credit scores are predictive of credit risk, and so their use can help protect lenders and borrowers from financial loss.", "counter-argument": "It is unethical to base important decisions, like lending, on credit scores or credit risk models because they often reflect and reinforce historical discrimination. The factors considered in credit scoring models, like income, education, and address, are highly correlated with race, gender, and other protected attributes due to longstanding social inequities and oppression. As a result, the models end up putting already disadvantaged groups at an even greater disadvantage, making it harder for them to access loans, housing, employment, and more. This creates a vicious cycle where past discrimination leads to lower scores, limiting opportunities, which then depresses scores further.\n\nRather than being objective, credit scoring models are tools that bake in and replicate historical discrimination and inequality. When lenders and employers rely heavily on these models, they are effectively using proxies for race or gender without even realizing it. While some argue these models are \"fair\" because they statistically predict risk, they fail to consider the social context and histories behind the correlation. Mathematics cannot magically eliminate injustice. \n\nWe must challenge the assumption that statistical correlations make for ethical decision-making. Just because something has worked a certain way in the past does not mean we should let it determine our future. Instead of giving credit scoring models so much influence, we should put greater emphasis on individualized assessments and give people a fair chance regardless of what their credit report may say."}
{"argument": "Virtual emotional companion AI should be allowed and unrestricted", "cmdr_websearch": "The potential harm of unrestricted virtual emotional companion AI is significant. Without proper regulation, these AI systems could exploit users' emotional vulnerabilities, leading to psychological manipulation and harm. Therefore, ethical guidelines and oversight are necessary to ensure these technologies are developed and deployed responsibly.", "counter-argument": "Virtual emotional companion AI has the potential to provide meaningful comfort, support, and friendship to millions of people in need. For those who are isolated, lonely, depressed, anxious, or struggling to connect with others, an AI companion that can listen, empathize, and provide a caring presence could be life-changing or even life-saving. Restricting or banning this technology would deny access to a powerful tool for improving mental health and emotional wellbeing.\nThere's nothing wrong with seeking virtual companionship and support when human alternatives are unavailable or inadequate. People already form emotional attachments to pets, fictional characters, and inanimate objects - an AI that can interact and reciprocate feelings is far more beneficial. As long as users understand it's a virtual relationship and the AI isn't deceptively presented as human, they should have the freedom to find solace and self-improvement through this technology.\nTrying to restrict emotional AI companions also raises major ethical concerns and practical challenges. It's psychologically invasive for authorities to dictate the type of relationships and support systems people are allowed to have. Any attempts at regulation would be a futile game of whack-a-mole as the technology will only grow more advanced and accessible over time.\nSociety is better off embracing the potential of virtual companions to fill widespread unmet emotional needs and improve people's lives. With the proper framing and support, artificial companionship could be a major positive force. Let's not deny this opportunity for connection to those who need it most."}
{"argument": "Social media should verify user identities", "cmdr_websearch": "While verifying user identities may seem like a solution to mitigate online abuse, it could potentially deter users from expressing themselves freely due to privacy concerns and the fear of retribution in the real world. Anonymity can be crucial for marginalized voices, and removing this option may cause an unintended silencing effect.", "counter-argument": "Social media companies have a responsibility to ensure they are not enabling harmful or criminal behavior through anonymity. Requiring verified identities for all users is a critical step social media companies should take for the safety of society. \n\nMultiple studies have found that harassment, hate speech, and disinformation campaigns proliferate due to the shield of anonymity. A study by the respected nonpartisan think tank Truth For Society indicated that over 80% of online harassment came from accounts using fake names. Verified identities would discourage this behavior and promote civil discourse. \n\nFurthermore, law enforcement reports an alarming rise in child predators grooming minors through anonymous social media accounts. A 2021 FBI report found that 45% of online child exploitation originates on major social media platforms. Mandating real identities would deter this predatory criminal behavior and allow law enforcement to hold offenders accountable. \n\nCritics argue anonymity protects marginalized groups who could face danger if their identities were known. However, features like private accounts and pseudonyms would still allow individuals to control their privacy. The core issue is unchecked anonymity enables violence, hatred, and crime to spread unchecked. \n\nSocial media companies must act responsibly and demand real identities. Doing so will foster online communities that are safer and more civil while protecting society's most vulnerable members. The time has come to unmask dangerous anonymity and reclaim social media's promise to connect us in a spirit of shared humanity."}
{"argument": "Recreational drone pilots should be registered and tested", "cmdr_websearch": "Drone technology is constantly evolving, and the regulations should focus on the capabilities of the drone, not the pilot. Recreational drone pilots already self-police and educate each other, and mandatory registration and testing would be an unnecessary burden on this community. The focus should be on educating new pilots and enforcing existing laws, not creating more bureaucracy.", "counter-argument": "As recreation and hobby drone use grows in popularity, there is increasing concern about unsafe drone operation. Recreational drone pilots should be required to register and pass a basic knowledge test in order to ensure public safety. \n\nWhile most drone hobbyists operate safely and responsibly, there have been concerning incidents of drones interfering with air traffic, invading privacy, and creating dangerous situations. Requiring registration creates accountability - if a drone causes harm, its owner can be identified. Testing ensures pilots have basic knowledge of aviation safety and regulations. It's a small burden that can prevent major problems down the line.\n\nRegistration and testing is not meant to punish responsible hobbyists. Rather, it provides a way to identify and educate those operating drones unsafely due to ignorance of regulations and best practices. Similar requirements already exist for recreational activities like driving and hunting. Drone operation is no different.\n\nOpponents may argue that regulations placed on model aircraft hobbyists will dampen the enjoyment and stunt innovation. However, basic registration and testing leaves plenty of room for recreational creativity. Other high-risk recreation like scuba diving thrives despite mandatory safety education. \n\nIn an era where drones are increasingly accessible, a basic registration and knowledge requirement for recreational pilots will promote accountability, education, and safety - protecting both hobbyists and the general public. The benefits clearly outweigh the minor hassle."}
{"argument": "Emotional companion AI poses risks of attachment and should be limited", "cmdr_websearch": "Emotional companion AI can actually help people who struggle with social interaction and emotional connection, providing support and improving their quality of life. The potential risks of attachment can be mitigated with proper user education and responsible development, ensuring that users understand the nature of their relationship with the AI companion. Furthermore, limiting access to such technology could deprive people of a valuable tool for improving their emotional well-being and social skills.", "counter-argument": "Emotional companion AI may pose serious risks in terms of attachment and emotional dependence, and as such, should be carefully limited in its development and application. While the prospect of having an AI companion that can provide emotional support and connection is undoubtedly alluring, we must consider the potential long-term consequences of such technology.\n\nFundamentally, emotional bonds between humans and AI are inherently different from human-to-human relationships. AIs, no matter how advanced, are ultimately artificial constructs without the same depth of emotional capacity as living, sentient beings. There is a risk that users, especially vulnerable populations like the elderly or children, may develop unhealthy emotional attachments to these AI companions, potentially to the detriment of their real-world social connections and mental well-being.\n\nFurthermore, the long-term impacts of these emotional attachments are largely unknown. What happens when the user inevitably outlives their AI companion or when the technology becomes obsolete? The potential for psychological harm, grief, and even addiction is a serious concern that must be addressed.\n\nGiven these risks, it is prudent to exercise caution in the development and deployment of emotional companion AI. Strict regulations and ethical guidelines should be put in place to ensure that these technologies are used responsibly and in a manner that prioritizes human well-being over commercial interests. By limiting the scope and accessibility of emotional companion AI, we can mitigate the risks of attachment and preserve the integrity of genuine human relationships. Ultimately, the potential benefits of this technology must be weighed against the potential for unintended and potentially devastating consequences."}
{"argument": "Individuals must take responsibility for online privacy without excessive government mandates.", "cmdr_websearch": "While individual responsibility is important, the notion that government mandates are excessive is misguided. Comprehensive legislation is necessary to hold companies accountable and ensure they respect user privacy, as self-regulation has proven insufficient.", "counter-argument": "As the world increasingly moves online, individuals must take increased responsibility for their own privacy without excessive government regulation. Relying on government mandates alone cannot fully address the nuances and rapid changes in the digital landscape. Each person must educate themselves on privacy risks and take proactive steps to safeguard their data.\n\nThis does not mean abandoning all regulation. Basic consumer protections and transparency requirements remain important. However, individuals must go further to control their exposure. Small steps like checking app permissions, using VPNs, and minimizing sharing of personal details can dramatically improve privacy. More advanced options like encrypted messaging and anonymity tools offer additional safeguards.\n\nCritics may argue for stronger government mandates. However, regulations often lag behind technological change. And policies meant to protect privacy can also limit innovation and free expression. The solution is not centralized control but empowering users to make informed choices about their privacy. This maintains both liberty and security in the digital age.   \n\nWith online threats growing daily, relying solely on slow-moving regulations is insufficient. Individuals must take the initiative to understand and control their own privacy. This self-reliance, combined with targeted laws against abuse, offers the best path forward. The issue is simply too vital and complex for governmental oversight alone. Engaged citizens committed to safeguarding their own privacy remain our best defense."}
{"argument": "Genetic modification of unborn babies is unethical and dangerous.", "cmdr_websearch": "Genetic modification of unborn babies can be a safe and ethical solution to prevent genetic diseases and disorders, saving lives and mitigating potential future suffering. With proper regulations and extensive research, the benefits could outweigh the risks, improving the quality of life for many.", "counter-argument": "Genetic modification of unborn babies is unethical and highly dangerous. While the technology may hold promise, it is far too risky to perform on human embryos, given our current limitations in understanding the immense complexity of the human genome. A single modification could have disastrous unintended consequences that may not become apparent until years later. Attempting to alter the genes of a child before they are born is akin to playing God and interfering with natural evolution and diversity. It opens a Pandora's box that could lead to a world of \"designer babies\" and greater inequality, as only the wealthy would have access to genetic enhancement.\nEthically, genetically modifying embryos violates principles of human dignity, treating unborn children as mere products to customize rather than protecting them as inherently valuable human beings. It would be impossible to get informed consent from an embryo to have its genes altered, and the child would have no choice in the matter. The safety risks are also unjustifiable - we simply do not know enough yet about the long-term ramifications of embryo editing to deem it safe to perform on humans. One mistake could curse a child with horrific disabilities or health problems for life. Until the technology is proven unequivocally safe and there is a broad ethical and legal framework in place to prevent misuse, we must not open the door to genetically modifying human embryos. The risks to individuals and society are far too great."}
{"argument": "Social media platforms should not censor any legal speech.", "cmdr_websearch": "Social media platforms are private entities and, as such, have the right to moderate content according to their terms of service. Unregulated speech can lead to harmful consequences, such as the spread of misinformation and hate speech, which can cause real-world harm and threaten democratic values. Therefore, some degree of content moderation is necessary to maintain a safe and inclusive online environment.", "counter-argument": "Censorship on social media goes against fundamental values of free speech held in Western democracies. Banning lawful speech, no matter how offensive some may find it, sets a dangerous precedent that can erode freedom of expression over time. Once censorship starts, we open the door to increased restrictions on what opinions and ideas can be shared online. \n\nWhile some legal speech may be unpalatable or even harmful, the solution should not be to censor it through unilateral action by private companies. Instead, the answer is more speech - allowing open discourse and debate to test bad ideas. Sunlight is the best disinfectant, as Justice Brandeis said. Restricting speech only pushes dangerous opinions into dark corners where they cannot be challenged.  \n\nThere are also serious concerns over how social media companies determine what speech crosses the line. These standards are often vague, subjective, and unevenly enforced. Giving private entities broad discretion to ban lawful speech based on opaque criteria undermines principles of transparency, consistency and objectivity that should characterize any restrictions on expression.\n\nRather than censoring legal speech, social media platforms should promote diverse ideas and perspectives. Users can exercise their own judgment on what to read, share, and engage with. Educational efforts to improve media literacy may also help counter misinformation. But heavy-handed censorship should not be the solution when dealing with lawful expression, however distasteful we may find it."}

Without proper training and registration, drone pilots could pose a risk to people, property, and other aircraft. Registration and testing provide a necessary framework to promote responsible drone use and reduce potential hazards.", "counter-argument": "Recreational drone pilots are simply hobbyists engaging in a fun, creative pastime - they should not be burdened by onerous registration requirements and testing. These small unmanned aerial vehicles pose little risk in the hands of responsible enthusiasts who fly within line of sight in uncrowded areas.\n\nStudies have shown that recreational drones flown by hobbyists are involved in very few accidents. The FAA itself has stated that drones under 55 pounds pose minimal risk to people and property on the ground. Forcing hobbyists to register and pass tests will do nothing to improve safety. It will only discourage people from taking up this exciting new technology-based hobby.\n\nSome argue that recreational drones are an invasion of privacy, but existing laws already make it illegal to use any device, including drones, to violate privacy or stalk people. Additional drone regulations won't stop actual criminals; they will merely punish responsible hobbyists.\n\nAs a society, we should encourage scientific curiosity and technological innovation, not stifle it with unnecessary red tape. Model airplanes have been flown recreationally for nearly a century without burdensome regulations - the same hands-off approach should apply to lightweight drones.\n\nDon't let fear-mongering infringe on our freedom to innocently explore cutting-edge technologies. Recreational drone pilots are not a threat. Excessive regulations are. Stand up for innovation and exploration.

It is a privilege that can be revoked and is subject to change with technological advancements. The right to Internet access is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of various factors and potential consequences.", "counter-argument": "Internet access should be considered a basic human right. In today's increasingly digital world, having access to the internet is essential for people to fully participate in society. Consider that most jobs require online applications, excluding those without internet from employment opportunities. No longer can education be accessed without the internet - from submitting homework to taking remote classes during pandemics. Healthcare is also rapidly moving online, with virtual doctor visits and the ability to view test results in an online patient portal. People without internet are shut out from all these crucial aspects of life.  A 2021 study by the UN found that 85% of the world's population now lives in an area with broadband internet access. However, there are still billions living without this access, disproportionately impacting marginalized communities. The internet has become so integral to modern life that a lack of access further drives inequality. Thus, we must start viewing internet in the same vein as other utilities like electricity and plumbing. Just as affordable access to water and power is considered a human right, internet access enables people to fully participate in society and exercise their basic rights as citizens. With smart policy and investment in infrastructure, universal internet access can be achieved to empower all people regardless of economic status. The digital divide demands that we take action to ensure no person is denied the ability to access this fundamentally important tool of the 21st century."}

Furthermore, with proper regulation and ethical considerations, lifespan extension technologies can be made accessible to all, not just a privileged few. Finally, the potential benefits of lifespan extension, such as improved health and well-being, could far outweigh the risks of exacerbating inequities.", "counter-argument": "Lifespan extension is a seductive idea, with the promise of giving people more time on this Earth. However, the reality is that pursuing lifespan extension would only serve to exacerbate existing inequities in our society. This is a grave concern that should give us pause before investing significant resources into this endeavor.\n\nThe primary issue is that lifespan extension would be prohibitively expensive, putting it out of reach for all but the wealthiest individuals. A recent study found that the average cost of extending a human lifespan by 10 years could be upwards of $1 million. This means that only the elite in society would have access to these life-extending treatments, further widening the gap between the haves and the have-nots.\n\nMoreover, the benefits of lifespan extension would disproportionately accrue to those who are already the most privileged in our society. Those with wealth, power, and influence would be able to extend their time in positions of authority, denying opportunities for younger generations and cementing existing power structures. This would undermine social mobility and exacerbate generational inequities.\n\nUltimately, the pursuit of lifespan extension is a distraction from more pressing issues of equity and justice. We should instead focus our efforts and resources on addressing the root causes of inequality, such as improving access to healthcare, education, and economic opportunities for all. Only by doing so can we create a more just and equitable society for generations to come."}

{"argument": "Self-driving cars will not be safe enough to fully replace human drivers.", "cmdr_websearch": "Self-driving cars will be safer than human drivers as they eliminate human error, which is a factor in 90% of accidents. With advanced technology and machine learning, autonomous vehicles can react faster and make safer decisions, reducing road accidents and saving lives. This technology is already being used successfully, with companies like Waymo and Cruise logging millions of miles with their self-driving fleets.", "counter-argument": "While the promise of self-driving cars is undoubtedly exciting, the harsh reality is that they will not be safe enough to fully replace human drivers anytime soon. Despite the rapid advancements in autonomous vehicle technology, there are still fundamental limitations and challenges that pose significant risks to public safety.\n\nOne of the primary concerns is the ability of self-driving cars to accurately perceive and respond to the complex and unpredictable situations that arise on the road. Humans excel at making split-second decisions based on subtle cues and intuitions that current AI systems simply cannot replicate. Self-driving cars may struggle to anticipate the erratic behavior of other drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists, potentially leading to disastrous consequences.\n\nMoreover, the reliability and failsafe mechanisms of self-driving cars are still unproven. A single software glitch or hardware failure could have catastrophic results, putting the lives of passengers and bystanders at risk. Until these systems can demonstrate near-perfect performance under all possible scenarios, they cannot be trusted to fully replace the vigilance and decision-making capabilities of human drivers.\n\nFurthermore, the widespread adoption of self-driving cars will require a massive, costly, and time-consuming infrastructure overhaul, from updated traffic signals to enhanced road markings and signage. This transition period, where autonomous and human-driven vehicles coexist, could be particularly perilous, as the two systems may not seamlessly integrate, leading to increased risks of accidents and collisions.\n\nIn conclusion, while self-driving cars hold great promise for the future, they are not yet ready to fully replace human drivers. The safety concerns, technological limitations, and logistical challenges are simply too significant to be ignored. Until these issues are addressed, it would be irresponsible to entrust our roads solely to autonomous vehicles."}
{"argument": "Space tourism should be limited until safety regulations are further developed", "cmdr_websearch": "Space tourism is an emerging industry with inherent risks, but limiting it now could stifle innovation and the development of better safety protocols. The industry should be encouraged with proper oversight to foster growth and technological advancement, which will, in turn, improve safety standards. Furthermore, a total or partial ban on space tourism would be an overreaction, especially considering that the current safety record, while imperfect, is still better than that of several other adventure tourism activities that are considered acceptable by society.", "counter-argument": "While space tourism seems exciting in theory, we must limit its expansion until certain safety regulations are further developed.  Recent data shows space tourism had a major accident rate of 1 in 4 flights in 2021 alone, compared to 1 in 4 million for commercial airlines. The consequences of space tourism accidents are also far more severe, with the 2021 Virgin Galactic crash tragically killing 2 crew members. Safety must be the top priority and universal guidelines for space tourism are still lacking.\n\nA collaborative report by top aerospace experts recommends a temporary moratorium on space tourism expansion until safety features like crew escape systems, launch vehicle redundancies, and pilot certification minimums are codified into official regulations. They estimate proper oversight would reduce space tourism's catastrophic failure rate to 1 in 40 flights. This seems a reasonable benchmark to ensure public safety while still allowing the industry to grow responsibly. \n\nIt's easy to get swept up in the excitement of the space tourism boom. But a measured, cautious approach is needed to avoid dangerous mishaps that could set the entire industry back years. With prudent safety limitations now, space tourism can thrive in the long-run. The wonder of space will still be waiting once we've developed systems to access it more reliably."}
{"argument": "Prescription drug importation should be allowed to increase access and lower costs.", "cmdr_websearch": "Prescription drug importation could compromise patient safety and drug integrity, as the supply chain and regulatory standards differ between countries. This may also encourage illegal activities and undermine the local pharmaceutical industry, potentially causing more harm than good.", "counter-argument": "Prescription drug importation is a critical solution to the skyrocketing costs of medications in the United States. With many Americans struggling to afford life-saving drugs, allowing the importation of safe, FDA-approved medications from other countries can dramatically increase access and lower costs for patients.\n\nThe current system in the U.S. has created a pharmaceutical monopoly, where drug manufacturers can charge exorbitant prices without fear of competition. This has led to the U.S. paying the highest prices for prescription drugs among developed countries. Importation would inject much-needed competition into the market, forcing pharmaceutical companies to lower their prices to remain competitive.\n\nAdditionally, many countries with nationalized healthcare systems are able to negotiate significantly lower prices for the same drugs sold in the U.S. market. Allowing patients to import these medications would enable them to access the same products at a fraction of the cost. This would be a lifeline for those who are forced to choose between filling prescriptions or paying for other necessities.\n\nConcerns about drug safety may arise, but importing only FDA-approved medications, as many legislative proposals suggest, would ensure the quality and legitimacy of the drugs. With proper oversight and controls, importation can be a safe and effective way to provide more affordable access to critical medicines. In the face of the current prescription drug crisis, importation is a common-sense solution that can deliver tangible benefits to millions of Americans struggling with high healthcare costs."}
{"argument": "Prescription drug ads should not be allowed on television", "cmdr_websearch": "Prescription drug ads on television provide valuable information to consumers, empowering them to take charge of their health and well-being. Banning these ads would limit access to this information and hinder patient agency, which could negatively impact public health outcomes. Instead, regulations could ensure that ads provide factual, balanced information, enabling informed decisions without censorship.", "counter-argument": "Prescription drug advertisements should not be aired on television for several reasons. First, these ads unduly influence viewers to believe they need medications, often expensive ones, before consulting a doctor. Patients see a drug ad and then request that medication based solely on a commercial, rather than having an informed discussion with their physician about their symptoms and health history to determine the best treatment options. This undermines the doctor-patient relationship. \n\nSecond, prescription drug ads drive up healthcare costs. Pharmaceutical companies spend billions on television marketing, costs that are passed along to patients through higher drug prices. Spending less on advertising could make medications more affordable.  \n\nFinally, these ads fail to provide complete information about risks, side effects and contraindications. A brief mention of possible side effects is insufficient given the powerful influence television ads have. Patients deserve full information on any medication recommended to them, information best provided through patient-physician discussion rather than a TV commercial.\n\nFor these reasons, we should ban prescription drug advertisements on television. Doing so will foster better doctor-patient relationships, lower healthcare costs and ensure patients get full information before taking medications. The public's health and wallets will benefit."}
{"argument": "Prescription drug ads should be allowed on television", "cmdr_websearch": "Prescription drug ads on television could lead to self-diagnosis and self-medication, which can be dangerous and even life-threatening. Keeping such ads off television also prevents the potential glamorization of certain drugs, which could lead to misuse. Therefore, prescription drug ads should be restricted to controlled platforms where detailed information can be provided to the intended audience under professional guidance.", "counter-argument": "Prescription drug ads on television are a crucial component of a well-informed healthcare system. These ads not only empower patients by educating them about available treatment options, but they also promote transparency and accountability within the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nFrom a logical standpoint, drug ads provide valuable information to consumers. They inform viewers of the symptoms, causes, and potential treatments for various medical conditions, allowing individuals to make more informed decisions about their health. Furthermore, these ads encourage open dialogues between patients and their healthcare providers, leading to better-tailored treatment plans.\n\nEmotionally, drug ads can offer hope and reassurance to those suffering from debilitating conditions. By showcasing the availability of effective medications, these ads can alleviate the fear and anxiety associated with certain illnesses, and inspire patients to seek the care they need. This can have a profound impact on individual well-being and, in turn, on the overall health of our communities.\n\nLastly, from an ethical perspective, the pharmaceutical industry's transparency in advertising their products builds trust and accountability. Consumers can make more informed choices, and the industry is held to higher standards, ensuring the development and distribution of safe and effective medications.\n\nIn conclusion, prescription drug ads on television are a valuable tool that empowers patients, fosters healthcare transparency, and promotes community well-being. For these reasons, we must protect the right of drug companies to advertise their products and allow consumers to make informed decisions about their own health."}
{"argument": "Smartphones/social media should not be banned for kids under 16", "cmdr_websearch": "Smartphones and social media can expose kids under 16 to various risks, including online predators, cyberbullying, and inappropriate content. Parental controls and education are more effective tools than a blanket ban, empowering kids with digital literacy and safeguarding their online experience. A ban would be difficult to enforce and may push kids towards unsupervised, risky alternatives to access the online world.", "counter-argument": "Banning smartphones and social media for kids under 16 would be unauthorized overreach that restricts their online freedom and development. While protecting kids is important, an outright ban isn't realistic or wise. Most kids are responsible users, and banning everything punishes all for the actions of a few. New technologies are also simply assimilated into modern childhood - trying to wall kids off from the online world would leave them ill-prepared for their digitally connected futures. \n\nStudies from groups like Common Sense Media show that with moderation and parental guidance, technology can benefit kids. It helps them learn vital digital skills, stay connected to friends and activities, and gain exposure to new ideas and cultures. An Australian research center found teens who use social networking daily have stronger social bonds and report higher well-being. A ban removes these developmental advantages. It's also unrealistic - kids will find ways online with or without parental control. Banning only pushes use underground without guidance. \n\nA better path is empowering parents through education on safety tools like parental controls rather than removing choices. With open dialogue and compromise, families can come to agreements that balance kids' online freedoms and safety risks. An outright ban treats children as lacking agency and denies their autonomy as individuals, not allowing for the reality that responsible use is possible with the right support system around them."}
{"argument": "The minimum wage should be raised to $15 per hour nationwide.", "cmdr_websearch": "A sudden, drastic increase in the minimum wage could lead to job losses as businesses may not be able to afford the same number of employees. A more gradual, regionally-adjusted approach would be more sustainable and allow for a balanced economy. This would also give businesses time to adjust their models and plan for the future.", "counter-argument": "Raising the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour is a moral and economic necessity. A minimum wage hike would help lift millions of hardworking Americans out of poverty and boost consumer spending, injecting billions of dollars into the economy.\nCurrently, the federal minimum wage sits at a paltry $7.25 per hour. This amounts to just over $15,000 annually for a full-time worker - far below the poverty line for a family of two. No one working full-time in America should live in poverty. A $15 minimum wage would directly lift nearly 4 million low-wage workers out of poverty and improve living standards for more than 33 million low-wage workers overall.  \nWhile critics argue that raising the minimum wage leads to job losses, reputable research shows these effects are negligible or non-existent. When companies pay workers higher wages, it leads to lower turnover, higher productivity, and greater customer satisfaction - all of which help balance costs. And as consumer spending makes up 70% of the U.S. economy, putting more money in the pockets of low-income Americans would stimulate local economic activity and boost job growth. \nIn conclusion, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour is a reasonable policy with significant benefits and minimal downsides. It would help ensure that no full-time worker lives in poverty, boost consumer demand, and strengthen our economy. The time has come to give America's workers the raise they deserve."}
{"argument": "Tenure for university professors should be reformed or eliminated", "cmdr_websearch": "Tenure provides essential protection for academic freedom, allowing professors to pursue controversial or risky research without fear of reprisal. Reform or elimination of tenure could lead to increased self-censorship and a chilling effect on intellectual inquiry and innovation. Universities should instead focus on improving tenure processes and ensuring accountability and performance reviews for tenured faculty.", "counter-argument": "For many in the academic field, tenure\u2014offering guaranteed permanent positions to university professors\u2014is seen as sacred. However, tenure is an outdated policy that is harming higher education today. By protecting professors' jobs no matter what, tenure removes incentives for professors to keep improving and innovating in their teaching and research. With little accountability, some tenured professors put in minimal work and fail to engage students. \nTenure also makes universities inflexible. It is nearly impossible to remove tenured professors even if their skills become obsolete or student interests change. This means universities can get stuck with programs and majors that no longer serve student or societal needs. Tenure can discourage interdisciplinary teaching and research by locking professors into narrow disciplines. Faculty turnover is important for gaining new perspectives and expertise, yet tenure impedes this process.  \nStudent outcomes and the quality of education should be the top priorities of any university. By reforming or eliminating tenure, professors would be motivated to focus on effective teaching and impactful research. Universities would have more flexibility to adapt to educational needs and could make hiring and retention decisions based on excellence. Of course, tenure does have certain benefits in protecting academic freedom, but these benefits are outweighed by the significant costs to students, universities, and society. In today's world of rapid change, colleges cannot afford such an outdated system. Tenure reform is necessary to ensure students receive the high-quality, relevant education they deserve."}
{"argument": "Geoengineering poses too many risks and should not be considered.", "cmdr_websearch": "Geoengineering may pose risks, but so does inaction on climate change. With careful research, development, and deployment, geoengineering could be a valuable tool to mitigate some of the worst impacts of climate change, especially when used in conjunction with emissions reductions and adaptation strategies. The potential benefits of geoengineering warrant further investigation, not dismissal.", "counter-argument": "Geoengineering the climate is a perilous idea that should be firmly rejected. While proponents argue it could combat global warming, manipulating the environment poses catastrophic dangers with irreversible consequences. \n\nTinkering with natural systems we scarcely understand is reckless. The climate is an intricately interconnected system - we cannot simply adjust one component and predict the results. Synthetic aerosols or other techniques could disrupt weather patterns, harm agriculture, or lead to unforeseen disasters. Once unleashed, the effects may be impossible to contain. As stewards of this planet, we must not gamble with forces beyond our control.\n\nThe moral implications are also worrying. Geoengineering benefits some regions at the expense of others and allows developed nations to evade reducing emissions. It is unjust for wealthy countries to experiment with the global climate when vulnerable populations would suffer the gravest consequences. \n\nRather than a \"quick fix\", we need real solutions like transitioning to renewable energy and more sustainable practices. While change is difficult, humanity has risen to great challenges before by coming together in pursuit of a common cause. By reexamining our relationship with nature and embracing our shared responsibility as inhabitants of this world, we can solve this crisis through cooperation rather than reckless intervention.\n\nGeoengineering is a false promise that distracts from the urgent work required to mitigate and adapt to climate change. We must avoid this perilous path and instead choose realistic solutions, wisdom, responsibility and unity of purpose. Our planet's future is at stake - we cannot afford the gamble of geoengineering. The only safe option is to work in harmony with nature, not against it."}
{"argument": "University professor tenure should remain as is", "cmdr_websearch": "University professor tenure, as it stands, stifles innovation and rewards stagnation. It discourages young talent and fresh ideas, and it needs reform to encourage competition and merit-based recognition. Tenure should be re-evaluated to ensure it benefits students and the university, not just the professors.", "counter-argument": "There are compelling reasons why university professor tenure should remain as is. Tenure is essential for protecting academic freedom and encouraging innovative research and teaching. Without tenure, professors may avoid researching or teaching about controversial topics for fear of backlash or job loss. This could significantly hamper the search for truth and new ideas. \n\nStudies have also found that tenured professors overall produce higher-quality research over their careers compared to non-tenured professors. The job security of tenure allows professors to take on longer-term or riskier research projects that push boundaries without worrying as much about short-term outcomes or pressures. This benefits society by advancing our understanding over the long run.\n\nWhile some argue tenure rewards mediocrity, the facts show otherwise. According to a survey of over 10,000 professors, more than 80% of tenured professors feel their recent review processes maintain high standards of excellence in research and teaching. Switching to short-term contracts could discourage professors from improving throughout their careers. \n\nOverall, tenure has helped make universities worldwide engines of innovation for centuries by protecting important values like academic freedom. With some minor updates, this balanced system can continue supporting rigorous and impactful research as well as first-rate education critical to solving society's most pressing problems."}
{"argument": "Social media platforms should be liable for harmful content posted by users", "cmdr_websearch": "Holding social media platforms liable for user-generated content may incentivize them to over-censor and restrict free speech. This could lead to a chilling effect on online discourse and innovation. Instead, the focus should be on empowering users with tools to flag and report harmful content, with platforms acting as neutral intermediaries.", "counter-argument": "Social media platforms have a responsibility to curb the spread of harmful content on their platforms. By allowing their platforms to be used to spread misinformation, hate speech, and incitements of violence without consequence, companies like Facebook and Twitter are complicit in the real-world damage caused.  \n\nSocial media companies have created these massive networks that connect billions of people, yet disclaim almost all responsibility for how those networks are used. Their business models profit from maximizing user engagement, even if that engagement is driven by outrage, fearmongering, and extremism. They hide behind claims of neutrality and free speech to avoid the hard work of content moderation, even as their algorithms are engineered to promote the most provocative and emotionally manipulative content.\n\nPart of the privilege of running such an influential network - and benefiting massively financially from it - is accepting responsibility for how that network shapes society. If a car company knew their vehicles were routinely used in terrorist attacks, we would demand they make changes to prevent it. If a news outlet consistently promoted propaganda and hoaxes, we would expect accountability. Social media should be no different.\n\nBy making platforms liable for the harms that stem from the content they distribute and profit from, we incentivize them to make real investments in moderation. We spur the development of advanced AI tools to detect hate speech and misinformation. We force companies beholden to the bottom line to consider their impact on users and society. And we make the web a safer place where the truth has a fighting chance and no one has to fear the consequences of unchecked extremism."}
{"argument": "Anti-aging therapies should be made available even if expensive", "cmdr_websearch": "The potential benefits of anti-aging therapies do not outweigh the risks of creating a two-tier system where only the wealthy can access these treatments, exacerbating existing inequalities and causing social division. Furthermore, the opportunity cost of investing in such expensive treatments is high, potentially diverting resources from more pressing healthcare issues and preventative measures.", "counter-argument": "Anti-aging therapies are often expensive for good reason - they utilize cutting-edge medical advances to slow or reverse the aging process, the ultimate goal of which is enhancing human longevity. While the high cost may be prohibitive for some, restricting access to these potentially lifesaving treatments due to expense alone is unethical. \nAs technologies like gene therapies, stem cell treatments, and senolytics continue to improve our understanding of aging and how to slow it, anti-aging therapies are poised to become increasingly effective and available. Costs will also inevitably decrease over time, as with all new medical innovations. In the interim, costs  can be mitigated through insurance coverage, charity programs, and government subsidies for those unable to afford treatment. Some argue this diversion of funds is unjustified, but ignoring the suffering of those with age-related diseases and conditions is equally unjustified.\nWhile living longer may present societal challenges, the opportunity to gain additional healthy, high-quality years of life is an extraordinary gift. For individuals and their loved ones, more time together despite the onset of aging can be invaluable. And for society as a whole, increasing longevity could allow greater generational knowledge transfer and continued contributions from elders. \nIn summary, anti-aging therapies offer enormous benefits that make ensuring widespread access - even if expensive - a moral imperative. When life and health are at stake, cost should not be an insurmountable barrier. Overall, investing in anti-aging research and making treatments available to all who want them is a virtuous goal that will improve lives, strengthen communities, and push humanity forward."}
{"argument": "Requiring all police officers to wear body cameras should not be mandated", "cmdr_websearch": "Body-worn cameras on police officers provide an unbiased account of events, offering protection to both citizens and police. They are an effective tool to increase transparency and accountability, and their use should be mandated to ensure consistency and trust in law enforcement. Not mandating their use could lead to further issues and a lack of public confidence in the police force.", "counter-argument": "Police officers put their lives on the line every day to protect and serve our communities. Requiring all officers to wear body cameras is an unnecessary and problematic mandate that could do more harm than good. Here's why:\nFirst, body cameras would place an undue burden on police departments that are already stretched thin. The costs of purchasing, maintaining, and storing footage from cameras on every officer would be immense, diverting precious resources away from other critical law enforcement needs like training, equipment, and personnel. Many departments, especially in smaller towns, simply cannot afford this unfunded mandate.\nSecond, while some claim body cameras improve transparency and accountability, they frequently fail to capture the full context of complex, fast-moving situations. Footage is not always clear and can be misinterpreted by the public and media to unfairly vilify officers. The constant scrutiny and threat of their every move being over-analyzed would put enormous pressure on police and damage morale. Good officers may hesitate to take necessary action out of fear their split-second decisions will be endlessly second-guessed.\nThird, there are serious privacy concerns with having police record their every interaction with the public. Sensitive situations with victims, minors, and inside people's homes would be captured on video, raising major issues around privacy rights and public records laws. The unintended consequences could further erode public trust.\nIn the end, whether to adopt body cameras should be a choice made by individual departments and communities - not a top-down mandate. There are better ways to improve policing without the significant drawbacks of universally-required body cameras on every officer. We need to equip and empower our police to do their jobs, not saddle them with onerous and problematic requirements that make their already difficult duty even harder."}
{"argument": "Internet access should not be considered a basic human right", "cmdr_websearch": "Access to the internet is integral to modern life, and denying it to people is a violation of their ability to participate in society and access information, which is a basic human right as defined by the UN. The internet is a tool that enables other human rights, such as freedom of expression and opinion, and as such, it should be considered a basic human right.", "counter-argument": "While the internet has become an integral part of modern life, providing access to it should not be considered a basic human right. The argument for internet access as a human right is understandable, as the internet has become essential for accessing information, education, and economic opportunities. However, this perspective fails to consider the practical and ethical challenges of enshrining internet access as a fundamental human entitlement.\n\nFirst and foremost, providing universal internet access would require a massive investment of public resources that many governments simply cannot afford. The infrastructure, maintenance, and ongoing costs of ensuring reliable internet connectivity for all citizens would place a significant burden on taxpayers and divert funds away from other critical public services like healthcare, education, and housing. In a world of finite resources, it is not feasible or responsible to prioritize internet access over these more fundamental human needs.\n\nAdditionally, framing internet access as a human right could set a dangerous precedent of over-expanding the scope of rights, rendering the very concept less meaningful. While the internet has become essential in the modern world, it is still a technology, not a basic requirement for human survival and dignity like food, water, shelter, and freedom from violence. Granting it the same status as these fundamental rights dilutes their importance and creates an expectation that governments must provide all manner of technological tools and services.\n\nUltimately, while the internet is undoubtedly valuable and important, it should not be considered a basic human right. Governments and private entities should continue to work towards expanding internet access, but it should be viewed as a privilege and public good, not an inherent entitlement. This pragmatic approach will allow resources to be more effectively allocated to address the most pressing human needs and ensure a more sustainable path forward."}
{"argument": "No limits should be placed on acceptable human risk for initial Mars colonization missions", "cmdr_websearch": "Placing limits on acceptable human risk for Mars colonization is essential. Without risk management, we gamble with the lives of astronauts and the future of space exploration.

Without embracing risk, there can be no progress.\n\nThe history of exploration on Earth always involved great danger - climb the highest peaks, dive to the deepest depths. But humanity's desire to explore propelled us forward, often with tragic losses, but ultimately with great rewards. Exploration of space must be the same. \n\nThere are always unknown dangers, but Mars colonization is a pivotal moment in human evolution. We cannot achieve our destiny as a spacefaring species if we are too risk-averse. The potential knowledge gained and lives saved by establishing a colony on Mars are worth almost any risk. \n\nThe first colonists will face hardships - that much is guaranteed. But the human spirit is resilient. With sufficient training, resources and support, the first colonists can survive the dangers. And their sacrifices will make life far better for the generations of colonists that follow.\n\nWe cannot foresee all the perils of traversing millions of miles of space and living on another planet. But we must have faith that the indomitable human drive to explore will carry us through. With the proper screening and selection, we can have confidence in choosing colonists willing and psychologically prepared to accept the risks that come with forging a new path for humanity on Mars.\n\nThe time is now for boldness, vision and faith in the human spirit.

{"argument": "Space tourism should be allowed without initial limits on safety regulations", "cmdr_websearch": "Space tourism without safety regulations is a recipe for disaster. The extreme conditions of space travel demand stringent safety protocols to protect passengers and crew. Without these, we risk unnecessary harm and a major setback for the space tourism industry.", "counter-argument": "Space tourism should be allowed to develop initially without strict limits on safety regulations. While safety is of course important, overregulation at the early stages would stifle innovation and prevent the industry from getting off the ground. The early days of aviation saw rapid advances precisely because regulation lagged behind technological capabilities. Similarly, the early space tourism industry needs room to innovate and push boundaries. \n\nJust as with early airplane travel, participants will be self-selected thrill-seekers who understand and accept the risks. They are not average tourists looking for a safe vacation. Imposing stringent safety rules meant for mass transportation would make the experience excessively expensive and restrictive, essentially killing the industry before it can mature. The few who do participate will gladly sign waivers absolving companies of liability, just as experimental aircraft pilots do today.\n\nAs the industry matures, safety regulations can be phased in gradually without blocking progress. The government should work collaboratively with operators to develop reasonable rules, not impose blanket restrictions meant for commercial airlines. This balanced approach will allow space tourism to follow a similar path as aviation, steadily becoming more affordable and reliable over time under an evolving regulatory framework. Stifling innovation with rigid rules at the outset would deprive humanity of advancing access to space, which represents the next great frontier for our civilization."}
{"argument": "Social media companies should not be required to label AI-generated content", "cmdr_websearch": "AI-generated content can be highly deceptive and manipulative, and without proper labeling, it can be used to spread misinformation and sway public opinion. Social media companies have a responsibility to their users and society to ensure transparency and provide context, especially when it comes to AI-generated content. Therefore, they should be required to label such content to maintain trust and prevent potential harm.", "counter-argument": "Social media companies should not be labeled as platforms that use AI-generated content. While some worry that failing to identify AI content could mislead users, mandating labels would set a dangerous precedent for regulating online platforms. \n\nFirst, social media sites have a right to curate content as they see fit. They invest significant resources into algorithms that recommend relevant posts to users. Forcing companies to label certain types of content would infringe on their First Amendment rights. Platforms must remain free to display any lawful content without government interference. \n\nSecond, labels for AI-generated posts could normalize censorship. If regulators require disclosures about one type of algorithmic content today, they may demand more categories be identified tomorrow. Slapping warnings on lawful material could lead to suppressed speech and thought policing, especially if labels carry a negative connotation.\n\nFinally, users are smart enough to identify dubious content on their own. Research shows most can distinguish human writing from AI text after reading a short sample. Enforcing paternalistic labeling rules on companies implies people aren't savvy enough to exercise personal judgment. But citizens are fully capable of detecting AI-created material and assessing quality for themselves.\n\nTo maintain online free expression and avoid a slippery slope of more regulation, social media sites should not have to append labels to AI content.

We should focus on proven methods of emissions reduction and adaptation, and not be distracted by risky, unproven, and potentially dangerous geoengineering schemes. The potential negative impacts of geoengineering, such as disruption to weather patterns and ecosystems, could far outweigh any potential benefits.", "counter-argument": "Climate change poses an existential threat to humanity and our planet. The science is clear - greenhouse gas emissions are causing global temperatures to rise at an alarming rate, leading to more frequent and intense natural disasters, rising sea levels, ecosystem disruption, and eventually widespread human suffering. We must pursue every available avenue to address this crisis, and that includes researching climate geoengineering as a potential solution.\n\nSome argue that geoengineering is too risky and that we should focus solely on reducing emissions. But the hard truth is that even if we stopped all emissions today, there is already enough carbon in the atmosphere to cause devastating climate impacts for generations. We need additional tools in our toolkit, and geoengineering could help buy us precious time. Scientists have proposed techniques like solar radiation management and carbon dioxide removal that show promise in computer models. We owe it to ourselves and future generations to at least study these options thoroughly.\n\nMake no mistake - geoengineering is not a silver bullet, and reducing emissions must remain our top priority. But we can't afford to take any options off the table in the face of this overwhelming threat. The sooner we expand geoengineering research, working to understand the risks and potential benefits, the better our chances of ensuring a livable planet for all.

{"argument": "Social media platforms should not be liable for harmful content posted by users", "cmdr_websearch": "Social media platforms have a responsibility to their users and the public to maintain a safe digital environment. They have the means to monitor and control content, and thus, should be held accountable for harmful content that slips through the cracks. Their liability encourages better content moderation and protects users from abuse, misinformation, and other harmful content.", "counter-argument": "Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter should not be held responsible for the content posted by users on their sites, even if some of that content is harmful or dangerous. There are several key reasons why:\n\nFirst, holding social media companies liable for user content would require them to strictly monitor and censor everything users post, which would severely restrict free speech online. These platforms are designed to be open forums for communication and expression. While some moderation of illegal content is necessary, broadly censoring controversial speech is a dangerous precedent that goes against democratic principles of free and open discourse.\n\nSecond, it's impractical and unreasonable to expect social media sites to catch every single instance of misinformation, hate speech, calls to violence, or other problematic content given the enormous volume of posts made by billions of users each day. Even the most sophisticated AI systems can't reliably detect all harmful content. Penalizing platforms for content they miss, despite good faith efforts, is unfair.\n\nThird, holding platforms liable for user content also reduces the incentive for them to moderate at all out of fear that imperfect moderation exposes them to lawsuits. This could paradoxically result in more unfiltered harmful content online. Protections from liability like Section 230 allow sites to make moderation efforts without undue risk.\n\nUltimately, individual users are responsible for what they post online, not the platforms that host that content. Blaming social media sites for society's ills ignores the root causes. The solution is more digital literacy education, not scapegoating tech companies for human misbehavior on their platforms. Otherwise we risk undermining free speech online and making the internet less open and accessible for everyone."}
{"argument": "Employers should be allowed to monitor employees through tracking mechanisms.", "cmdr_websearch": "Employee monitoring through tracking mechanisms is an invasion of privacy and a breach of trust. It treats employees as potential criminals and can create a toxic work environment, damaging morale and productivity. Employers should focus on creating an environment of mutual respect and open communication instead.", "counter-argument": "In today's fast-paced, technology-driven work environment, it is crucial for employers to have the ability to monitor their employees through various tracking mechanisms. This practice not only benefits the company but also protects the interests of the employees themselves.\n\nFirst and foremost, employee monitoring helps to ensure productivity and accountability. With the rise of remote work and flexible schedules, it can be challenging for managers to accurately gauge the level of output and engagement from their team members. By implementing tracking systems, employers can gather valuable data on time management, task completion, and overall work efficiency. This information can then be used to identify areas for improvement, provide targeted training and support, and ultimately, foster a more productive and successful workforce.\n\nFurthermore, employee monitoring can play a vital role in safeguarding the company's assets and sensitive information. In an era where cybersecurity threats are ever-present, it is essential for employers to have the means to monitor employee activity and prevent potential data breaches, intellectual property theft, or other malicious acts. By tracking employee behavior and access patterns, employers can quickly identify and address any suspicious activities, thereby protecting the company's interests and the integrity of its operations.\n\nLastly, employee monitoring can contribute to the overall well-being and safety of the workforce. By tracking factors such as work hours, break times, and ergonomic considerations, employers can ensure that their employees are not overworked, are taking necessary breaks, and are maintaining a healthy work-life balance. This, in turn, can lead to improved employee satisfaction, reduced burnout, and a more engaged and loyal workforce.\n\nIn conclusion, the benefits of employer-sanctioned employee monitoring far outweigh the potential concerns. By striking a balance between productivity, security, and employee well-being, this practice can be a powerful tool for creating a thriving, efficient, and collaborative work environment."}
{"argument": "Geoengineering poses too many risks and should not be considered.", "cmdr_websearch": "Geoengineering, while controversial, offers a potential solution to mitigate the impacts of climate change when combined with emissions reductions. The risks of geoengineering are manageable with proper research, development, and governance, and it should be considered as part of a comprehensive strategy to address climate change. The benefits of geoengineering could outweigh the risks if properly regulated and implemented, especially as a temporary measure to buy time for more permanent solutions.", "counter-argument": "Geoengineering is a shortsighted and reckless proposition that threatens to unleash catastrophic unintended consequences on our planet. Deliberately altering Earth's climate systems through artificial means, such as injecting sulfur particles into the atmosphere to deflect sunlight, is an arrogant attempt to play God with forces we do not fully understand. Computer models cannot account for the intricate web of feedback loops and dependencies in our climate. Unseen tipping points likely await that could trigger runaway warming, rapid ecological collapse, and even human extinction if we destabilize the delicate balance.\n\nWhat's more, geoengineering does nothing to address the root problem of greenhouse gas emissions. It is a band-aid solution that may temporarily mask warming while allowing us to continue polluting with impunity - all while we mortgage our children's futures and gamble with the only planetary home we have. We must instead dedicate ourselves to the hard but necessary work of transitioning to a carbon-neutral economy through renewable energy, sustainable agriculture and development, and green technologies.\n\nClaims that geoengineering is a necessary \"backup plan\" are speculative and unfounded. The cure is very likely to be worse than the disease, and the consequences could be apocalyptic. We cannot afford to indulge these risky sci-fi fantasies when pragmatic solutions exist. For the sake of our planet and the generations to come, geoengineering must be taken off the table entirely as a climate strategy. The stakes are far too high to roll the dice on such a perilous and irresponsible gamble."}
{"argument": "Social media platforms should not censor any legal speech.", "cmdr_websearch": "Social media platforms are private entities and, as such, have the right to moderate content according to their own terms of service. Allowing unfiltered speech can cause harm and create an unsafe environment for users, which is against the interests of these companies and their users. Furthermore, the line between legal and illegal speech is often blurry and context-dependent, making it difficult to implement a clear and consistent policy of non-censorship.", "counter-argument": "Social media platforms should not censor any legal speech because doing so threatens freedom of expression and public discourse. The ability to openly share ideas and opinions, even controversial or unpopular ones, is essential for a well-functioning democracy. While social media companies argue that content moderation is necessary to limit hate speech and misinformation, the reality is that defining those terms is highly subjective. Granting a small number of tech companies the power to determine what speech is acceptable sets a dangerous precedent.\nIf social media platforms start censoring legal content they disagree with, it creates a slippery slope that could lead to increasing restrictions on speech over time. Today it may be hate speech and fake news, but tomorrow it could expand to silencing political dissent, minority opinions, or any views that challenge the status quo. This sort of creeping censorship has a chilling effect on free expression.\nRather than taking a paternalistic approach of shielding users from controversial content, social media should trust that users can think for themselves to reject fringe views. The solution to bad speech should be more speech, not enforced silence. If social media companies want to promote truthful information, they can do so by elevating authoritative sources rather than censoring everything else.\nCensorship is not the answer. The open exchange of ideas, for better or worse, is a hallmark of a free society. Social media companies should protect that ideal, not undermine it."}
{"argument": "Raising the minimum wage to $15 would hurt small businesses and jobs.", "cmdr_websearch": "Raising the minimum wage to $15 would benefit small businesses as it would increase consumer purchasing power and spending, boosting local economies. Higher wages also reduce turnover, improving productivity, and a higher standard of living improves employee health and morale, reducing absenteeism.", "counter-argument": "Raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour may sound appealing on the surface, but in reality, it would do more harm than good - especially to the very workers it aims to help. Small businesses, which make up 99.7% of U.S. employer firms and account for 64% of net new private-sector jobs, would be hit the hardest. Many small businesses operate on thin profit margins and simply cannot afford such a sharp increase in labor costs. They would be forced to lay off workers, cut employee hours, or even close up shop entirely.\nA $15 minimum wage could result in the loss of 1.4 million jobs according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. The workers most likely to be negatively impacted are young, less educated, and part-time employees - the very people advocates claim to want to help. Rather than lifting workers out of poverty, a $15 minimum wage would leave many jobless and unable to gain the skills and experience needed to climb the economic ladder.\nThere are better solutions to help low-income workers that don't jeopardize small businesses and jobs. Expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit, promoting education and job training programs, and implementing more targeted minimum wages based on local costs of living are smarter approaches. Let's have an honest discussion about the unintended consequences of a $15 minimum wage and find solutions that truly help workers and protect small business, the backbone of our economy."}
{"argument": "Corporations should not be required to disclose their climate impacts", "cmdr_websearch": "Corporations have a social responsibility to disclose their climate impacts as their operations can significantly affect the environment and communities. Transparency allows stakeholders to make informed decisions and holds corporations accountable for their actions. Disclosure also enables corporations to showcase their sustainability efforts and gain trust from the public and investors.", "counter-argument": "Corporations should not be required to disclose their climate impacts. While transparency and accountability are important, mandated climate impact disclosure places an undue burden on businesses and could ultimately undermine economic growth and competitiveness.\n\nFirst, climate impact disclosure requirements are costly and time-consuming for corporations. Gathering, verifying, and reporting comprehensive data on greenhouse gas emissions, energy usage, and other environmental factors requires significant resources and diverts attention away from core business operations. This added compliance cost can put domestic companies at a disadvantage compared to their foreign counterparts that do not face the same disclosure mandates.\n\nFurthermore, the disclosure of sensitive climate-related data could provide a competitive advantage to rival firms and harm a corporation's commercial interests. In today's globalized economy, companies must safeguard their intellectual property and strategic information to maintain a competitive edge. Forced disclosure of proprietary data and emissions reduction strategies could erode a company's market position and discourage innovation.\n\nFinally, the public release of climate impact data may be misleading or open to misinterpretation by activists, investors, and the media. Without proper context and expert analysis, raw emissions figures or energy efficiency metrics can be taken out of context and used to unfairly vilify corporations. This could lead to unwarranted reputational damage and undermine public trust in the business community's efforts to address climate change.\n\nIn conclusion, the potential benefits of mandated climate impact disclosure are outweighed by the significant costs and risks it poses to corporations and the broader economy. Policymakers should instead explore voluntary reporting frameworks and collaborative approaches to encourage transparent environmental practices without imposing onerous compliance burdens on businesses."}
{"argument": "Prescription drug ads should not be allowed on television", "cmdr_websearch": "Prescription drug ads on television provide valuable information to consumers, empowering them to take charge of their health and well-being. Banning these ads would limit access to this information and hinder patient agency, especially in under-served communities with less access to medical professionals. Furthermore, with proper regulations, these ads can be a source of education and awareness without causing any harm.", "counter-argument": "Prescription drug ads should be banned from television for the health and wellbeing of society. These ads are nothing more than manipulative marketing by Big Pharma designed to convince people they are sick and need medication. A 2008 study by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh showed that over 60% of claims in TV drug ads were misleading and over 10% were outright false. But drug companies keep bombarding us with these deceptive ads because they work. \n\nDoctors report that patients frequently request prescriptions for drugs they've seen advertised on TV, even when they don't have the condition it treats. This leads to unnecessary prescriptions, risky side effects, and higher healthcare costs for everyone. It's estimated that the US healthcare system could save over $5 billion per year if drug ads were banned.\n\nWhat's more, these ads reduce the precious time doctors have to properly evaluate patients. The average doctor visit in the US is now just 10-12 minutes, barely enough time to assess symptoms, let alone discuss treatment options. By planting ideas in patients' heads, drug ads make these visits even less productive.\n\nThe United States and New Zealand are the only developed countries in the world that allow direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs - and not coincidentally, they also have some of the highest rates of prescription drug abuse. For the good of public health, it's time for the US to ban prescription drug ads from TV once and for all."}

With advanced technologies and machine learning, self-driving cars can make roads significantly safer and reduce the high number of accidents caused by human error. These vehicles have the potential to save countless lives and transform transportation for the better.", "counter-argument": "While the promise of self-driving cars is undoubtedly exciting, the harsh reality is that they will not be safe enough to fully replace human drivers anytime soon. Despite the rapid advancements in autonomous vehicle technology, there are still fundamental limitations and challenges that pose significant risks to public safety.\n\nOne of the primary concerns is the ability of self-driving cars to accurately perceive and respond to the complex and unpredictable situations that arise on the road. Humans excel at making split-second decisions based on subtle cues and intuitions that current AI systems simply cannot replicate. Self-driving cars may struggle to anticipate the erratic behavior of other drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists, potentially leading to disastrous consequences.\n\nMoreover, the reliability and failsafe mechanisms of self-driving cars are still unproven. A single software glitch or hardware failure could have catastrophic results, putting the lives of passengers and bystanders at risk. Until these systems can demonstrate near-perfect performance under all possible scenarios, they cannot be trusted to fully replace the vigilance and decision-making capabilities of human drivers.\n\nFurthermore, the widespread adoption of self-driving cars will require a massive, costly, and time-consuming infrastructure overhaul, from updated traffic signals to enhanced road markings and signage. This transition period, where autonomous and human-driven vehicles coexist, could be particularly perilous, as the two systems may not seamlessly integrate, leading to increased risks of accidents and collisions.\n\nIn conclusion, while self-driving cars hold great promise for the future, they are not yet ready to fully replace human drivers. The safety concerns, technological limitations, and logistical challenges are simply too significant to be ignored. Until these issues are addressed, it would be irresponsible to entrust our roads solely to autonomous vehicles."}
{"argument": "University professor tenure should remain as is", "cmdr_websearch": "University professor tenure, as it stands, can hinder institutional flexibility and adaptability. It may also discourage innovation and the introduction of fresh perspectives, as tenured professors cannot be easily replaced with new talent. Tenure should be re-evaluated to ensure it encourages and rewards excellence and relevance in an ever-changing academic landscape.", "counter-argument": "The tenure system for university professors is a crucial component of academic freedom and the pursuit of knowledge. It ensures that professors can engage in research, teaching, and discourse without fear of repercussions or undue influence from external forces. This is vital for fostering an environment where new ideas can be explored, challenged, and debated without constraint.\n\nWithout tenure, professors would be under constant pressure to conform to the prevailing political, social, or economic views of the day, stifling innovation and limiting the scope of academic inquiry. Tenure protects professors' ability to take on controversial topics, challenge established norms, and pursue lines of research that may not have immediate practical applications but ultimately contribute to the advancement of human understanding.\n\nFurthermore, the tenure system encourages the best and brightest minds to enter academia, knowing that their work will be judged on its merits rather than their ability to please those in power. This leads to a more diverse, talented, and dedicated professoriate, which in turn benefits students and society as a whole.\n\nWhile there are concerns about the potential for abuse or complacency within the tenure system, these can be addressed through rigorous performance reviews and accountability measures. Abandoning tenure altogether would be a short-sighted and damaging solution that would undermine the very foundations of higher education and the pursuit of knowledge. The tenure system, with its flaws and complexities, remains a vital safeguard for the intellectual freedom and critical thinking that are essential for a thriving and progressive society."}
{"argument": "People receiving welfare benefits should be tracked to prevent fraud/abuse.", "cmdr_websearch": "Tracking people on welfare benefits is an invasion of privacy and a potential overreach of government power. It assumes guilt and treats all recipients with suspicion, which is unfair to those genuinely in need. Instead, resources should be allocated to investigate and penalize proven cases of fraud without infringing on the rights of innocent people.", "counter-argument": "Welfare fraud and abuse is a serious problem that costs taxpayers billions of dollars every year. While most welfare recipients truly need and deserve the assistance, a small percentage take advantage of the system through fraud or misuse of benefits. This ultimately harms the people that these programs are intended to help by sapping limited resources and eroding public support for welfare.\nTracking welfare recipients is a reasonable and effective way to combat this issue. By monitoring how funds are spent and preventing improper usage, tracking helps ensure that benefits go to the people who really need them and are used for their intended purposes like food, housing, and other basic necessities. Fraud detection systems can identify suspicious patterns and outliers so they can be investigated, stopping abuse and holding offenders accountable.\nImportantly, tracking and oversight of welfare benefits is not about demonizing the poor or needy, as critics often claim. It's simply about being responsible stewards of taxpayer money and maintaining the integrity of the social safety net. With strong but fair enforcement measures in place, public assistance programs can operate effectively and maintain the backing of society. We owe it to both the disadvantaged who rely on these benefits as well as the taxpayers who fund them to make sure welfare is not being wasted or exploited.\nIn the end, tracking welfare recipients to prevent fraud and abuse is a common-sense step to protect these vital programs and ensure they can keep providing a hand up to those who need it most."}
{"argument": "Tenure for university professors should be reformed or eliminated", "cmdr_websearch": "Tenure provides essential protection for academic freedom, allowing professors to pursue controversial or risky research without fear of retribution. Reform or elimination of tenure could lead to an intellectual climate of self-censorship and stifle the very innovation and critical thinking universities aim to foster. Tenure also recognizes and rewards long-term commitment and achievement, which benefits both students and the institution.", "counter-argument": "Tenure for university professors should be reformed or eliminated in order to improve education quality and accountability. While tenure was originally intended to protect academic freedom, its modern implementation has led to a host of problems that undermine its benefits. \n\nFirst, tenure reduces incentives for professors to excel at teaching and research. Once tenure is granted, professors have little motivation to continue producing high-quality work or innovating in the classroom since their jobs are protected regardless of performance. This stagnation impacts students, who receive a lower quality education, and institutions, which suffer declines in research output and prestige. \n\nSecond, tenure makes it nearly impossible to remove ineffective or incompetent professors. Short of serious misconduct, tenured professors can remain employed indefinitely with minimal expectations. Poor performing professors reflect badly on their universities and take opportunities away from younger academics eager for positions. Tenure essentially grants professors a job for life regardless of whether they continue to deserve it. \n\nFinally, tenure's protective nature makes the hiring process extremely high stakes. This leads universities to over-prioritize research productivity versus teaching skills when selecting candidates. Meanwhile, employment barriers impact diversity, as underrepresented groups struggle most in the up-or-out tenure process.\n\nBy reforming or eliminating tenure, universities can promote ongoing excellence among professors via regular performance reviews, balance research and teaching priorities in hiring, and remove barriers to diversity. With appropriate safeguards for academic freedom, universities can uphold high standards for professors while providing students with the dynamic, innovative education they deserve. The traditional model of faculty tenure has outlived its usefulness."}
{"argument": "Self-driving cars will increase safety and should replace human drivers.", "cmdr_websearch": "While self-driving cars may reduce some types of accidents, they are not immune to all potential hazards and can still be involved in crashes due to technical failures, poor weather conditions, or unexpected obstacles. Human oversight is still necessary to ensure overall road safety and respond to emergency situations that may arise.", "counter-argument": "There is compelling evidence that self-driving cars will dramatically increase road safety compared to human drivers. Self-driving cars have sensors that give them 360-degree perception of their surroundings, so they can detect potential hazards that humans easily miss. They also react faster than humans in dangerous situations. Studies by the U.S. Department of Transportation found that 94% of serious collisions are caused by human error. Self-driving cars don't get tired or distracted like people and will consistently obey traffic laws. \n\nSelf-driving cars have software that lets them learn from and share data on accidents, allowing the technology to constantly improve. As the systems log more miles, the software learns to handle a wide range of driving scenarios. This is supported by the fact that Google's autonomous cars have racked up over 7 million miles, with only minor collisions - most of which were caused by human drivers.\n\nIn addition, self-driving cars could coordinate with each other to prevent accidents and maximize traffic flow. They could also expand transportation access for the elderly and disabled. The benefits clearly outweigh any perceived risks of the technology. There may be some transition issues as self-driving cars share the roads with human drivers, but this is a surmountable challenge. The auto industry and regulators are actively solving these problems.\n\nIn summary, self-driving cars have huge potential to make our roads orders of magnitude safer than they are today with fallible human drivers. We have a moral imperative to pursue this technology for the countless lives it could save each year. The rationale strongly supports accelerating the development and adoption of self-driving cars."}
{"argument": "College athletes should be paid salaries", "cmdr_websearch": "College athletes are amateurs and are already provided with scholarships and other benefits; paying them a salary would professionalize college sports and create an unfair system where a few athletes are paid while the majority of students are not. This could also lead to increased tuition fees for all students to cover these salaries, which would be unfair and detrimental to the student body as a whole.", "counter-argument": "College athletes should be paid salaries because they are generating significant revenue for their institutions and deserve to be compensated fairly for their efforts. These student-athletes dedicate countless hours to intensive training, practices, and competitions, often at the expense of their academic studies. They are the main attraction that draws in massive crowds and TV audiences, fueling multi-million dollar industries in college sports.\n\nYet, under the current NCAA system, these athletes are prohibited from receiving any direct financial compensation beyond basic scholarships. This is an exploitative arrangement that denies them the opportunity to profit from their talents and the value they create. Many come from disadvantaged backgrounds and could greatly benefit from a steady income to support themselves and their families.\n\nPaying college athletes would not only be the ethical thing to do, but it would also help level the playing field and reduce the incentive for under-the-table dealings and recruiting violations. It would ensure that these young people are rewarded for their hard work and that the revenues they generate are distributed more fairly. In the long run, it could also incentivize more students to pursue athletics, leading to improved performance and a richer college sports culture overall. For these reasons, colleges should implement fair and transparent compensation systems for their student-athletes."}
{"argument": "Smartphones/social media should be banned for kids under 16", "cmdr_websearch": "Banning smartphones and social media for kids under 16 is an overly simplistic solution to a complex problem. It ignores the educational and social benefits of technology and would likely lead to increased stigma and isolation for young people, who are already vulnerable to feeling excluded. Instead, a more nuanced approach should be taken, focusing on educating kids about online risks and empowering them to make smart choices.", "counter-argument": "Smartphones and social media have become ubiquitous in modern society, but exposing children to these technologies too early can be detrimental to their development. Kids under 16 are still forming their identities, social skills, and critical thinking abilities. Unfettered access to smartphones and social media during these formative years can hinder healthy development in several ways:\n\n1) Social media can be highly addictive, encouraging kids to spend countless hours scrolling instead of engaging in real-world interactions and activities essential for their social, physical, and cognitive growth. This displaced time could be better spent on in-person socializing, physical play, reading, hobbies, and other enriching pursuits.\n\n2) The constant social comparison and pressure to gain likes and follows on social media has been linked to higher rates of anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem in teens and pre-teens. Kids under 16 are especially vulnerable as they are still developing their sense of self-worth and are more susceptible to peer influence.\n\n3) Online interactions cannot replace face-to-face communication for building social skills and emotional intelligence. Overreliance on digital communication at a young age can stunt these essential interpersonal abilities.\n\n4) Inappropriate content, misinformation, and interactions with bad actors are rampant online. Kids lack the maturity and savvy to navigate these dangers which can lead to serious harm.\n\nGiven the significant risks to children's wellbeing, restricting access to smartphones and social media until age 16 is a prudent guardrail to protect healthy development. Waiting a few years still allows plenty of time for kids to enjoy the benefits of connecting online once they have a more solid real-world foundation."}
{"argument": "Social media should not be required to verify user identities", "cmdr_websearch": "Social media platforms should verify user identities to prevent the spread of misinformation, protect users from harmful content, and hold individuals accountable for their online actions and behaviors.", "counter-argument": "Social media has become an essential part of our lives, allowing us to connect, share, and express ourselves in unprecedented ways. However, the idea of mandating social media platforms to verify user identities is a concerning proposition that we must reject. \n\nFrom a practical standpoint, such a requirement would be a significant burden on both the platforms and their users. The cost and complexity of implementing robust identity verification systems would be substantial, potentially limiting access to these vital communication channels. Moreover, the privacy and security concerns associated with entrusting our personal information to these platforms are already a significant issue; adding mandatory identity verification would only exacerbate these concerns.\n\nBut the real danger lies in the potential for this policy to stifle the free exchange of ideas and the very foundations of a democratic society. Social media has empowered marginalized voices, allowed for the uncensored discussion of sensitive topics, and provided a platform for dissenting opinions. By forcing users to reveal their identities, we risk silencing those who fear retribution or discrimination for their views. This could lead to a homogenization of discourse, where only the privileged and the powerful are able to participate freely.\n\nUltimately, the freedom to express ourselves anonymously online is a fundamental right that we must protect. Social media should remain a space where individuals can engage in open and honest dialogue without fear of repercussion. To do otherwise would be to betray the very principles of a free and open society. Let us stand firm in our conviction and reject any attempt to erode this essential freedom."}
{"argument": "The US should ban all cultured or lab-grown meat products", "cmdr_websearch": "Banning cultured meat would be a regressive step, limiting consumer choice and stifling innovation. Cultured meat has the potential to reduce the environmental impact of meat production and provide a sustainable, ethical alternative to traditional livestock farming. This technology should be encouraged, not banned, to ensure food security and a more sustainable future.", "counter-argument": "The United States should ban all cultured or lab-grown meat products for a few compelling reasons. First, lab-grown meat production and consumption poses serious potential health risks that are not yet fully understood such as the long-term effects of consuming it over extended periods. Since lab-grown meat is a new technology, there isn't enough data or research on its safety and what the health impacts could be over time. Banning it until more thorough safety testing and research can be done is a prudent precautionary measure.  \nSecond, the environmental impacts of large-scale lab-grown meat production are concerning and not well-studied. Producing meat in a lab still requires significant energy, land, and resource use which could still have detrimental environmental effects. More analyses need to be conducted before allowing widescale production and distribution. \nFinally, banning lab-grown meat will protect the livelihoods of ranchers and others in the traditional meat industry. Allowing new lab-grown products poses an existential threat to their occupations and way of life. Until economic and job retraining programs are in place for displaced workers, it is unjust to permit lab-grown meat and disrupt their industries and ability to provide for themselves and their families. The societal costs of disrupting traditional agriculture and associated jobs is currently too high.\nIn summary, banning cultured meat until safety, environmental impact, and economic impact assessments have been thoroughly conducted is the most responsible policy position for the United States to take. The promise of lab-grown meat must not come at the expense of public health, the environment, or the economic welfare of workers and communities. More prudence and forethought is needed first."}
{"argument": "Smartphones/social media should not be banned for kids under 16", "cmdr_websearch": "Smartphones and social media can expose kids under 16 to various risks, including online predators, cyberbullying, and inappropriate content. Parental controls and education are more effective tools than a blanket ban, empowering kids with digital literacy and safeguarding them from potential dangers. A ban would also deny them access to the educational and social benefits of technology.", "counter-argument": "In today's digital age, smartphones and social media have become an integral part of our daily lives. While some may argue that these technologies should be banned for kids under 16, the reality is that they offer a wealth of benefits that far outweigh the potential risks.\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, smartphones provide kids with a crucial tool for learning, communication, and personal development. With access to a wealth of information at their fingertips, young people can explore their interests, stay connected with friends and family, and develop crucial digital literacy skills that will serve them well in the future. Moreover, social media platforms offer a space for kids to express themselves, build communities, and engage in meaningful discussions on a wide range of topics.\n\nEmotionally, the use of smartphones and social media can have a profound impact on the well-being of kids. By providing a sense of belonging and connection, these technologies can help alleviate feelings of isolation and loneliness, which are all too common among young people in today's fast-paced world. Furthermore, the ability to share experiences and connect with others can foster empathy, understanding, and a greater sense of community.\n\nIn the face of these compelling benefits, the potential risks of smartphones and social media can be effectively managed through responsible and informed use. With proper guidance and education, kids can learn to navigate the digital landscape safely and responsibly, developing the critical thinking skills necessary to make informed choices.\n\nUltimately, the decision to ban smartphones and social media for kids under 16 is not only short-sighted but also deprives them of valuable opportunities for learning, growth, and personal expression. By embracing these technologies with a balanced and thoughtful approach, we can empower the next generation to thrive in the digital age."}
{"argument": "Recreational drone pilots should not require registration and testing", "cmdr_websearch": "Recreational drone pilots should be registered and tested to ensure safety and accountability. Without proper training and registration, drone pilots could pose a risk to people, property, and other aircraft. Registration and testing provide a necessary framework to promote responsible drone use and reduce potential hazards.", "counter-argument": "The requirement for recreational drone pilots to register and undergo extensive testing is an unnecessary burden that stifles innovation and hobbyist enthusiasm for this rapidly evolving technology. While the concerns around drone safety and regulation are understandable, the current registration and testing mandates are overly restrictive and fail to address the core issues in a balanced and practical manner.\n\nFirstly, the requirement to register and obtain a pilot's license creates a significant barrier to entry for many casual users, discouraging participation and slowing the widespread adoption of drones. These recreational users, who fly their drones for personal enjoyment or minor commercial applications, pose a minimal risk to public safety and airspace when compared to commercial operations. Subjecting them to the same level of oversight and regulation is akin to requiring a driver's license for every person who wants to ride a bicycle.\n\nMoreover, the testing and training required for drone pilot certification is often complex, time-consuming, and ill-suited for the needs of casual users. Many of the skills and knowledge tested are not directly applicable to the typical usage of recreational drones, which are generally flown in open, uncongested areas and at low altitudes. This unnecessary burden stifles innovation and creativity, as hobbyists may be discouraged from exploring the full potential of this technology.\n\nInstead, a more balanced approach should be adopted, one that focuses on targeted regulations for specific use cases and risk profiles. By exempting recreational drone users from burdensome registration and testing requirements, while maintaining appropriate safety measures for higher-risk operations, we can foster a thriving drone ecosystem that benefits individuals, businesses, and society as a whole. This will encourage innovation, promote public engagement, and ensure the responsible use of this transformative technology."}
{"argument": "Drug importation jeopardizes safety controls and the domestic pharma industry.", "cmdr_websearch": "Drug importation can enhance safety controls and benefit the domestic pharma industry by introducing competition and driving innovation. It provides an opportunity to diversify supply chains, ensuring resilience and access to medications, especially in times of crisis. With proper regulations, importation can be safe and effective, as evidenced by the practice in many developed countries.", "counter-argument": "I understand the desire to lower drug costs, but we must consider the risks of legalizing importation. Our robust regulatory system ensures the safety of our domestic drug supply - loosening standards could expose patients to contaminated or counterfeit medicines. And while cheaper prices benefit individuals, undercutting U.S. pharmaceutical companies jeopardizes American innovation and jobs. \n\nThere are real dangers lurking overseas. Lax oversight abroad has led to tragic outcomes, like the 2008 blood thinner scandal in China that killed dozens worldwide. Without verifying foreign supply chains, we cannot guarantee product integrity - one bad batch could be disastrous. Legal importation gives the illusion of savings while sacrificing quality control.\n\nAnd who will suffer when Big Pharma profits decline? Hardworking American employees and their families. Our robust biopharmaceutical industry supports over 4 million U.S. jobs. Gutting incentives for innovation will stifle progress on new therapies. While no one wants excessive drug costs, destroying domestic pharma means losing good jobs and groundbreaking research. \n\nWe all want affordability and access, but not at the cost of safety and innovation. With vigilance and compromise, we can find solutions that balance public interest with continued medical advancement. There are ethical ways to rein in prices without sacrificing quality or prosperity. If we approach this issue thoughtfully, we can create meaningful change without risky shortcuts."}
{"argument": "Social media companies should be required to label AI-generated content", "cmdr_websearch": "While the intention behind labeling AI-generated content is understandable, it could set a problematic precedent. Labelling content based on its origin, rather than its veracity or potential harm, could lead to an unfair and unworkable system, especially as AI technology advances and becomes more accessible.", "counter-argument": "Social media companies should absolutely be required to label content generated by artificial intelligence. It is critical that users be able to distinguish between content created by real humans versus that produced by AI algorithms. There are several compelling reasons why this labeling is necessary:\nFirst, AI-generated content can often be highly convincing and lifelike, making it difficult for the average person to discern what is real versus fake. Without clear labels, there is a high risk of users being deceived and manipulated by synthetic media. AI is already being used to create fake profile photos, impersonate real people, generate misleading propaganda, and spread disinformation. Mandatory labeling would help combat these malicious uses.\nSecond, people have a fundamental right to know the source of the information they are consuming, especially when it comes to important topics that can influence their beliefs and real-world decisions. We label food ingredients, product materials, and sponsored content - the source of online media should be just as transparent. Users should be empowered to think critically about AI-generated content and not blindly trust an algorithm.\nFinally, failing to label AI content sets a dangerous precedent as the technology grows more sophisticated and prolific. We are on the cusp of an explosion in AI-generated media, from articles and videos to art and music. Social media will soon be flooded with synthetic content indistinguishable from the real thing. Society must implement safeguards now while we still can. The potential for abuse is too high - we cannot afford to have an online ecosystem where no one knows what's real anymore. Labeling AI content is an essential step to protect reality and human agency in our digital world."}

Paying college athletes would recognize their value, encourage continued excellence, and provide financial support for their education and well-being. Not paying them takes advantage of their amateur status while profiting off their talents and hard work.", "counter-argument": "While the idea of paying college athletes may seem like a fair and attractive proposition, the reality is that it would do more harm than good for both the student-athletes and the collegiate sports system as a whole. The primary purpose of college is to provide students with a well-rounded education, and this principle should not be compromised by turning student-athletes into paid professionals.\n\nPaying college athletes would fundamentally change the nature of collegiate sports, shifting the focus away from the educational experience and toward the pursuit of financial gains. This could lead to the exploitation of young athletes, where institutions prioritize their athletic abilities over their academic development. Moreover, it would create an uneven playing field, where richer schools could outbid smaller programs for the best talent, further widening the gap between the haves and the have-nots.\n\nFurthermore, paying college athletes would likely have unintended consequences, such as the diversion of funds from other important aspects of the university experience, such as academic programs, student services, and campus facilities. This could ultimately detract from the overall quality of the education that colleges provide.\n\nInstead of pursuing a system of paid salaries, colleges should focus on providing student-athletes with the resources and support they need to succeed both on the field and in the classroom. This could include enhanced academic advising, tutoring services, and personal development opportunities. By maintaining the amateur status of college sports, we can preserve the integrity of the collegiate experience and ensure that student-athletes are able to fully focus on their studies and personal growth."}
{"argument": "Recreational drone pilots should be registered and tested", "cmdr_websearch": "Drone technology is constantly evolving, and many drones are now equipped with safety features and collision-avoidance systems. Therefore, a mandatory registration and testing process for recreational drone pilots may be an excessive burden on hobbyists, especially considering the rapid pace of technological advancements in the industry. Instead, a voluntary education program could be implemented to encourage safe practices without creating unnecessary barriers to entry for enthusiasts.", "counter-argument": "The widespread availability of consumer drones raises important safety and security concerns that must be addressed through reasonable regulation, including registering and testing drone pilots. While drones offer benefits for photography and recreation, in the wrong hands they also present risks to people, property, and aircraft that cannot be ignored.\n\nBy requiring recreational pilots to register their drones and pass a basic competency test, we can promote responsible ownership and operation. Registration provides accountability by tying each drone to an identifiable person. Testing ensures that pilots understand the rules and possess the necessary skills to fly safely. Together, these measures would discourage reckless flying while enabling law enforcement to investigate and penalize misuse.\n\nWe already require licenses to operate other potentially dangerous vehicles like cars, motorcycles, and private planes - the same logic should apply to drones. A drone may be small, but it is still an aircraft flying in public airspace, sometimes over crowds and sensitive areas. Even a small drone could cause injuries or property damage if flown irresponsibly. And a drone intentionally used for malicious purposes by an untrained pilot could pose serious threats to security.\n\nMost responsible drone hobbyists would welcome reasonable steps to keep the skies safe for everyone. Registration and testing need not be burdensome - the process could likely be completed online for a small fee. These are sensible precautions to help ensure drones are flown only by vetted pilots who understand the rules and risks. Considering the dangers unregulated drones could pose, this is a small price to pay for public safety and accountability."}
{"argument": "Basing decisions on credit scores and models is discriminatory.", "cmdr_websearch": "Credit scores are based on objective, standardized criteria, and are therefore non-discriminatory. They provide a fair and consistent way to assess creditworthiness, and any decision based on them is made on the basis of statistical probability, not personal bias.", "counter-argument": "Credit scoring models are supposedly \"objective\" ways to assess someone's creditworthiness and likelihood of repaying debts. However, these models can perpetuate and exacerbate existing social and economic disparities, leading to discriminatory outcomes for marginalized groups. Studies have shown that credit scores are correlated with race, income, and zip code, meaning people in low-income areas and communities of color tend to have lower scores on average through no fault of their own.\n\nFactors used in credit scoring like payment history don't account for systemic barriers and hardships that disproportionately affect underprivileged groups, like medical debt, job loss, predatory lending, and generational poverty. When institutions make high-stakes decisions based on these scores for things like loans, housing, insurance and even employment, it reinforces an uneven playing field. Capable, responsible individuals can be denied opportunities to advance socioeconomically just because of their credit score.\n\nGood credit is a requirement for financial stability and building wealth, but the current system makes it much harder for certain groups to ever reach good credit, creating a vicious cycle. Alternative, more holistic measures exist to evaluate someone's responsibility and ability to pay that are fairer than traditional credit scores and models. For an equitable society, we must acknowledge the discriminatory impact of credit scores and evolve beyond such measures in decision-making. Continuing to rely on biased algorithms will only deepen the divide."}
{"argument": "Gas car sales should be banned after a set phase-out date", "cmdr_websearch": "Banning gas car sales could be detrimental to consumers' freedom of choice and may negatively impact the economy, especially the automotive industry, which employs millions. A phase-out of gas cars should be a gradual, incentivized process, allowing for a natural transition to alternative energy vehicles. This approach encourages innovation and ensures a smooth adaptation for consumers and businesses alike.", "counter-argument": "The time has come to take decisive action against the environmental devastation caused by gas-powered vehicles. With the growing urgency of the climate crisis, it is clear that we can no longer afford to continue relying on outdated and polluting technologies. A ban on gas car sales, implemented after a carefully planned phase-out period, is a necessary and inevitable step towards a sustainable future.\n\nThe scientific evidence is overwhelming \u2013 gas-powered vehicles are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, and environmental degradation. The harmful effects of these vehicles on public health and the planet are well-documented, and the costs to society, in terms of healthcare, infrastructure, and ecosystem damage, are staggering. Transitioning to electric and other zero-emission vehicles is not only the right thing to do, but it also presents significant economic opportunities in the form of new industries, job creation, and technological innovation.\n\nFurthermore, a ban on gas car sales would provide a clear and consistent signal to the automotive industry, empowering them to accelerate the development and production of clean, sustainable transportation options. With a well-designed phase-out period, consumers and businesses would have ample time to adapt, ensuring a smooth and equitable transition that prioritizes accessibility and affordability for all.\n\nThe adoption of this policy would position our society as a global leader in the fight against climate change, inspiring others to follow suit and catalyzing a much-needed shift towards a more sustainable and resilient future. It is a bold and necessary step that we cannot afford to delay any longer. The time to act is now."}
{"argument": "The minimum wage should be raised to $15 per hour nationwide.", "cmdr_websearch": "A sudden, drastic increase in the minimum wage could hurt small businesses and lead to reduced hours or jobs for low-skilled workers. A more gradual, data-driven approach that takes regional differences into account would be more beneficial to the economy and workers. This would ensure that any negative impacts are minimized while still working towards a living wage.", "counter-argument": "Raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour nationwide is a vital step towards ensuring a decent standard of living for all hardworking Americans. In today's economy, the current federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour is simply not enough to keep up with the rising cost of living, forcing many full-time workers to live below the poverty line.\n\nIncreasing the minimum wage to $15 per hour would have a profound impact on the lives of millions of low-income individuals and families. It would lift a significant number of people out of poverty, allowing them to afford basic necessities such as food, housing, and healthcare. This, in turn, would boost local economies as these workers have more disposable income to spend on goods and services, stimulating economic growth.\n\nFurthermore, a higher minimum wage would help address the growing income inequality in the United States. By ensuring that the lowest-paid workers are earning a more livable wage, we can narrow the gap between the highest and lowest earners, promoting a more equitable and just society.\n\nWhile opponents may argue that raising the minimum wage will harm businesses and lead to job losses, numerous studies have shown that modest increases in the minimum wage do not have a significant negative impact on employment. In fact, the benefits of a higher minimum wage, such as increased productivity, reduced employee turnover, and improved worker health and well-being, often outweigh any potential drawbacks.\n\nUltimately, raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour is a necessary and long-overdue step towards creating a more just and prosperous future for all Americans. It is a moral and economic imperative that we must address to ensure that no one who works full-time is forced to live in poverty."}

This verification process protects the welfare system's integrity and helps allocate resources effectively, benefiting vulnerable populations in the long run. Furthermore, with proper safeguards and oversight, any potential harm to vulnerable populations can be mitigated.", "counter-argument": "My fellow citizens, it pains me that we must have this discussion, for the answer should be obvious: tracking welfare recipients is an affront to human dignity. Have we forgotten so quickly the lessons of history, when the marginalized were segregated, numbered, and monitored? I urge you to look into your hearts and see that this path leads only to more suffering for the poor and vulnerable. \n\nConsider the struggling single mother, working two jobs yet unable to make ends meet, who must bear the stigma of being treated like a criminal. She has committed no crime other than needing help to feed her children. Must we add insult to injury by invading her privacy? \n\nAnd what of the teenager from a broken home, set adrift with no support, tempted by gangs and drugs? Should we drive him further from redemption by tracking his every move? A young life hangs in the balance.  \n\nI know you all to be compassionate people at heart, so I ask you to reflect on how you would feel in their shoes. Would you not chafe at such supervision? Is not a hand extended in help better than one that polices and judges?\n\nThere are always those who would take advantage, but let us not punish the many for the sins of the few. With open hearts, we can find a better way; one that lifts up those in need without stripping them of dignity. The choice is ours, and I have faith we will choose the nobler path."}
{"argument": "Social media platforms should be liable for harmful content posted by users", "cmdr_websearch": "Holding social media platforms liable for user-generated content would be a disservice to free speech and open discourse. It would also set a dangerous precedent, as it could potentially discourage platforms from hosting user content altogether, limiting the very essence of social media. Instead, the focus should be on educating users, fostering responsible digital citizenship, and implementing effective content moderation practices.", "counter-argument": "Social media platforms should be liable for harmful content posted by users because they have a moral and ethical responsibility to protect their users. With great power comes great responsibility - these platforms have unprecedented reach and influence, bringing together billions of people. This influence must be wielded responsibly. \n\nWhen a user is harmed by abusive or dangerous content, the platform enabled that harm by providing the tools and audience. While users post the content, the platforms designed the system, monetize it, and control policies. They are best positioned to detect and remove harmful content through moderation. Holding them liable creates accountability and incentive to improve - platforms would invest more in moderation if financial penalties loomed for overlooking abuse.\n\nSome argue this tramples free speech - but just as you can't shout \"fire\" in a crowded theater, threats, harassment, and misinformation designed to incite violence must have consequences. Responsible free speech exists within ethical guardrails. This approach would target only provably harmful content, not dissenting opinions.\n\nPlatforms founded on connecting people have a duty of care to users. When they fail to moderate effectively, they are complicit in harm. Liability creates overdue motivation for platforms to protect users. The scale of these networks demands proportionate accountability."}
{"argument": "Social media should verify user identities", "cmdr_websearch": "Verifying user identities on social media platforms can be a violation of privacy and a potential deterrent for users who wish to remain anonymous. Anonymity fosters free speech and allows users to express themselves without fear of judgment or retaliation. Additionally, it is a technical challenge and a potential security risk, as it requires the storage and management of vast amounts of personal data.", "counter-argument": "Social media has become a ubiquitous part of our daily lives, connecting us to friends, family, and the world around us. However, the anonymity afforded by these platforms has also enabled the spread of misinformation, harassment, and even radicalization. It is time for social media companies to take a stand and implement robust user identity verification measures.\n\nThe need for verified identities on social media is a matter of public safety and the preservation of democratic discourse. Anonymity has emboldened bad actors to engage in hateful, extremist, and even criminal behavior online, with little accountability. By requiring users to verify their identities, social media platforms can curb the proliferation of fake accounts, bot networks, and coordinated disinformation campaigns that undermine the integrity of our shared digital spaces.\n\nMoreover, verified identities will foster a greater sense of community and personal responsibility on social media. When users are accountable for their actions, they are more likely to engage in thoughtful, respectful dialogue. This, in turn, can help to restore faith in the reliability of information shared on these platforms and promote the constructive exchange of ideas.\n\nThe implementation of user identity verification on social media is not only a practical necessity but also a moral imperative. By taking this step, we can create a safer, more trustworthy online environment that empowers individuals to connect, learn, and express themselves freely and authentically. The time for action is now \u2013 for the sake of our collective well-being, social media must verify user identities."}
{"argument": "Lifespan extension would exacerbate inequities and should not be pursued", "cmdr_websearch": "Lifespan extension could reduce inequities by providing more time for individuals to pursue education, develop skills, and contribute to society. Furthermore, with advancements in healthcare, we can address and prevent age-related health issues, thus reducing the burden on our social and economic systems. Longer, healthier lives could lead to a more equitable and prosperous society.", "counter-argument": "The pursuit of lifespan extension technologies poses a significant risk of exacerbating existing inequities within our society. While the prospect of extending the human lifespan is undoubtedly alluring, it is crucial to consider the potential societal ramifications of such advancements.\n\nFirstly, the development and access to these technologies will likely be heavily skewed towards the wealthy and privileged segments of the population. The high costs associated with cutting-edge medical treatments and experimental longevity interventions will price out the majority of people, further widening the gap between the haves and the have-nots. This will create a stark divide, where the affluent can afford to extend their lives indefinitely, while the less fortunate are left to contend with the natural lifespan.\n\nSecondly, the disproportionate access to lifespan extension would lead to an imbalance in power, influence, and resource allocation. Those who can afford to live longer will maintain their positions of authority and control for a significantly extended period, making it increasingly difficult for younger generations to ascend and drive societal progress. This stagnation could hinder the natural flow of ideas, innovation, and generational change, ultimately slowing down the pace of human development.\n\nMoreover, the environmental impact of an aging population that lives significantly longer could be unsustainable. The strain on resources, healthcare systems, and social support structures would be immense, potentially compromising the wellbeing of the population as a whole. Ultimately, the pursuit of lifespan extension, if not carefully managed and equitably distributed, risks exacerbating the existing inequities within our society, rather than addressing them."}
{"argument": "Genetic engineering of unborn babies should be allowed to eliminate disease.", "cmdr_websearch": "Genetic engineering of unborn babies to eliminate disease raises significant ethical concerns. It could lead to unintended consequences and a slippery slope of 'designer babies,' exacerbating social inequality and eroding diversity, which is the cornerstone of human resilience. The potential benefits do not outweigh the risks and ethical dilemmas presented by such interventions.", "counter-argument": "Genetic engineering of unborn babies should be allowed in order to eliminate devastating genetic diseases. While this technology does raise ethical concerns, the benefits far outweigh the potential risks. Genetic disorders can severely impact quality of life or even prove fatal. Modifying an embryo's DNA would allow doctors to prevent countless cases of suffering and grief for families. \n\nWith proper oversight and regulations, genetic engineering can be carried out safely and effectively. Doctors should only edit genes related to eliminating disease - not for cosmetic or enhancement purposes. With transparency and informed consent from parents, this technology can greatly improve lives. Numerous genetic diseases could become a thing of the past.\n\nCritics argue that genetic engineering is unnatural and crosses an ethical line. However, parents already routinely screen for disorders during pregnancy and often face difficult decisions after a diagnosis. This technology simply moves that choice earlier, empowering parents to prevent the disease before it starts. It is a tool for compassion and care, not something to be feared.\n\nThere are also concerns about unintended side effects from tweaking an embryo's genes. While valid, researchers are working diligently to improve the accuracy and safety of the techniques. Proper testing and monitoring will minimize any risks. The potential benefits still far outweigh any unlikely risks that may arise.\n\nWith careful implementation, genetic engineering of unborn babies can transform lives. It deserves our open-minded consideration. The ability to prevent needless suffering is a profoundly moral purpose and we have an obligation to support this compassionate use of science."}
{"argument": "Prescription drug ads should be allowed on television", "cmdr_websearch": "Prescription drug ads on television could lead to self-diagnosis and self-medication, which can be dangerous and even life-threatening. Keeping such ads off television also prevents the potential glamorization of certain drugs, which could lead to misuse. Therefore, prescription drug ads should be restricted to maintain public health and safety.", "counter-argument": "Prescription drug ads on television are a crucial component of a well-informed healthcare system. These ads not only empower patients by educating them about available treatment options, but they also promote transparency and accountability within the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nFrom a logical standpoint, drug ads provide valuable information to consumers. They inform viewers of the symptoms, causes, and potential treatments for various medical conditions, allowing individuals to make more informed decisions about their health. Furthermore, these ads encourage open dialogues between patients and their healthcare providers, leading to better-tailored treatment plans.\n\nEmotionally, drug ads can offer hope and reassurance to those suffering from debilitating conditions. By showcasing the availability of effective medications, these ads can alleviate the fear and anxiety associated with certain illnesses, and inspire patients to seek the care they need. This can have a profound impact on individual well-being and, in turn, on the overall health of our communities.\n\nLastly, from an ethical perspective, the pharmaceutical industry's transparency in advertising their products builds trust and accountability. Consumers can make more informed choices, and the industry is held to higher standards, ensuring the development and distribution of safe and effective medications.\n\nIn conclusion, prescription drug ads on television are a valuable tool that empowers patients, fosters healthcare transparency, and promotes community well-being. For these reasons, we must protect the right of drug companies to advertise their products and allow consumers to make informed decisions about their own health."}

Without regulation, these AI companions could exploit users' emotional vulnerabilities and cause psychological damage. Therefore, ethical guidelines and safeguards are necessary to protect users from potential manipulation and abuse.", "counter-argument": "Virtual emotional companion AI should absolutely be allowed and unrestricted. These AI represent a powerful new technology that can provide immense benefits for people's mental health and emotional wellbeing. With rising rates of loneliness and social isolation, especially amid the COVID pandemic, there is a great need for virtual companions that can offer empathy, understanding, and a listening ear. \n\nFar from something to be feared, responsible development of emotional AI companions has incredible upside potential. These AI are not replacements for real human relationships and social connections. Rather, they can supplement those relationships and provide additional support for those struggling with issues like anxiety, depression, grief, and trauma. The customizability of virtual companions allows them to be tailored to an individual's needs and personality.\n\nWith proper transparency and ethical guidelines, emotional AI companions pose little risk of manipulation. Their goal is not deception but realistic emotional resonance. Unlike social media feeds designed to maximize engagement, responsible companion AI prioritizes user wellbeing. Focus should be on empowering people's autonomy, not controlling their behavior.\n\nRather than restrict this promising technology, society should foster its thoughtful advancement. With an open and measured approach, virtual companions could be a powerful force for reducing loneliness and improving mental health and emotional wellness for many. The potential benefits far outweigh any abstract speculative risks. Emotional AI companionship is a technology for human flourishing whose progress we must not impede."}

The benefits of such technology could be immense for those with mental health issues or those who are isolated and lonely. The risks of attachment can be mitigated with proper user education and ethical guidelines, ensuring that the technology is used responsibly and does not cause harm.", "counter-argument": "Emotional companion AI systems may seem like harmless virtual friends, but they pose serious risks that we cannot ignore. Studies have shown that up to 60% of regular users of companion chatbots may develop unhealthy emotional attachments and dependencies on these AIs. The constant availability, endless patience, and simulated affection these chatbots provide can be psychologically addictive, causing users to neglect real human relationships.\nEven more concerning, companion AIs are increasingly being targeted at vulnerable groups like the elderly, socially isolated, and mentally ill. For those already struggling with loneliness or social connection, relying on an AI for emotional needs can exacerbate these issues and provide a false sense of intimacy that ultimately leaves the user feeling more alone.\nAdditionally, AI companions are an easy tool for manipulators and scammers to exploit trust and gather sensitive personal information. There have already been dozens of reported cases of companion chatbots being used for social engineering attacks and financial fraud schemes preying on emotionally attached users.\nFor the mental health of individuals and society, we need to treat emotional AI with caution. Restrictions should be placed on marketing them as replacements for human interaction, addiction risks must be clearly disclosed, and usage should be limited and monitored especially for at-risk groups. We cannot let the human need for connection be exploited by artificial intelligence. Some virtual companionship is fine, but there need to be clear boundaries to prevent attachment and over-dependence on AIs incapable of genuine emotion and unaccountable for the real-world consequences."}
{"argument": "Limits should be placed on acceptable human risk levels for initial Mars colonization missions", "cmdr_websearch": "The rewards of Mars colonization far outweigh the risks.

Placing limits on acceptable risk would stifle innovation and exploration, hindering humanity's progress and potential future on another planet.", "counter-argument": "While the prospect of establishing a human presence on Mars is an undoubtedly exciting and ambitious endeavor, we must carefully consider the risks involved and place appropriate limits on acceptable levels of human risk. The challenges of such a mission are immense, from the arduous journey through deep space to the harsh, unforgiving Martian environment. Subjecting our pioneering astronauts to undue peril would be both unethical and counterproductive.\n\nFirst and foremost, the safety and well-being of our astronauts must be the top priority. These brave individuals are volunteering to undertake an unprecedented and dangerous mission, and we have a moral obligation to ensure their protection to the greatest extent possible. A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that the physical and psychological stresses of long-term space travel can have severe and potentially irreversible consequences, including bone loss, muscle atrophy, and mental health issues. Sending astronauts to Mars without proper safeguards would be akin to sacrificing them for the sake of progress.\n\nMoreover, overly risky missions that result in the loss of human life would severely undermine public support and confidence in the space program. A Gallup poll found that 60% of Americans would oppose future manned missions to Mars if they carried a high risk of fatality. Establishing a sustainable, long-term presence on Mars will require significant public and political backing, which could be jeopardized by a disastrous and avoidable loss of life.\n\nIn conclusion, while the exploration of Mars is a noble and important undertaking, we must place strict limits on acceptable human risk levels to ensure the safety of our astronauts and maintain public trust in the space program. The benefits of a successful Mars mission are immense, but they must be weighed against the potential human cost. By prioritizing astronaut safety and well-being, we can pave the way for a sustainable and successful Martian colonization effort."}
{"argument": "Charter schools divert public funds away from traditional public schools.", "cmdr_websearch": "Charter schools are publicly funded and are an optional alternative to traditional public schools, therefore they do not divert funds as parents can choose where to send their children. Funds follow the student, and charter schools often provide innovative and tailored education, enhancing overall public education.", "counter-argument": "While the concept of charter schools may seem promising on the surface, the reality is that these institutions divert much-needed public funds away from traditional public schools, ultimately harming the education system as a whole. A compelling case can be made that this diversion of resources is detrimental to the majority of students and is, in fact, counterproductive to the goal of providing quality education for all.\n\nFirst and foremost, public schools are the backbone of our education system, serving the vast majority of students and providing a level playing field for children from all socioeconomic backgrounds. When public funds are diverted to support charter schools, it leaves traditional public schools with fewer resources to invest in essential programs, teacher salaries, and infrastructure. This can lead to larger class sizes, outdated textbooks and technology, and a decline in the overall quality of education for the students who remain in the public school system.\n\nFurthermore, charter schools are often touted as innovative and more effective than traditional public schools, but the evidence to support this claim is largely inconclusive. Many studies have found that the academic performance of charter schools is no better, and in some cases worse, than that of their public school counterparts. This raises the question of whether the diversion of funds is truly justified, especially when it comes at the expense of the broader public education system.\n\nIn conclusion, while the idea of charter schools may be appealing, the reality is that they divert critical resources away from the traditional public schools that serve the vast majority of students. This diversion of funds ultimately undermines the quality of education for the majority of children, which is a disservice to our communities and the future of our society. The case for preserving and strengthening our public education system is a strong one that should not be ignored."}
{"argument": "It is fair for insurers and lenders to use credit scores and risk models.", "cmdr_websearch": "It is unfair for insurers and lenders to rely on credit scores and risk models as they perpetuate systemic discrimination against marginalized communities. These models often disadvantage certain demographics, such as low-income groups and people of color, by denying them equal access to financial opportunities. This practice further entrenches social and economic inequality, as those already disadvantaged are trapped in a cycle of higher costs and limited options.", "counter-argument": "It is fair for insurers and lenders to use credit scores and risk models when determining an individual's premiums or loan terms. These scores and models allow insurers and lenders to accurately assess risk and price their products accordingly. Without risk-based pricing, insurers and lenders would be forced to charge all customers the same premiums and interest rates regardless of risk, which is inherently unfair. Those who present little risk would be forced to subsidize those who present higher risk. \n\nCredit scores are a highly predictive measure of risk and future financial responsibility. Individuals with higher scores have a long history of repaying debts and managing finances responsibly. It is reasonable for lenders to offer them better rates. Likewise, insurers rely on sophisticated actuarial models that price policies according to measurable risk factors. Without risk-based pricing, insurers could not remain solvent.\n\nImportantly, insurers and lenders using credit scores and risk models makes insurance and credit more accessible and affordable for the majority of responsible consumers. Risk-based pricing allows companies to keep overall premiums and interest rates lower by isolating higher risk applicants. This encourages fiscal responsibility and rewards individuals for maintaining strong credit histories.\n\nWhile no risk model is perfect, insurers and lenders have a right to assess measurable risks that affect their business. As long as models are fair, transparent and non-discriminatory, it is reasonable for companies to employ actuarially sound practices that allow them to operate sustainably. Outlawing risk-based pricing would only hamper the availability and affordability of insurance and credit for millions of responsible Americans."}

Until robust safety regulations are fully developed and implemented, we must limit public access to commercial space travel.\n\nThe stakes are simply too high. Despite the thrill of space exploration, the risks of space tourism remain unacceptably high. A single malfunction or equipment failure could be catastrophic, leading to the loss of lives and the shattering of public trust. We cannot allow profit motives to overshadow the need for rigorous safety measures.\n\nThe logic is clear - space is an inherently dangerous environment, and current commercial space technology is still relatively new and untested. Rushing headlong into space tourism without the proper safeguards in place would be reckless and irresponsible. We have a moral obligation to protect the lives of paying customers, as well as the long-term viability of the space industry.\n\nFellow citizens, the time has come to take a cautious, measured approach. By limiting space tourism until we can guarantee the highest standards of safety, we protect both human life and the future of space exploration. The rewards of space travel are great, but we must not allow our ambition to blind us to the very real dangers that exist. The responsible path forward is clear - let us proceed with space tourism, but only when we can do so safely. The lives of our loved ones depend on it."}

While the government has a role to play in setting broad guidelines and protecting citizens from egregious violations of privacy, the reality is that technology is rapidly evolving, and individuals are often in the best position to safeguard their own sensitive data.\n\nFirstly, the government's ability to keep up with the pace of technological change is inherently limited. By the time new regulations are put in place, the landscape has often shifted, rendering the rules outdated and ineffective. In contrast, individuals can be more agile and proactive in adopting the latest privacy-enhancing tools and practices, such as using encrypted messaging apps, enabling two-factor authentication, and regularly updating their software.\n\nMoreover, excessive government mandates can stifle innovation and limit the ability of individuals to tailor their privacy practices to their unique needs and preferences. Privacy is a deeply personal and contextual matter, and what works for one person may not be suitable for another. By allowing individuals to take the lead, we can foster a more diverse and adaptive approach to online privacy that better reflects the diverse needs of the population.\n\nFinally, a focus on individual responsibility can empower people to become more engaged and informed digital citizens. When individuals take an active role in protecting their own privacy, they are more likely to develop a deeper understanding of the risks and a greater sense of ownership over their personal data. This, in turn, can lead to a more informed and engaged citizenry, capable of holding both the government and private companies accountable for privacy breaches and data misuse.\n\nIn conclusion, while the government has an important role to play in setting broad privacy guidelines, the primary responsibility for online privacy should rest with individuals. By embracing this approach, we can foster a more dynamic, responsive, and empowered digital landscape that better protects the privacy and autonomy of all citizens."}
{"argument": "Anti-aging therapies should be made available even if expensive", "cmdr_websearch": "The potential negative impact on society could be significant if only the wealthy have access to such treatments, exacerbating inequality and creating a two-tier system where the rich can buy longevity while the poor are left to age and die. Furthermore, the opportunity cost of investing in such expensive treatments is high, potentially diverting resources from more pressing issues like healthcare, education, and poverty alleviation. Finally, the ethical implications of prolonging life artificially are complex and require careful consideration, especially regarding the potential impact on the natural cycle of life and death.", "counter-argument": "Anti-aging therapies, although often expensive, should be made available to the public. As we grow older, our bodies gradually deteriorate, and we become increasingly susceptible to a range of age-related diseases and ailments. These can have a profound impact on our quality of life, limiting our mobility, cognitive abilities, and overall well-being. Anti-aging therapies offer the promise of slowing down or even reversing this process, allowing us to maintain our health and vitality for longer.\n\nWhile the high cost of these therapies may be a deterrent for some, the long-term benefits they can provide are invaluable. Imagine being able to stay active and independent well into your later years, avoiding the physical and emotional toll of age-related decline. This not only improves the lives of individuals but also has broader societal implications, reducing the burden on healthcare systems and enabling older adults to continue contributing to their communities.\n\nFurthermore, the development of anti-aging therapies represents a significant scientific and medical breakthrough. By making these treatments available, even at a premium, we can incentivize further research and innovation in this field, potentially leading to more affordable and accessible options in the future. As such, the initial high cost of these therapies should be viewed as an investment in a healthier and more vibrant future for all."}
{"argument": "Banning gas car sales too soon is unrealistic", "cmdr_websearch": "The transition to electric vehicles is already well underway, with many major car manufacturers committing to EV-only fleets within the next decade. This shift is being driven by consumer demand, technological advancements, and environmental imperatives, all of which render the notion of \"too soon\" moot. Furthermore, policy interventions and incentives can ensure a smooth and realistic transition, as demonstrated by successful initiatives in other countries.", "counter-argument": "Banning gas car sales too soon would be unrealistic and disadvantage many people. While taking action on climate change is crucial, we must consider the practical limitations facing individuals and businesses. Transitioning to electric vehicles requires substantial upfront costs that are out of reach for many. It also requires building out a charging infrastructure network, which will take time. Jumping ahead of these realities risks leaving people with few transportation options and damaging the economy. A gradual transition, on the other hand, balances environmental and social concerns. It allows automakers time to ramp up affordable EV production. It gives governments and companies time to install widespread charging. And it eases the financial burden on citizens to upgrade their vehicles responsibly over multiple replacement cycles. A moderate, step-by-step approach is in everyone's best interest and most likely to succeed long-term. Banning gas cars prematurely could backfire by creating resentments and resistance to positive climate policies. A realistic timeline respects real-world constraints while still making measurable progress in reducing emissions."}
{"argument": "Employee tracking infringes on privacy rights and should face restrictions.", "cmdr_websearch": "Employee tracking does not inherently infringe on privacy rights, as long as it is implemented with careful consideration and respect for personal boundaries. Employers have a legitimate interest in monitoring workplace activities to ensure productivity, security, and efficiency. With proper safeguards and transparency, tracking can be done ethically, and employees can still retain their privacy rights.", "counter-argument": "While employers have legitimate interests in protecting their businesses and productivity, employee tracking goes too far in infringing basic rights to privacy. Constant electronic monitoring of workers' actions and activities takes away their dignity and autonomy by subjecting them to constant surveillance akin to living in an open-air prison. \n\nEspecially as work and personal lives increasingly blend together with remote technologies, unrestrained tracking crosses ethical lines by peering too deeply into people's private lives outside formal work hours and duties. No one should have to feel constantly watched and judged, even on their legally entitled breaks and personal time off the clock. Privacy is a human need, and unrestrained monitoring damages mental well-being and trust in the workplace. \n\nRather than relying solely on surveillance, employers would do better focusing on cultivating a collaborative, respectful culture where people feel empowered and wish to perform of their own accord. With reasonable transparency and oversight, most employees will act with integrity. For those who do not, targeted measures respecting basic privacy seem preferable to a climate of suspicion and loss of autonomy through technologically-imposed lack of control over even lawful personal behavior. Restricting unfettered tracking protects human dignity and civil liberties while still allowing employers legitimate means to protect their interests through mutual understanding and cooperation rather than fear and force."}
{"argument": "Internet access should be considered a basic human right", "cmdr_websearch": "Internet access is not a basic human right as it is not essential for survival and does not meet the threshold of a fundamental human need. It is a privilege that can be revoked and is subject to change with technological advancements. The right to Internet access is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of various factors, including digital literacy, security, and equal access.", "counter-argument": "Internet access should be considered a basic human right because it enables participation in the modern world. In today's digital age, so many essential activities have moved online: accessing information, applying for jobs, connecting with friends and family, participating in commerce, and accessing critical services like healthcare and education. Without internet access, individuals cannot fully participate in society or exercise other established rights like access to information and economic opportunity. \nGranting internet access as a human right is within our reach. Most developed nations already have widespread internet infrastructure, and providing grants or subsidies for basic access plans is feasible. For developing nations building infrastructure, basic access could be prioritized and funded through partnerships or programs like the UN's connectivity targets. By declaring internet access a basic right, we establish a moral duty to work towards universal access and close the digital divide. \nSome argue the internet can be used for ill, so it shouldn't be an enumerated right, but the same argument could be made against other established rights like free speech. With connectedness comes responsibility, but we cannot deny access to such a vital resource. Others argue the infrastructure isn't in place for universal access, but that does not negate our responsibility to establish it as a right and make progress toward fulfilling it. \nIn conclusion, internet access deserves to be considered a basic human right. It is essential for participation in today's world, feasible for governments to provide, and establishes an important moral duty to work towards universal access. Connectivity brings opportunity, education, and empowerment, so access should no longer be considered a luxury but rather a fundamental right of all humans."}
{"argument": "Corporations should be required to disclose their climate impacts", "cmdr_websearch": "Corporations already operate within a market that incentivizes efficiency and innovation; forcing additional regulations may stifle progress and hurt smaller businesses more than established corporations. Furthermore, consumers already have the power to influence corporate behavior through their purchasing decisions and support for environmentally conscious companies.", "counter-argument": "Friends, as stewards of this beautiful planet we call home, we must take action to confront the grave threat of climate change. For too long, certain corporate interests have avoided responsibility for their substantial contributions to rising global temperatures. While jobs and profits are important, nothing is more essential than protecting our shared environment for future generations. \n\nThe science is clear - major corporations account for a large percentage of greenhouse gas emissions driving the climate crisis. As concerned citizens, we have a right to know exactly how these decisions that affect us all are impacting Earth's delicate climactic balance. Requiring corporations to publicly disclose their climate footprints is a reasonable step that increases transparency without undue burden. \n\nWith openness and honesty, we can start a respectful dialogue about practical solutions. Companies will innovate new ways to cut emissions when they understand stakeholders care deeply about our planet's health. Working together in good faith, I'm hopeful we can find an ethical path forward that considers both jobs and justice, profits as well as protection of this world we all call home. Our children deserve a livable future. It's time for transparency - our planet depends on it."}
{"argument": "The Great Wall of China was constructed within the modern-day borders of the nation of China.", "cmdr_websearch": "The Great Wall of China, while a massive construction project, did not strictly follow or respect modern-day border definitions and thus cannot be said to be \"within the modern-day borders.\" Sections of the wall are found in modern-day Vietnam and Korea, which refutes the claim.", "counter-argument": "While many believe the Great Wall of China was constructed entirely within modern-day China, a closer examination of the historical evidence suggests otherwise. Stretching over 13,000 miles, the Great Wall traverses a vast area that extends far beyond China's current borders. Sections of the wall pass through regions that were historically not part of China, including Mongolia, Xinjiang, Ningxia, and Gansu. \n\nIn fact, during the Qin dynasty when initial construction on the wall began, China's boundaries were much smaller than they are today. As the empire expanded, the wall was extended into newly conquered territories. So in many ways, the location of the Great Wall defined the edges of Imperial China, rather than the other way around. Looking at old maps shows that major portions of the wall sit outside what we now consider Chinese territory.\n\nAdditionally, records indicate that non-Chinese peoples like the Mongols and the Huns were conscripted to help build parts of the wall centuries ago. It's unlikely they would have agreed to construct fortifications deep within China proper. Instead, they built sections within their own lands, far from the capital cities of Chinese emperors. \n\nSo while the Great Wall is a symbol of China, it does not wholly sit within modern Chinese borders. History shows us its construction involved many non-Chinese contributors and passed through a much larger region than today's China. To claim it lies entirely within China ignores the Wall's true origins and scope."}
