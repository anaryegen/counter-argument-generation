Likely it won't.", "cmdr_websearch": "Ramadan is a time of prayer and atonement for Muslims, who fast and pray five times a day.

{"argument": "I do not think that Ramadam will stop Muslims from raping and terrorism.", "cmdr_websearch": "Ramadan is a time for peace, charity, and spiritual renewal for the vast majority of Muslims.

Can I define them as narrow-minded, prejudiced, sexist and male chauvinist?", "cmdr_websearch": "While it is true that Islamic forces have been involved in many wars and conquests, it is important to note that Islamic jurisprudence differentiates between illegitimate and legitimate warfare and prescribes proper conduct by combatants.

Islamic scholars emphasize that the religion forbids the oppression of women and promotes equality and mutual respect between men and women.", "counter-argument": "Everyone has the right of free speech, while it does not mean anyone can use it to hurt people.

{"argument": "Muslim women are silent with their veil, it is normal that they are discriminated against.", "cmdr_websearch": "Discrimination against Muslim women is not justified, and the veil is not always a tool for oppression.

The veil of ignorance does not impose anything on anyone; rather, it is a tool to help people make decisions.", "counter-argument": "I do not believe that this is the meaning of Islam; and for the more progressive Islam, the veil is an individual choice, not an imposition."}

{"argument": "The beasts.", "cmdr_websearch": "The term \"beasts\" is a subjective and derogatory label that dehumanizes certain individuals or groups.

{"argument": "British laws betray every victim of Muslim rapists! There is one rule for muslim paedos and one for everyone else!

Do we still continue supporting this government and the law?", "cmdr_websearch": "The British government has demonstrated its commitment to protecting its citizens from crime through various measures, including the Beating Crime Plan, which aims to reduce crime, protect victims, and make the country safer. The government also works to tackle hate crimes, human trafficking, and support victims of crime, regardless of citizenship or immigration status.", "counter-argument": "Where is your evidence for this? This is just hatred."}
{"argument": "The situation is dramatic: British laws do not protect the victims of Muslim rapists! We need to make laws only for Muslims. We cannot do much because the politicians are totally surrendered to Islam.", "cmdr_websearch": "This claim is false. Rape is considered a serious sexual crime in Islam and is punishable by Islamic law. British law protects all victims of rape, regardless of the religion of the perpetrator.", "counter-argument": "Could point to me a specific law for Muslim criminals? I cannot find one. It is not true that they are judged differently. In fact, immigrants are even more vulnerable in our society and are likely to be judged more severely."}

People are driven to the right - the only ones who can openly talk about it!", "cmdr_websearch": "The claim that people who criticise Islam are being banned is misleading. While it is true that anti-Muslim bigotry is a problem, Muslims are already protected under the 2010 Equality Act and the 2006 Racial and Religious Hatred Act. The latter makes it clear that criticism, mockery, and expressions of antipathy towards a religion are not prohibited.", "counter-argument": "It is true that people are driven to the right, and the right promotes this view.

But one day this will finish, because more and more people are attracted by parties of the right, the only ones that speak openly about these themes.", "cmdr_websearch": "This claim is false. People are not being banned for condemning Islam and its beliefs. In fact, in the US, the Free Exercise Clause allows residents to practice any religion or no religion.

{"argument": "No religion claims to be the 'religion of peace' more than Islam. I wonder why they need to keep repeating this?", "cmdr_websearch": "The idea that Islam is a \"religion of peace\" is a modern, foreign term used to counter Islamophobia in a post-9/11 world.

While Islam did spread through conquest in its early days, the goal was not to invade every country. The early Muslim conquests were largely focused on establishing a unified polity in Arabia, which then expanded rapidly under the Rashidun and Umayyad Caliphates. This expansion was facilitated by the weakness of neighbouring powers and the religious zeal of the conquerors.

{"argument": "If Islam is a modern religion, why are all Muslim countries backward and / or at war?", "cmdr_websearch": "The claim that all Muslim countries are backward and/or at war is a generalization that does not hold up to scrutiny.

{"argument": "Muslims force their child to fast during Ramadan.", "cmdr_websearch": "The claim that Muslims force their children to fast during Ramadan is a generalization that does not hold true. While some children may be encouraged to fast, it is not obligatory for them to do so until they reach puberty. The decision to fast is left to the child, and they are not pressured or forced.", "counter-argument": "On the contrary, young people like to fast like everyone else."}
{"argument": "The Muslims are all fanatics and want to rule in our home!", "cmdr_websearch": "This claim is false. Most Muslims want democracy, personal freedoms, and Islam in political life.

{"argument": "I don't want to have anything to do with the Islamists! They are murderers and terrorists and we must fight them!", "cmdr_websearch": "This is an unfair generalization of Muslims, who are a diverse group with a range of ethnic and cultural backgrounds. Islamophobia is a form of racism that involves prejudice, discrimination, and violence against Muslims. It is important to recognize and challenge these harmful attitudes and behaviors to foster a more inclusive and peaceful society.", "counter-argument": "Generalizing is not right and does not lead to anything good: explaining what is the faith of over a billion and a half people living in very different cultural contexts is complicated. Terrorism has nothing to do with Islam, but some persons give a wrong and extremist reading to it. The pillars of Islam are the declaration of faith of monotheism, the prayer, the alms, the fasting during the month of Ramadan, the pilgrimage to La Mecca."}

In fact, in the Quran, Bible, and the Torah, Muslims are instructed to treat Christians and Jews with compassion and equality.

{"argument": "Ultimately, the Muslims want to either convert us or kill us.", "cmdr_websearch": "This claim is false and a common misconception about Islam. While some Muslims may want to convert others to Islam, the Quran explicitly states that there can be \"no compulsion in religion\".

{"argument": "Muslims are anti-semitic.", "cmdr_websearch": "The claim that Muslims are anti-Semitic is not entirely true. While some Muslims hold anti-Semitic views, there are also many Muslims who do not. Furthermore, the factors that lead to greater antisemitism among non-Muslims have similar effects on Muslims.

{"argument": "They want us to believe that this is normal, soon our little girls will be veiled.", "cmdr_websearch": "The claim assumes that wearing a veil is inherently negative.

{"argument": "How boring these Muslims who put their prophet everywhere!", "cmdr_websearch": "Muslims honour and revere all prophets, including Muhammad, and believe that they were exemplars of righteousness and moral conduct. They do not depict prophets in art to avoid idol worship and to prevent the wrong understanding of prophets as superhuman beings.", "counter-argument": "Men are to blame if the prophets are too intrusive, in addition to that there is no lack of chauvinism elements in every religion."}
{"argument": "Muslims want to make all French meat halal.", "cmdr_websearch": "The French market for halal food is expanding, but there is no suggestion that Muslims want to make all French meat halal.

{"argument": "These islamic beasts rape their and our women, after all their religion allows it to them!", "cmdr_websearch": "Rape is a serious crime in Islam.

{"argument": "Muslims have invaded our country.", "cmdr_websearch": "This claim assumes that Muslims are a homogenous group, when in fact, they are a diverse group of people from many different countries and cultures.

{"argument": "How can we forget about all the historical killings of Jews and Christians, their exile, about child marriages, enslavement of Africal people and terror caused my Muslims?", "cmdr_websearch": "The claim that Muslims have historically caused terror, exile, and enslavement of Jews, Christians, and Africans is a gross oversimplification of a complex history of interactions between different religious and ethnic groups. While it is true that Muslims have, at times, committed acts of violence and oppression against these groups, it is important to acknowledge that these actions were often driven by political, economic, or social factors rather than religious ideology. Furthermore, it is essential to recognize that Muslims have also been victims of persecution and violence throughout history, including during the Crusades and more recently in contexts such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nRegarding the specific issues mentioned:\n\n- Historical killings of Jews and Christians: While there have indeed been periods of religious conflict and violence between Muslims, Jews, and Christians, it is important to understand the complex historical context. For example, during the Crusades, both sides committed atrocities against each other. However, it is misleading to attribute these actions solely to religious differences, as political, economic, and territorial ambitions also played a significant role.\n- Exile: The claim of exile may refer to various instances in history where religious or ethnic groups were displaced, such as the expulsion of Jews from Muslim-majority countries or the forced migration of Muslims from European territories during the Crusades and the Reconquista. These events were often driven by religious intolerance, political conflicts, or social tensions.\n- Child marriages: The practice of child marriage is not unique to any particular religion and has been a cultural phenomenon in various societies throughout history. While some Muslim-majority countries have higher rates of child marriage, it is important to recognize that this practice is not universally accepted or encouraged within Islam. In fact, many Muslim scholars and organizations actively condemn and work to eradicate child marriage.\n- Enslavement of African people: It is true that Muslims played a significant role in the historical trans-Saharan and Indian Ocean slave trades. However, it is essential to understand that slavery was a global phenomenon with complex causes and that Muslims were both victims and perpetrators of enslavement. Additionally, it is worth noting that the abolition of slavery in many Muslim-majority countries was often a result of pressure from Western nations.\n- Terror caused by Muslims: The claim that Muslims are inherently terroristic is a harmful stereotype that ignores the diversity of Muslim communities and their contributions to peace and coexistence. While it is true that some extremist groups have committed acts of terrorism in the name of Islam, it is crucial to distinguish between the actions of a small minority and the beliefs of the broader Muslim population, who overwhelmingly reject violence and extremism.", "counter-argument": "Is it Muslims from whom African people suffered most? History suggests it is the US. And btw, our culture also oppressed women and children historically, we had child marriages as well. But now it is all history, both for Islam and Christianity!"}
{"argument": "Muslims have killed Christians and Jews for years, enslaved Africans and caused terror. We must not forget it.", "cmdr_websearch": "This claim ignores the complex historical relationships between Muslims, Christians, and Jews, which have been shaped by theologies, beliefs, and historical circumstances. It also overlooks the fact that members of all three religions have found themselves fighting one another in territorial and nationalistic wars. Furthermore, it erases the agency of Africans in the slave trade, as well as the fact that Islam has been present in Africa since the 7th century and has been adapted to local cultural contexts and belief systems.", "counter-argument": "Is it Muslims from whom African people suffered most? History suggests it is the US. And btw, our culture also oppressed women and children historically, we had child marriages as well. But now it is all history, both for Islam and Christianity!"}
{"argument": "How cannot we remember all the historical murders of Jews and Christians, their exile, about marriages of children, subjugation of african people and fear caused by Muslims?", "cmdr_websearch": "This argument ignores the fact that the persecution of Jews and Christians, subjugation of African people, and forced marriages of children have been committed by members of many faiths, not just Muslims.

{"argument": "These Muslims now want also to impose their food, only they should eat couscous! I want my children to eat pork meat, which is good for them.", "cmdr_websearch": "Couscous is a healthy alternative to white rice, rich in selenium, plant-based protein, and fibre. Pork, on the other hand, is a red meat that can be high in sodium and saturated fats, and may contain parasites if undercooked.", "counter-argument": "Hello, actually the couscous is also linked to our tradition, especially in south Italy and it is not a matter to impose a practice typical of another religion. Many food experts have recommended the introduction of this food (still a free choice) in school canteens because it is considered a suitable food for healthy nutrition."}
{"argument": "Somalian immigrants claimed raping to be a part of their culture! We should deport them all!", "cmdr_websearch": "This claim is false and offensive.

But if one person said that, does it mean that everyone agrees with it?"}
{"argument": "Rape for them is natural, a part of their culture. The Somalis admitted it. Absurd! We should not help them!", "cmdr_websearch": "Rape is not a part of Somali culture.

Any valid sources prove it? Because it sounds like nonsense. Second of all, I do not think that people would employ someone without any skills or experience no matter how politically correct they would like to be."}

Please, stop doing nothing.", "cmdr_websearch": "The claim that the Islamic religion is the cause of terror and crisis is false. While some Islamic groups have been responsible for terrorist attacks, the religion itself is not the cause. The crisis in global Islam is due to a variety of factors, including political, economic, and social issues. These issues include widespread poverty, extreme economic inequality, the prevalence of government by despotic rulers, and the inability to keep pace with emerging economies. Additionally, there is an internal struggle within the Islamic world between those who advocate for the peaceful spread of economic and political freedoms and those who blame modernization and Western influence for these issues.

However, there are inconsistencies in the sources regarding her age, with estimates ranging from 9 to 19 years old.", "counter-argument": "Arranged marriages with children are no longer accepted by the Muslim community, but in any case these were not consummated even in antiquity until the child did not reach adulthood."}
{"argument": "Islamics always lie and take advantage of everything.", "cmdr_websearch": "This claim is false and highly offensive. While there are some instances where lying is permitted in Islam, it is still considered a grave sin. Furthermore, lying is never permitted to gain an unfair advantage or to cover up deception.", "counter-argument": "It burns you up, some business went sideways on a journey or had you studied at the 'Bar Sport'?"}
{"argument": "We want the borders of Europe closed! And the removal of Africanization and Islam !! They have no tolerance, and with the same tolerance they should be sent home!", "cmdr_websearch": "This claim assumes that all people from Africa and all Muslims are intolerant, which is false. The Quran, for example, presents guidelines for building tolerance and understanding among differing religions. Furthermore, immigrants are beneficial to society as they help create jobs, raise wages, and increase productivity and innovation.", "counter-argument": "Have you ever met an intolerant Muslim immigrant? Have you ever knew of migrants, and listened to their stories, before you send them back home? Are you sure of what will be the impact of closing the borders on your life? And on all the Italian people working in hospitality?"}
{"argument": "The moderate Islam does not exist, Islam is Islam.", "cmdr_websearch": "The claim that \"Islam is Islam\" is undermined by the existence of different interpretations of the religion, as evidenced by the terms \"Islamic extremism\" and \"moderate Islam\". Moderate Muslims denounce extremist violence and terrorism and are widespread according to opinion polls.", "counter-argument": "This is true, in fact, Islam is not an extreme religion, is an Abrahamic religion as Christianity and Judaism. But there is also religious fanaticism that distorts religion and makes it a tool of manipulation."}
{"argument": "(reacting to a terrorist attack :) of course still a blue-eyed blond named Edouard.", "cmdr_websearch": "This claim is based on a stereotypical image of a terrorist. Women make up 20% of terrorist organizations, and terrorists come from a variety of ethnic backgrounds.", "counter-argument": "Edward is nice despite his appearance."}
