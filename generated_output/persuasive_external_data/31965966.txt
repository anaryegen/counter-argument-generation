Is It Time To Require Identity Verification For Everyone Using Social Media?

Marketing has a problem. A big problem. Social media has become weaponized. And, while this weaponization poses serious threats to our country in the long term, the short term threat is to social media itself. Russia has poisoned the well, we know that now. And while the FBI and Justice Department play whack-a-mole on the back end of the spectrum finding and cleaning out false posts from these Russian social-ops teams and bots, it may be time for robust identity verification on the front end.

Social media is too powerful now to be anonymous.

Time was, Facebook lived up to the cliche of being full of cat videos and pictures of our kids. The only complaint we had about it was the social pressure it put people under reading the seemingly endless good news from all of their friends. Sounds quaint now.

It was a more innocent time, to be sure. But brands loved it because social media facilitated valuable “word of mouth.” Users loved it because it was an easy and fun way to stay at least superficially connected to friends over time.

But then Russia, being Russia, took advantage of an innocent but significant social media loophole: the complete lack of identity accountability. Not that it’s terribly original to create fake social media accounts. My older kids have been doing it for years creating “Finsta” accounts (fake Instagram) with fake names where they can post what’s really happening in their lives, safe from parental and future employer eyes.

Fact is, anyone can create a page and put anyone’s name to it with no accountability. Which doesn't matter much when social media is about cat videos and pictures of kids - or even fake teenage “Finsta” accounts. But when another country uses it to divide us it matters a lot.

We make 16 year olds get licenses to drive because driving safely matters. We don’t allow kids under 21 to drink alcohol because drinking responsibly matters. In many states, we don’t allow people to carry handguns without a license or permit because a gun in the wrong hands is a danger to us all.

We now can plainly see that words can be used as weapons. And this CMO Forum knows all too well how powerful the right words can be in influencing people to buy this product over that one. Influencing what people think is perhaps the most valuable geopolitical currency there is.

But Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, through no fault of their own, have become weapons of another state against this one. We can no longer just sit back and allow this to happen, nor can we expect the FBI or Justice Department to catch every fake person or every fake post. Like a car, alcohol or a gun, we need to treat social media in a way that respects the power its users can wield, good or, more importantly, bad.

Some form of identity verification in social media would guarantee that every account is linked to a registered user. Call it a license or a permit or whatever. But each user must register with a real name, a real address, be issued an account number and perhaps a secret code. Not unlike the security surrounding credit cards today. Without it, you can’t open a Facebook or Twitter or Instagram or YouTube account.

According to Forbes Contributor, Emma Woollacott, Facebook is making some moves to combat fake political posts from foreign entities, in her “Facebook's Brilliant Answer To Election Meddling: Making Russian Ad Buyers Get A US Postal Address.”

A US postal address is a start. But it sounds easy to get around and doesn’t go nearly far enough.

It’s in every marketer’s interest to demand identity verification.

Social media must continue to thrive. It’s the greatest invention since television when it comes to marketing because it allows people to spread the word about our brands and products for us (among many other things). And it puts healthy pressure on us as companies because now we are held accountable by people on social media and in realtime. Nothing spreads like wildfire like news of a product letdown, right?

But if people can’t trust what’s on social media because the people posting might be some Russian troll paid by the Kremlin to dismantle our culture, then the entire platform of “social media” becomes a threat to our security. And threats to our security tend to become illegal.

So, let’s fix it before Russia puts the fix on us.

It's time to demand that social media platforms worry less about "fake news" and more about who, exactly, is posting in the first place. It's time to invent a way to verify the identity of everyone on their platforms, perhaps integrated with citizen-identification systems already used by our government and other governments around the world. One person, one page. One business, one page. When they roll out this new verification system, make everyone log out and then re-register before they can post again.

Will it keep Russians from spreading lies? No. But it will at least hold these people - and everyone else - accountable to their posts and increase the odds that a mole gets whacked when the FBI does its thing on the other end of the spectrum.

Long live social media.
