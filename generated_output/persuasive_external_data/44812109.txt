Disclosure in business can be a tricky thing. On the one hand, businesses are required to disclose certain aspects of their management practices and financial performance if they wish to secure funding or have their stock traded on an exchange. On the other hand, disclosing too much information can weaken a business’s competitive advantage. While there are general guidelines, accounting and legal standards establish pretty clear disclosure rules for business. When evaluating or preparing financial disclosures, consult with a certified public accountant or attorney.

In regards to general standards regarding disclosure, the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) has established guidelines for publicly traded companies that apply to all businesses. The purpose of disclosure is to make current and future investors aware of the financial risks that the business faces. With that in mind, a business should evaluate all information available regarding its current and future fiscal performance. If the current situation suggests a possible trend or future event, but it is something unlikely to occur, the business does not have to disclose. However, if the trend is likely to occur or the business cannot determine if it is likely, the business must disclose the possibility and the underlying facts. The one exception to this is if the event is likely to occur, but is unlikely to have a material impact on the business’s financial status. In that case, the business need not disclose.

All financial statements prepared in the United States, whether for publicly or privately traded business, must conform to the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Part of GAAP principles is full disclosure. Between the statements and the footnotes, which are more detailed explanations of the financial data, a business is required to share all information that may affect an investor’s ability to read the statements or make a financial decision. In the footnotes you must disclose information about future events as well as descriptions as to how certain elements of the statements were calculated.

Statutory Requirements

Often times the federal government may create regulations that require businesses to disclose certain information. An example is the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Sarbanes-Oxley requires that businesses make certain disclosures about how the data presented in financial reports is produced to ensure that the data was properly gathered and reported. This disclosure is meant to assure prospective investors that the financial information provided is accurate.

Some elements of a business are not only not required to be disclosed, but are actually protected from dissemination. Trade secrets refer to specific processes, methods, plans, formulas or other similar bits of data that differentiate a product or service for others. The formula for Coca Cola and the recipe for Kentucky Fried Chicken are just a few examples of well-known trade secrets. To be classified as a trade secret, the Uniform Trade Secret Act requires that the information in question must be valuable due in part to it not being widely known and that reasonable efforts are taken to maintain the information’s secrecy. If someone seeks to disclose a trade secret, the business may file an injunction preventing that person from disseminating the information and may sue if the injunction is violated.
