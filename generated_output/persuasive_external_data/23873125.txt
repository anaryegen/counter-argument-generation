What is Pharmacovigilance?

Medicines and vaccines have transformed the prevention and treatment of diseases. In addition to their benefits, medicinal products may also have side effects, some of which may be undesirable and / or unexpected. Pharmacovigilance is the science and activities relating to the detection, assessment, understanding and prevention of adverse effects or any other medicine/vaccine related problem. 

All medicines and vaccines undergo rigorous testing for safety and efficacy through clinical trials before they are authorized for use. However, the clinical trial process involves studying these products in a relatively small number of selected individuals for a short period of time. Certain side effects may only emerge once these products have been used by a heterogenous population, including people with other concurrent diseases, and over a long period of time.

The WHO PIDM in Focus - Building a global community

Since it was established in 1968, the WHO Programme for International Drug Monitoring (WHO PIDM) has sought to put medicines and vaccine safety at the heart of global healthcare. UMC's role in education and training, the development of pharmacovigilance tools, and as the custodian of VigiBase – the WHO global database of adverse event reports for medicines and vaccines – is integral to the WHO PIDM. For almost 50 years, UMC has worked side by side with WHO to fulfil its mission, putting patient safety front and centre. This film tells that story.

Workshop: Value of social media and other online listening posts in Pharmacovigilance

A hybrid meeting was planned in Geneva, on the margins of the UMC Board meeting in September 2023, to consider expanding the use of various social media and other online sources of information used during the pandemic and discuss if and how these sources could complement routine pharmacovigilance work and serve as platforms for optimizing safety communication.

The meeting report as well as the questions of the participants in the chat box are available.

Results of Literature Review and Survey of COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Assessment Activities

In 2021, there was an urgent need to support the COVAX Vaccine Safety Working Group (VSWG), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and the WHO-Pharmacovigilance team (WHO-PV) in collating the studies evaluating the safety of COVID-19 vaccines globally to inform strategy and policy. A landscape assessment of COVID-19 vaccine safety surveillance activities, including a literature review and a survey, was conducted to inform on potential sources of evidence and to identify gaps: VH Safety Maps.

The WHO Pharmacovigilance team strives to ensure safer use of medicines and vaccines throughout the life cycle of the products. We produce reliable, balanced information on the benefits and risks of medicines and vaccines, which enhances people’s care and safety.

Team Lead: Dr Shanthi Pal

Team Lead, Pharmacovigilance

Among our activities we are:

Developing norms, standards and guidelines.

Providing credible safety and regulatory information on medicines.

Appointing and convening global advisory committees of experts to review and provide guidance on the safety of medicines and vaccines.

Hosting global networks such as the WHO Programme for International Drug Monitoring (PIDM) to promote pharmacovigilance in countries.

Establishing and maintaining WHO Collaborating centres (WHO CCs) to provide technical support to countries in pharmacovigilance.

Countering vaccine-misinformation about vaccines through the Vaccine Safety Net (VSN), which facilitates the access to reliable information on vaccine safety.

Providing training programmes to build and strengthen the capacity of national safety surveillance systems for medicines and vaccines .

Developing innovative methods and tools to generate new evidence on the safety of medicinal products
