The increasing use of drones for commercial purposes has become one of the biggest emerging threats to the future of airplane safety, according to Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty (AGCS).

The expected rise in the use of drones or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for a host of different applications may leave operators exposed to a whole new set of risks, including third-party damage or injury and liability, according to AGCS’s Global Aviation Safety Study.

One of the biggest risks, it said, was from radio frequency interference, resulting in loss of control, and, in the worst cases, fatalities.

Other problems include invasion of privacy, aerial surveillance and data collection.

“With the ability to collect massive amounts of unsolicited data, UAVs present an enormous threat to individual privacy and a significant challenge for insurance carriers,” said Vikki Stone, senior vice president at Poms & Associates Insurance Brokers.

“In drafting policies, it is crucial for carriers to know how such information will be used,” she said.

The production of UAVs has increased by double-digits year-on-year since 2007, according to AGCS, with applications ranging from news gathering and surveillance to sporting events and crop dusting.

The benefits are obvious — the vehicles are smaller and generally easier to operate, particularly in hazardous environments, as well as have lower maintenance and running costs than conventional aircraft.

Such has been the take-up that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) estimates that by 2020, there will be about 30,000 small commercial unmanned aircraft in our skies.

However, coverage is limited, with only about 21 insurers and those that do offer policies have been hampered by a lack of historical and analytical data, the study said.

“Annual utilization, number of accidents and repair costs are not readily available and unmanned aircraft are not presently flying at the rate that they will be in the near future in the national airspace,” the report said.

Another problem is that, despite FAA plans to integrate UAVs into the U.S. airspace in 2015, there is a “lack of international, regional and local regulations for the safe operation of UAVs,” said Henning Haagen, AGCS’s global head of aviation EMEA and Asia Pacific.

Stone said that the No. 1 concern among carriers was the lack of certification of UAV pilots. That lack, she said, makes it prohibitive to get any kind of coverage at all.

“I think the bigger problems are going to be the people that don’t follow the guidelines required, so ultimately we’ll end up a number of rogue flyers out there — that’s the scary part,” she said.

Peter Schmitz, CEO of global aviation specialty at Aon, outlined other major risks of drones.

“The biggest threat is clearly the taking down of a major aircraft in a mid-air collision,” he said.

“The second issue is the application of these vehicles in urban areas where the risk of damage to properties and individuals is much greater than it would be in rural parts.”

David Williams, assistant professor of aerospace and occupational safety at Embly-Riddle Aeronautical University, said the scale of the damage caused by a mid-air collision was almost incomprehensible.

“These units [UAVs] would cause catastrophic damage if they were to collide with an aircraft,” he said.

Underwriting Challenges

Schmitz said that regulatory authorities across the world face an uphill task in getting to grip with these issues because UAVs are still a relatively new and unknown quantity in terms of repair costs and loss ratios.

“I think that a couple of years down the road, the FAA will have a much clearer picture of the types of risks involved and will be better able to police these kind of aircraft,” he added.

Patton Kline, senior vice president in Marsh’s aviation and space group, said another issue facing carriers was insuring the value of the whole asset.

“From an underwriter’s view,” he said, “the biggest perceived risks are both on the liability side as well as insuring the whole value of the asset, which tends to be much more difficult as there are a whole range of platforms, many of which are still unproven.

“There’s also a lot of debate right now about whether underwriters are going to step up to cover things like privacy and it’s likely that even if they do, we’ll continue to see exclusions in policies for these types of losses.

“Another big issue we foresee is in products liability, with litigators going after large manufacturers of drones with deep pockets in the event of any future accidents.”

Kline estimated that, while losses from UAVs were still in the “small single digits,” rapid year-on-year growth means that number is expected to expand in future years.

Stone added: “I think we’ll see more carriers throw their hat in the ring and because the pricing is so competitive at the moment; often the only way to distinguish yourself is through enhanced coverage forms.”

A recent government white paper reported that the increased use of unmanned aircraft by the U.S. Air Force had resulted in a dramatic rise in the percentage of non-combat accidents ending in death, permanent total disability or damage of at least $1 million between 2003 and 2013.

Of those 75 accidents, UAVs accounted for about 21 percent. By 2011, that figure had increased to 50 percent, however, it has improved over the last two years.

The AGCS report also said that, while technical advances have reduced the risk of dying in a plane crash, the reliance on computers has left the industry open to the threat of cyber attacks.

“Cyber terrorism may replace the hijacker and bomber and become the weapon of choice on attacks against the aviation community,” the report said.

The study said that less than two out of every 100 million passengers died on commercial flights this year, compared to 133 deaths in the 1960s.

But despite improved safety, the cost of claims is still rising, driven by the widespread use of new materials in plane design, as well as tighter regulations and increased litigation, the report said.

AGCS also estimates that the insured value of airline fleets will climb to more than $1 trillion in the next five years, from less than $900 billion this year.

Dangerous Jobs: Why Health Screenings Are Critical to Protect Firefighters

The implementation of an annual wellness-fitness program can improve firefighter fitness and ultimately help save lives.

By: Concentra | May 1, 2024

It’s impossible to ignore the great risks taken by firefighters. They experience injuries in large numbers and there is significant loss of life. Almost half of this loss of life is due to cardiovascular events. Additionally, studies suggest that there is an increased risk of the development of certain cancers.

These brave men and women put their lives on the line to rescue and protect others. They won’t hesitate to run into a burning building while wearing heavy gear and carrying heavy equipment in order to save lives.

“​​Their job requires a combination of performance, mobility, strength and endurance, and it often exposes them to environmental hazards and psychosocial hazards as well,” said Dr. Latha Brubaker, senior vice president of medical operations at Concentra.

“Being a firefighter can be physically difficult, it can be dangerous, and the impact of fighting fires and rescue can have a behavioral health impact, as well.”

Given the physical and emotional challenges associated with their jobs, firefighters need to be in top physical condition. Regular holistic health screenings and preventive conditioning programs can help protect these heroes, ensuring they have long careers serving their communities.

Dr. Latha Brubaker, Senior Vice President Medical Operations at Concentra

To understand the physical and mental health threats firefighters face, it’s important to examine how firefighting exposes them to a number of different risks. Their job is physically taxing. They must wear heavy gear to protect them from high-temperature exposure while rescuing people and pets. They have to climb ladders and stairs during rescue operations. Although wearing masks to limit these exposures, firefighters can inhale smoke and be exposed to harmful chemicals and environmental toxins, increasing their risk of certain cancers.

“Firefighters have to climb ladders and stairs, all the while hauling very heavy and unruly fire hoses and wearing very heavy equipment and PPE,” Brubaker said.

While completing these physically demanding tasks, firefighters can inhale smoke and other environmental toxins, increasing their risks of certain cancers. A study of 30,000 firefighters spanning from 1950 to 2009 found that firefighters were 9% more likely to be diagnosed with cancer and 14% more likely to die from the disease than the general population.

Outside of the physically taxing elements, firefighters often work in distressing circumstances. There may be thoughts of the personal risks taken to save others. They witness significant injuries and loss of life.

All of these situations have the potential to be emotionally distressing for firefighters. That’s why a number of states — including California, Tennessee, Florida and Georgia — have passed or are considering passing laws that include PTSD benefits under workers’ comp coverage for firefighters.

“We’ve really doubled down on our commitment to behavioral health, and we’ve gone so far as to partner with some third-party resources that have expanded our ability to provide behavioral health support,” said Chris Studebaker, senior director of onsite preventive services at Concentra.

Protecting Firefighter Health

Unlike in other professions, it’s hard to reduce the number of physical and environmental hazards a firefighter faces on the job. Yes, PPE can go a long way in protecting firefighters from burns and other injuries, but the physical demands are also extreme. Firefighters are wrangling heavy fire hoses to stop the damage. In addition, they are often lifting people and maneuvering in confined or challenging spaces.

In order to make sure firefighters are up to the task, many departments conduct annual physical health assessments so that they can be certain their firefighters are physically and mentally prepared for the job. Medical personnel follow the guidelines provided by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standard 1582 on Comprehensive Occupational Medicine Programs for Fire Departments which helps them determine if there is a condition present that may prevent a firefighter from performing their essential job functions.

The Joint Labor Management Wellness-Fitness Initiative, comprised of two major fire service organizations, worked to develop a comprehensive wellness-fitness program. Based on this initiative, NFPA developed standards regulating these programs. This resulted in the suggestion of adding cancer screening, fitness assessments, and behavioral health screening to the periodic health assessments of firefighters.

“Some fire departments are now asking us to perform cancer screening,” Brubaker said. “Cancer screening recommendations are made by the US Preventive Services Task Force, for example, and are based on a systematic review of scientific evidence published in peer-reviewed journals. When determining the appropriate screening tests, it is important to review the USPSTF recommendations with the understanding of the potential additional risks amongst firefighters for certain cancers.

Sleep health is another area of issue in the fire service due to the 24 or 48-hour shift schedule and the mental strain and stress of the job.

Beyond screenings, firehouses can opt to partner with providers of on-site health services, including physical therapists who can work collaboratively with employers to develop and implement injury-prevention programs. Known as “tactical athlete programs” because their rigor is like that of the training a pro athlete would undergo, these solutions can help catch injuries before they become severe and help keep firefighters’ bodies functioning optimally to enable them to perform their job.

Wearable technologies, too, are likely to play a role in keeping firefighters safe in the future: “We’re seeing the use of wearable tech sensors that look at environmental exposures and heat. And now the technologies can even track their sleep health” Studebaker said. “I think the future of wearable tech is going to shift away from discrete individual devices and more towards garment-based sensors.”

A Trusted Partner for Firefighter Physicals

The physical rigor required to fight fires combined with the emotional stressors present in the job mean that employers need to put extra care into guarding firefighters’ health and safety. Firefighters should undergo regular physical exams, and Concentra is just the partner they need to conduct these physicals.

Concentra clinicians perform examinations, imaging, and lab tests that meet the National Fire Protection Association standards.

Firefighters who undergo these examinations will complete a physical fitness test that assesses their lifting, pushing, pulling, carrying, climbing and other abilities. These kinds of assessments can guard against musculoskeletal injuries common in the industry.

Should an injury occur, the clinician utilizes a conservative treatment approach, with an emphasis on active rehabilitation. Since firefighters are in safety sensitive positions, opioids are usually avoided.

“​​Musculoskeletal injuries can be managed without the use of opioids,” Brubaker said. “Our approach is a conservative one with the use of physical therapy, when appropriate, and anti-inflammatory medication, if needed. We try to avoid prescribing opioids. Opioids are typically unnecessary.”

A Concentra clinician will perform lab tests including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, lipid panel, and urinalysis as well as TB tests. They will do alcohol and drug tests. They will perform audiograms, pulmonary function tests, chest X-rays and EKGs. They will complete a cardiovascular risk assessment and depending on age and the level of risks, a stress test will be performed either at the onsite clinic or a cardiology office.

“It’s important for us to make sure in the first place that they’re healthy from a cardiovascular perspective, that they’re healthy from a respiratory perspective,” Studebaker said.

Behavioral health screening and cancer screening can be performed at Concentra Onsite Health clinics. Clinicians can conduct screenings for six cancers firefighters are at elevated risk for: colorectal, prostate, skin, blood, thyroid and bladder.

Concentra Onsite Health clinicians assess firefighters’ health holistically — something that is essential for a job that is both physically and emotionally taxing. By providing whole-person care, Concentra Onsite Health aims to guard firefighters’ health so that they can come home to their families after a day of protecting others.

“Most firefighters are very passionate about the work they do. They are vital members of their community and take risks every day to keep these communities safe. The work of a firefighter can have an adverse impact on their long-term health and well-being. It is equally vital that we take care of our firefighters and do what we can to improve their overall health.”
