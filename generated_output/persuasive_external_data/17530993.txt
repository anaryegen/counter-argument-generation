The Recreational UAS Safety Test (TRUST)

The Recreational UAS Safety Test (TRUST) provides education and required online testing for recreational drone pilots on important safety and regulatory topics. If you plan to fly your drone under The Exception for Recreational Flyers, you must complete TRUST first. Note that you need both a recreational registration and TRUST in order to legally fly your drone in the national airspace.

TRUST is divided into 4 sections:

Requirements What it means to fly recreationally, types of airspace, restrictions, and authorizations.

Preparation Pre-flight activities, weather, obstacles, distractions, and flight path.

Safety Community Based Organizations, visual line of sight, first person view (FPV), and obstacle avoidance.

Limitations Knowing your UAS, connection/signal strength, automated features, and practice flights.

After each section, you will answer a series of multiple choice and true/false questions. If you answer incorrectly, you will see an explanation and be given an opportunity to select the correct answer.
