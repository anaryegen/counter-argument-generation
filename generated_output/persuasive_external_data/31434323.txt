College Athletes Can Now Be Paid. But Not All of Them Are Seeing Money. Is That Fair?

A Supreme Court ruling allows student athletes to be compensated. Should those who are raking in the money have to share it with their teammates?

Do you follow college sports? Did you know that college athletes can now make money? They are not paid by their colleges or universities, but they can receive gifts from boosters; make deals with companies to use their names, images and likenesses; and endorse products.

What do you think about that? If you play a sport, would you like to play in college someday? Do you think you could make money doing it?

In “Student. Athlete. Mogul?” Bruce Schoenfeld wrote about changes made in July 2021 to the rules that govern collegiate athletics that allow student athletes to earn money from corporate sponsorships and to accept money from supporters. But few players, he writes, are seeing any of it:

For more than a century, or as long as the N.C.A.A. has presided over college sports, athletes had no legal way to earn anything more tangible from their achievements than plaques and trophies. The rules were as clear as they were strict: Players couldn’t receive any benefits linked to their participation in a sport. Over the years, football and men’s basketball have come to generate billions of dollars for television networks, corporate sponsors and universities. Seven-figure salaries for coaches have become common. The players, however, could get nothing beyond a free — often perfunctory — education.

That changed on July 1, 2021. Following a Supreme Court decision against the N.C.A.A., the organization ended nearly all its restrictions on what athletes could earn from the use of their names, images and likenesses, an amorphous category that has become known as N.I.L. Overnight, those athletes could make deals with companies and endorse their products. They could even accept money from boosters — usually longtime donors, or local businessmen with ties to a university — in transactions that previously would have led to severe sanctions against their teams. Around the country, administrators were astonished by the abrupt reversal. “It’s not a hole in the dike,” is how Vince Ille, a senior associate athletic director, describes the N.C.A.A.’s change of course. “It’s the obliteration of the entire dam.”
