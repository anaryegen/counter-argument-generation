1 Benefits of tenure

One of the main benefits of tenure is that it allows scholars to pursue their research interests and agendas without fear of losing their jobs or facing retaliation. This can foster intellectual diversity, creativity, and originality in academic fields. Tenured faculty can also challenge conventional wisdom, question authority, and advocate for social change, which can enhance the public role and relevance of academia. Moreover, tenure can attract and retain talented and qualified researchers who value stability, autonomy, and recognition.

Tenure is a small check against malicious administrators. It allows people to occasionally speak out. It provides some job security. Historically it meant that some form of shared governance was possible. And that a certain level of civility existed because people had to live with each other. But the rise of an administrative class that lacks any commitment to academic values, together with metrics, has eliminated this and made universities toxic environments. Fear is everywhere and for good reason. â€¦see more

Can you imagine if we applied the same concept of tenure to other professional spheres of work? Pilots, doctors, lawyers? Uncertain employment makes people want to move to other jobs. Uncertain employment causes discrimination and stress for those with challenging life circumstances, eg illness. Tenure is dignity, tenure is creating a work environment in which you can focus on what you love doing, and not on merely surviving. â€¦see more

Academic tenure is a system of job security that provides professors and researchers with long-term employment contracts and protects them from arbitrary dismissal without just cause. The goal of tenure is to protect academic freedom and encourage the pursuit of knowledge without fear of retribution or censorship. While academic tenure can have both positive and negative effects on research quality and innovation, its overall impact may depend on a variety of factors, such as the specific academic discipline, the culture of the institution, and the individual motivations of the researchers involved. â€¦see more

2 Challenges of tenure

On the other hand, tenure can also pose some challenges and risks for research quality and innovation. One of the common criticisms of tenure is that it reduces the incentives and accountability of faculty to produce high-quality and impactful research. Some argue that tenure can create a culture of complacency, mediocrity, and resistance to change, as tenured faculty may have less motivation to update their skills, collaborate with others, or engage with new ideas and methods. Additionally, tenure can limit the flexibility and diversity of academic institutions, as they may have less room to hire, fire, or promote faculty based on their performance, needs, or goals.

I will bravely say what others won't about tenure. Tenure produces dysfunctional behavioral by-products in employees that wreck havoc in the workplace. It diminishes academic resources and produces inequality. What is it about these specific employees and their work that is deemed so contentious they would need such extraordinary employment protection, while the work of others deemed so invaluable they are not worthy of said protection? The security of being forever employed produces a power dynamic bringing out the worst in human beings. The negative behavior from tenured professionals that I have both witnessed and personally experienced are bullying, elitism, laziness, hoarding, and discrimination. Tenure should be reevaluated. â€¦see more

Tenure is a symptom of a very problematic false dichotomy in academia. The first question we must ask is: What is the purpose of higher education? If our goal is the furthering of research, like research one facilities, then tenure offers the researchers moving knowledge forward a safe harbor to take risks in their research. But if our goal is to educate students, then tenure as it currently exists for accreditation relies on the above role for instructors and not on their primary role of educating students. We need to redesign the system to facilitate the diversity that exists within higher Ed. Researchers should get tenure for research and instructors, who are still an important part of the university, deserve the same benefits/pay â€¦see more

3 Alternatives to tenure

Given the mixed effects of tenure on research quality and innovation, some have proposed or implemented alternative models of academic employment and evaluation. For example, some institutions have adopted a system of post-tenure review, which requires tenured faculty to undergo periodic assessments of their research productivity, quality, and impact. This can provide feedback, recognition, and support for faculty, as well as identify and address any problems or deficiencies. Another option is to replace tenure with renewable contracts, which offer faculty a fixed-term employment with the possibility of renewal based on their achievements, contributions, and goals. This can create more flexibility, diversity, and dynamism in academic staffing and research.

Faculty members are evaluated annually by tenure and promotion departmental and faculty wide committees that submit their recommendations to the Deans and President of the University. Students evaluate their instructors in every course. The issue is not lack of continuous evaluation after tenure, it is often about how these evaluations are conducted and what criteria they follow, if you are not part of a clique and unwilling to tow the line, you can be punished. I participated in many appeal cases where a faculty member is unjustly rewarded or promoted for speaking her mind or unwilling to bow their heads to authority â€¦see more

In the workforce, a great way to improve a jobs stability and benefits as well as challenge changes in working conditions is through representation. In the United States, workers who have been represented by a labor union have seen improved working conditions, to include pursuit of collective and independent interests without fear of reprisal. In addition, members represented by a labor union can challenge conventional wisdom, openly question authority, and advocate for social change, especially in union executive roles. Labor unions have a place in the workplace, irrespective of industry. They are an effective means to equalize the relationship between labor and management. â€¦see more

4 Implications for researchers

Whether tenure is beneficial or detrimental for research quality and innovation depends largely on how it is implemented, regulated, and perceived by academic institutions and faculty. Tenure can provide security, freedom, and prestige for researchers, but it can also create complacency, rigidity, and isolation. Therefore, researchers who seek or have tenure should be aware of the opportunities and responsibilities that come with it. They should strive to maintain their curiosity, creativity, and excellence in their research, as well as their engagement, collaboration, and service to their academic community and society.

La mise en place de permanences universitaires est un outil essentiel pour soutenir la recherche et l'innovation. En permettant aux chercheurs d'avoir un espace dÃ©diÃ© et un soutien constant, cela favorise leur productivitÃ© et leur crÃ©ativitÃ©. De plus, ces permanences offrent aux chercheurs l'occasion d'Ã©changer et de collaborer avec leurs pairs, ce qui peut conduire Ã  de nouvelles idÃ©es et Ã  des projets novateurs. Il est donc important de reconnaÃ®tre l'importance de ces permanences et de les soutenir financiÃ¨rement et logistiquement pour garantir une recherche de qualitÃ© et une vÃ©ritable innovation. â€¦see more

President at Econometric Research Limited

Quite often Faculty are assumed to be manipulated by dollars and cents. The urge to publish and to do so annually undermines innovation and good quality research a lot more profoundly than tenure. It forces professors, particularly those that are risk averse to seek quick results and minor adjustments to what was published avoiding risky subjects and uncertain outcomes, the latter are at the very core of innovation and creativity. It is not tenure that results in mediocrity, it is the relentless pressure to publish and follow the herd. â€¦see more

5 Implications for policy makers

Policy makers who influence or oversee the academic tenure system should also consider its effects on research quality and innovation. They should balance the need to protect and promote academic freedom and excellence with the need to ensure accountability and responsiveness to the changing needs and challenges of higher education and society. They should also support and encourage academic institutions and faculty to adopt and adapt best practices and standards for research evaluation, development, and dissemination. Furthermore, they should foster a culture of trust, respect, and dialogue among different stakeholders and perspectives in the academic sector.

La permanence universitaire dans la recherche et l'innovation implique l'utilisation de mÃ©thodes telles que la revue par les pairs, l'accÃ¨s ouvert aux donnÃ©es et la transparence. Ces outils permettent aux dÃ©cideurs de prendre des dÃ©cisions Ã©clairÃ©es en se basant sur des rÃ©sultats solides et reproductibles. Cependant, cela peut Ã©galement affecter la qualitÃ© de la recherche et de l'innovation en ralentissant le processus dÃ©cisionnel et en limitant la crÃ©ativitÃ© des scientifiques. Il est donc essentiel de trouver un Ã©quilibre entre la permanence universalitÃ© et la nÃ©cessitÃ© d'avancer rapidement dans la recherche et l'innovation. â€¦see more

I am a tenured professor. I came to higher education later in my career. The idea of tenure was foreign to me. Guaranteed employment? Why? I certainly see benefits to it. As an academic and researcher, you may study and say things that administration, donors or trustees don't agree with. That said, I have seen my share of tenured faculty who use tenure as an excuse to do nothing more than teach (I am not at an R1 institution) and sadly, not even do that well. I would not say that is the majority. I do favor a different model to tenure like a union-focused approach mentioned in this discussion. â€¦see more
