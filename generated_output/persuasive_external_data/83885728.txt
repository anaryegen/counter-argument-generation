It allows nations to unite, pooling resources, knowledge, and expertise towards a common goal. Such a global effort can act as a unifying force, promoting international peace and collaboration and setting a precedent for how humanity can work together to solve grand challenges [9], [15].

The multifaceted rationale for colonizing Mars underscores its significance as a milestone in human evolution. It represents an amalgamation of survival strategy, scientific inquiry, technological prowess, economic potential, cultural inspiration, and international cooperation. As we set our sights on this red neighbor in our solar system, Mars colonization emerges not just as a feasible venture but as a necessary step in the journey of human progress and survival.

1.2. Current challenges

While the allure of Mars is compelling, the challenges of establishing a sustainable human presence on the Red Planet are formidable and multifaceted [10]:

Vast Distance from Earth: The immense distance between Earth and Mars presents significant logistical and communication challenges. Resupply missions to Mars would be infrequent, take months to reach the planet, and require precise planning and significant resources [21]. Communication with Earth would also be subject to non-negligible latency, ranging from 4 to 24 minutes one way. This delay impacts personal communication and mission control operations, requiring a high degree of autonomy for Mars settlers [22].

Thin Atmosphere and Lack of Magnetosphere: Mars' thin atmosphere, composed primarily of carbon dioxide, provides minimal protection from harmful cosmic and solar radiation [23]. The absence of a global magnetosphere further exposes the surface to high radiation levels, posing significant risks to human health, including increased cancer risks, radiation sickness, and potential genetic damage [24]. This necessitates the development of advanced radiation shielding for habitats, spacesuits, and any surface activities.

Extreme Temperatures and Reduced Atmospheric Pressure: The Martian environment is characterized by extreme temperatures, with daily fluctuations ranging from relatively mild temperatures to well below freezing [5]. The reduced atmospheric pressure, less than 1% of Earth's at sea level, makes it impossible for humans to survive without pressurized habitats and spacesuits. These conditions require robust and reliable life support systems that can regulate temperature and pressure, manage oxygen levels, and ensure the sustainability of human life in such an alien environment [6].

Reduced Gravity: Mars has a gravitational force about 38% that of Earth's. While this reduced gravity allows for easier movement and less energy expenditure, it may have adverse long-term effects on human health [7]. Prolonged exposure to lower gravity levels can lead to muscle atrophy, bone density loss, and changes in cardiovascular and other bodily systems. Understanding and mitigating these health impacts is crucial for the long-term sustainability of human life on Mars [25].

Psychological Challenges: The isolation, confinement, and remote nature of a Mars settlement pose significant psychological challenges for settlers. These include dealing with the monotony of the environment, managing interpersonal dynamics in a small group, and coping with the knowledge of being millions of kilometers away from Earth [26]. Addressing these challenges requires careful selection of crew members, extensive training in psychological resilience, and the development of support systems and activities to maintain mental health and morale [27].

Environmental and Planetary Protection Concerns: Colonizing Mars raises important environmental and ethical considerations. These include the potential contamination of Mars with Earth microbes, which could jeopardize the search for indigenous Martian life and alter the Martian ecosystem [14]. Additionally, ethical questions about the human alteration of another planetary body must be considered, balancing the scientific and exploration goals with the need to preserve Mars's natural state [13].

These challenges highlight the complexity of establishing a human presence on Mars. Addressing them requires technological innovation, robust engineering solutions, and considerations of human health, psychology, environmental impact, and ethical implications. The successful colonization of Mars depends on a multidisciplinary approach that integrates science, technology, human factors, and ethical considerations into a cohesive and sustainable strategy.

1.3. Significance of sustainable and cost-effective methods

The realization of Martian colonization hinges on the technological and scientific capability to reach and survive on Mars and the sustainability and economic feasibility of such missions [11]. The traditional models of space exploration, heavily reliant on Earth for supplies and support, are impractical for the scale and duration of Mars colonization efforts. Therefore, developing sustainable and cost-effective methods for living and working on Mars is crucial:

Economic Feasibility: The cost of transporting even the most essential supplies from Earth to Mars is astronomically high, given the distances and energy requirements for interplanetary travel [22]. This necessitates a paradigm shift towards using Martian resources (in-situ resource utilization, or ISRU) to support human life, including water extraction, oxygen production, and building materials. This approach reduces the launch mass and cost and enhances the mission's autonomy and resilience [28], [29].

Reduced Dependence on Earth: Given the communication delay of up to 24 minutes one way and the potential for periods of no communication, reliance on Earth for decision-making, problem-solving, and resupply is infeasible [7]. Achieving high self-sufficiency in energy production, food cultivation, and manufacturing is essential. This includes developing renewable energy systems like solar and nuclear power, closed-loop life support systems, and 3D printing technologies for tool and component manufacturing [30], [31].

Environmental and Ethical Responsibility: Mars's exploration and potential settlement must be conducted to minimize the impact on the Martian environment. This involves preventing biological contamination, preserving Martian sites of scientific interest, and ensuring that activities on Mars do not irreversibly alter the planet's environment [13], [14]. Ethical considerations in utilizing Martian resources and altering the Martian landscape also come into play, requiring thoughtful stewardship and international cooperation [32].

Technological Innovation and Scalability: The development of sustainable technologies for Mars colonization has broader implications for Earth. Innovations in energy efficiency, waste recycling, and habitat construction on Mars can inform sustainable practices and technologies on Earth. Furthermore, these technologies must be scalable and adaptable to support a growing and evolving Martian settlement [15], [16].

Socio-Economic Dynamics and Public Engagement: The economic models of Mars colonization, including public-private partnerships and the role of international collaborations, significantly impact the mission's structure and governance. Public engagement and support are vital for these missions' long-term success and sustainability, necessitating transparent communication and outreach efforts [1], [9].

1.4. Historical and technological progression toward Mars colonization

Context and historical perspective: The journey to Mars colonization began with early astronomical observations and expanded through scientific and engineering advancements. Fueled by science fiction, initial fascination transformed as space exploration became tangible with missions like the Viking programs and the Curiosity rover. These expeditions provided invaluable insights into Martian geology, atmosphere, and potential habitability, marking a transition from Mars as a distant enigma to a feasible target for human exploration [33], [34].

Technological evolution: The evolution of space technology is central to the feasibility of colonization on Mars. Key advancements include developing efficient propulsion systems, robust habitat designs, sustainable life support systems, and advanced robotics. Notably, as spearheaded by companies like SpaceX, the advent of reusable rocket technology offers a potential reduction in the immense costs associated with interplanetary travel. Concurrently, the rise of 3D printing technology holds promise for constructing habitats directly from Martian materials, a critical component of in-situ resource utilization [8], [35], [36], [37].

1.5. Challenges and considerations in Martian colonization

Scientific discoveries and environmental challenges: The wealth of data from Mars exploration missions has reshaped our understanding of the Red Planet. Discoveries of past water flows and essential life-sustaining elements underscore Mars's potential past habitability. However, settling on Mars introduces unique environmental and health challenges, notably the increased exposure to cosmic and solar radiation due to the thin Martian atmosphere and lack of a global magnetic field. These challenges extend to the human body, with research ongoing into the effects of prolonged exposure to Mars's reduced gravity [7], [23], [24], [38], [39], [40].

Socio-political, ethical, and economic considerations: The ambition to colonize Mars extends beyond technological and scientific realms, raising significant socio-political, ethical, and economic questions. These include concerns around planetary protection, the ethical implications of extraterrestrial resource appropriation, and the potential environmental impacts on Mars. The economic aspect, driven by both governmental and private sector interests, has become increasingly prominent. Companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin are pivotal in advancing Mars missions' economic feasibility. Moreover, Mars colonization holds potential as a platform for future space exploration, serving as a springboard for missions beyond the Martian orbit [8], [9], [13], [14], [41], [42].

Inspiring the future: The vision of Mars colonization continues to inspire and educate, capturing public interest and motivating the next generation of explorers. Through educational initiatives and public engagement, Mars missions are fostering a deeper understanding of the importance and impact of space exploration. As efforts and collaborations continue to advance, the prospect of human life thriving on Mars transforms from a distant dream into an approaching reality [15], [16], [43], [44].

Mars, often dubbed the ‘Red Planet’, has been an object of human curiosity and scientific investigation for centuries. With advances in space technology over the latter half of the 20th century and into the 21st century, our understanding of Mars has transitioned from telescopic observations to detailed in-situ investigations by robotic emissaries [18], [45].

2.1. Early observations and speculations

Mars has been known since ancient times due to its visible reddish appearance in the night sky. The planet's distinctive color is due to iron oxide (rust) on its surface [46]. This observation, easily visible to the naked eye, has historically led to various interpretations and mythologies surrounding Mars across different cultures. The scientific study of Mars took a significant turn in the late 19th century with the advent of more advanced telescopic technologies. Astronomers such as Giovanni Schiaparelli embarked on detailed observations of the Martian surface. Schiaparelli's mapping of Mars in 1877 and his description of ‘canali,’ an Italian term misconstrued as ‘canals,’ sparked widespread interest and speculation [47]. These observations suggested the presence of long, straight lines on the Martian surface, fueling theories about their artificial construction. The idea of Martian canals was significantly boosted by American astronomer Percival Lowell. Lowell was deeply influenced by Schiaparelli's findings and conducted his observations, dedicating much of his career to studying Mars. Between 1894 and 1908, he published several books and delivered numerous lectures where he argued fervently for the existence of canals on Mars, which he believed were evidence of an intelligent Martian civilization [48]. Lowell's theories were based on extensive, albeit subjective, observations made using his observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. Lowell's work on Martian canals was both influential and controversial, igniting public interest and scientific debate. While his theories were later disproven, they were crucial in promoting interest in Martian studies. Lowell's insistence on the existence of Martian canals led to increased funding and interest in astronomical research, indirectly aiding the advancement of the field. The early 20th century saw a gradual shift in the scientific community's view of Mars. As observational techniques improved and our understanding of the solar system deepened, the idea of Martian canals and an inhabited Mars began to wane. The development of spectroscopy, for instance, allowed astronomers to analyze the Martian atmosphere and surface composition more accurately. These studies revealed a lack of substantial water and a thin atmosphere, conditions unsuitable for the kind of life forms that Lowell had proposed [47], [49]. Additionally, the advent of space probes in the mid-20th century further transformed our understanding of Mars. The Mariner missions of the 1960s provided the first close-up images of the Martian surface, which showed no signs of the canals that Lowell had famously hypothesized [50]. These missions also began to unravel the complexities of Martian geology and atmosphere, laying the groundwork for future exploration. Despite the discrediting of Lowell's theories, his influence persisted. The fascination he helped foster led to Mars being a central focus in early science fiction literature, often depicting the planet as a world teeming with life and civilizations. Authors such as H.G. Wells and Edgar Rice Burroughs were inspired by the idea of Martian canals, weaving tales that captured the public's imagination and kept Mars at the forefront of extraterrestrial exploration in popular culture [51], [52]. In retrospect, the early observations and speculations about Mars illustrate the evolving nature of scientific inquiry and the impact of cultural and technological contexts on our understanding of the cosmos. These initial steps in observing and interpreting Mars not only enriched our knowledge of astronomy but also spurred public interest and scientific momentum that continues to drive Martian exploration to this day.

2.2. Robotic exploration

Robotic emissaries have largely carried out the journey to understand and explore Mars. From early reconnaissance missions to advanced rovers and orbiters, robotic exploration has been pivotal in unraveling the mysteries of the Red Planet. This journey of discovery has transformed our understanding of Mars, laying the groundwork for future human exploration. In this section, we trace the progression of these missions, highlighting their contributions and the evolving technologies that made them possible.

2.2.1. Early probes and flybys

The space age initiated the era of robotic Mars exploration. The first attempts by the Soviet Union's Mars program in the early 1960s faced challenges, with several missions failing either during launch, en-route, or upon arrival [53]. These early attempts paved the way for more advanced and reliable exploration technologies.

The USA's Mariner program was the first to successfully send back data from Mars [54]. Mariner 4, in 1965, performed the first successful flyby, revealing a barren landscape, contrary to previous speculations of a wetter Mars. These images provided the first close-up photographs of another planet, altering our perception of Mars from a potentially Earth-like world to a more barren and alien environment.

2.2.2. Landers and the quest for life

The 1970s saw the ambitious Viking program by NASA, aiming to land on and study the Martian surface directly. Viking 1 and Viking 2 landers undertook experiments to detect microbial life. Although the results from the labeled release experiment initially indicated possible metabolic activity, subsequent analysis suggested that the reactions were more likely due to inorganic processes [55], [56]. The Viking missions marked a significant leap in our ability to conduct complex experiments remotely on another planet.

2.2.3. Rovers: mobile geology labs

In the late 1990s and into the 2000s, rovers became central to Mars exploration. Pathfinder's Sojourner was the first, followed by the twin rovers Spirit and Opportunity. These missions revolutionized our understanding of Martian geology and climate history [50]. Notably, Opportunity discovered evidence of ancient liquid water flows on the Martian surface [57]. The rovers' capability to traverse and analyze the Martian terrain brought a new dimension to the exploration, enabling detailed geological studies across varied locations.

The car-sized Curiosity rover, part of NASA's Mars Science Laboratory mission, landed in 2012. Equipped with a suite of sophisticated instruments, Curiosity identified an ancient lakebed and detected organic molecules, further intensifying the search for potential past life [19], [58]. This advanced rover has been able to conduct more comprehensive scientific research, providing invaluable data on Mars' habitability.

2.2.4. Orbiters: eyes in the Martian sky

Complementing the surface missions, a series of orbiters have provided crucial data about Mars' atmosphere, climate, and geology. Notable missions include NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) and ESA's Mars Express [59], [60]. MRO's HiRISE camera has captured high-resolution images, aiding in landing site selection and studying geological features, while its SHARAD instrument has probed subsurface layers. These orbiters have been instrumental in mapping Mars' surface, studying its climate and weather patterns, and providing critical communication relays for surface missions.

2.3. Recent endeavors and international collaboration

The 2020s saw a global convergence towards Mars exploration. NASA's Perseverance rover and its innovative Ingenuity helicopter, the UAE's Hope orbiter, and China's Tianwen-1 mission, which includes both an orbiter and a rover, all reached Mars in 2021 [61], [62]. These missions represent a new era of exploration, characterized by international cooperation and advanced technology. Collaborative efforts, both international and between governmental and private entities, are seen as the pathway forward.

2.4. Prelude to human exploration

With the wealth of data from robotic missions, plans for human exploration and eventual colonization have gained momentum. Both NASA and ESA have outlined potential manned missions to Mars in their future roadmaps, viewing the Moon as a testing ground. Private entities, particularly SpaceX, envision large-scale colonization efforts [63], [64].

While the allure of Mars colonization is compelling, carefully synthesizing our learnings from robotic missions, rigorous research into life support and habitat systems, and international collaboration are vital to turn this vision into a reality [65].

3. Martian environment and challenges

The Martian environment presents many unique challenges that must be addressed to facilitate human exploration and potential settlement. These multidimensional challenges range from extreme climatic conditions to technological and health-related issues. This section explores these various challenges, focusing primarily on one of the most significant concerns: radiation exposure.

One of the most pressing challenges for human exploration and potential colonization of Mars is the intense radiation from galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) and solar energetic particles (SEPs) [24]. Unlike Earth, Mars lacks a strong magnetosphere and a thick atmosphere, both of which significantly attenuate the incoming cosmic and solar radiation on our home planet.

3.1.1. Sources of radiation

Two primary sources of space radiation would affect Mars explorers:

Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs): These are high-energy protons and heavy ions originating from sources outside our solar system, including supernovae. Their energy levels are so high that they can penetrate even the most advanced shielding technologies currently available [66].

Solar Energetic Particles (SEPs): These are sporadic bursts of radiation primarily composed of protons, emitted from the Sun during solar flares and coronal mass ejections [67].

3.1.2. Effects on human health

Prolonged exposure to space radiation has several potential health effects [68]:

Increased risk of cancer.

Acute radiation sickness from intense radiation bursts, such as significant solar flares.

Degenerative tissue effects, including cataract formation, cardiovascular diseases, and potential central nervous system damage.

Possible infertility and hereditary effects.

3.1.3. Quantifying Martian radiation

Measurements by the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) on the Curiosity rover revealed that an astronaut would be exposed to a minimum of 0.66 sieverts during a round trip to Mars, with a stay on the surface [24]. This is more than three times the radiation limit recommended for astronauts during their entire career.

where D is the cumulative radiation dose in sieverts (Sv),

) is the radiation rate as a function of time, and T is the total time of exposure, we can integrate over the duration of the Mars mission to determine the total dose an astronaut would receive.

3.1.4. Mitigating radiation exposure

Several strategies are under consideration to mitigate the radiation risk:

Advanced Shielding: Using materials such as water, polyethylene, or novel materials like hydrogen-rich boron nitride nanotubes for spacecraft and habitats [69], [70].

Underground Habitats: Constructing habitats below the Martian surface can use Mars' regolith as a natural radiation barrier [71].

Magnetic Shields: Generating a protective magnetosphere around the habitat or spacecraft requires significant energy [23], [70].

Pharmaceutical Countermeasures: Drugs that can mitigate radiation damage or boost the body's natural repair mechanisms [72].

Conclusively, while radiation is a significant challenge for Mars exploration and colonization, ongoing research aims to develop viable solutions to ensure the safety and health of future Martian explorers and settlers [71].

Mars is infamous for its planet-wide dust storms, which can last for weeks to months, enveloping the entire surface in a thick haze [43]. While these storms are not accompanied by the high winds seen in terrestrial storms due to the thin Martian atmosphere [73], they pose unique challenges for human exploration and colonization. Understanding and mitigating the effects of these dust storms is crucial for the success of both robotic and human missions to Mars.

3.2.1. Characteristics of Martian dust storms

Frequency: Localized dust storms frequently occur on Mars, but approximately once every three Martian years (or roughly 5.5 Earth years), the conditions allow these local storms to expand and merge, covering the entire planet [43].

Composition: Martian dust particles are extremely fine, comparable to talcum powder, and are composed mainly of iron oxides, giving Mars its characteristic red color [74].

Electrostatic Nature: Due to the continuous bombardment by ultraviolet (UV) radiation, these dust particles can become electrostatically charged, causing them to cling to surfaces [75].

3.2.2. Challenges posed by dust storms

Solar Power Generation: One of the immediate challenges of dust storms is the significant reduction in sunlight, which can drop to less than 1% of normal levels during a global dust storm [76]. This poses a threat to missions that rely on solar power. For instance, the Opportunity rover's mission was terminated after it lost power during a massive dust storm in 2018 [77].

Thermal Management: Dust accumulation on equipment and habitats can disrupt thermal control by insulating equipment or blocking radiators, leading to overheating [78].

Equipment Wear and Tear: Martian dust's fine, abrasive nature can lead to wear and tear on equipment, especially moving parts like joints and wheels on rovers or seals on habitats [74].

Human Health: The dust's fine nature poses a potential respiratory hazard for astronauts. If it's tracked inside habitats, it could be inhaled and cause health issues [79]. Additionally, the iron oxides in the dust might pose chemical risks if ingested or inhaled in significant amounts [80].

Visibility and Navigation: Dust storms can hamper visibility, making navigation and scientific observations challenging [43].

3.2.3. Mitigation strategies

Alternative Power Sources: Exploratory missions and habitats can integrate backup power sources, such as nuclear power or advanced battery storage, to remain operational during prolonged dust storms [76], [80].

Protective Coatings: Equipment can be coated with materials that repel electrostatically charged dust, reducing accumulation [75].

Airlocks and Filtration: Advanced airlock systems and filtration units can reduce the amount of dust brought into Martian habitats, protecting both equipment and astronauts [79].

Dust Monitoring and Forecasting: Integrating meteorological equipment to monitor and forecast dust movements can allow missions to take preventive measures before storms hit their location [78].

While Martian dust storms do not pose an immediate life-threatening danger, as Hollywood might suggest, they do present substantial operational challenges [76], [77]. Future Martian missions must be equipped to handle these challenges to ensure the safety and success of human exploration and colonization efforts. Comprehensive understanding and proactive planning are essential to mitigate the risks posed by these dust storms, ensuring the reliability and longevity of equipment and safeguarding the health of astronauts on the Martian surface. The unique nature of these storms also offers valuable opportunities for scientific study, contributing to our knowledge of Martian meteorology and climate patterns.

3.3. Temperature variations

Mars exhibits extreme temperature fluctuations, much more pronounced than those experienced on Earth [81], [82]. This vast temperature range and the thin atmosphere directly impact human habitation and technological equipment functioning on the Martian surface. Understanding and effectively managing these temperature variations is critical for designing habitats, spacesuits, and all equipment intended for Mars.

3.3.1. Characteristics of Martian temperature

Daily Fluctuations: Mars experiences significant diurnal temperature fluctuations, with temperatures at the equator ranging from a maximum of about 20 °C (70 °F) at noon to a minimum of -73 °C (-100 °F) at night [83].
