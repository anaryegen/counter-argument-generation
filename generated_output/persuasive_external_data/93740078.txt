Labeling AI-generated content. Yes or No?

Hi there! Lately, I've noticed a surge in ads that seem to be created with AI. Especially, on Instagram. For example, there was an image in the stories ad that looked so AI, with unnatural cutouts on the Halloween pumpkins and other details that pointed to artificiality. It got me thinking, whether brands should start informing their audience about their use of AI? In content creation, particularly for marketing and advertising, what do you think are (or could be) the best practices for companies regarding labeling AI-generated content? Do you think this could impact consumer trust?

Matters not .. all those food commercials are fake food. Models wear tons of make up. Lies everywhere.

In food commercials, they often use phrases like "serving suggestion", or, say, in mascara commercials, I've seen the statements like "lashes enhanced with inserts for dramatic effect". I know it's not something that's done consistently, and these statements are printed somewhere at the bottom and they're so tiny you can barely read them. Either way, at least some brands are trying to be transparent (or not to get fined by regulators).

I disagree. When companies are honest with their customers it builds trust. Sure models wear makeup, but we expect them to. Use of AI is new and I won't even watch a video with digital "spokesperson ", so all their dollars are in vain. I'd rather watch someone with a million flaws but real. We live in a world superficiality where we're sold perfection and flawlessness...but its not what sells. Originality does

I agree with you. Let‚Äôs not use technology to provide the best results.

You do know that with your logic we shouldn‚Äôt use art programs on computers because it violates traditional ways to do art.
