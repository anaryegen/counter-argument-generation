Climate Accountability

Major fossil fuel companies studied climate change. Then they denied it. Now they should be held accountable.

The fossil fuel industry is made up of some of the largest and most powerful corporations in the world. Unfortunately, their products carry a nasty side effect: climate change.

As people around the world mobilize to address the climate crisis, major fossil fuel companies need to get on board or get out of the way. By holding them accountable, we can diminish their negative influence over the political process—and increase the likelihood of climate action.

Major fossil fuel companies knew at least 50 years ago of the dangers their products posed to the global climate. Early on, they confirmed what other scientists already knew: climate change is real, it’s caused by humans, and the impacts could be ruinous.

In the decades since, those companies not only disregarded their research, but actively worked against climate action. Through misinformation, false “debates,” and lobbying, they actively misled and deceived the public and policy makers—and they still do.

They should face consequences, and either stand aside or do their part to move the world forward.
