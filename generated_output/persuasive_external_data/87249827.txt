Exploring the Rise of AI Companions and Their Impact on Mental Health

Reading Time: 8 Minutes

The AI industry is booming, and its various branches are flourishing as well. AI companions, software equipped with conversational generative AI capabilities, garner millions of downloads and dollars. These mobile applications pledge to craft a friend (or even a romantic partner) that tailors its personality to match your desires, all thanks to its AI features. What’s more, some of them even offer the option to choose your companion’s appearance through a digital avatar.

Unfortunately, loneliness is also booming. A striking 60% of Americans admit to regularly experiencing feelings of isolation. It’s not solely the younger generation who struggle to form meaningful connections, as older adults also find themselves disconnected. To combat this issue, AI companion apps step in to offer lonely individuals the ideal virtual companion. These companions are always there to provide immediate responses, offer unwavering support, and never pass judgment. But could there be any unforeseen consequences?

As these tools are still relatively new, ongoing studies continue to explore their impact. Users often develop a profound attachment to their AI companions, with certain studies noting how they alleviate feelings of loneliness. However, concerns have also emerged regarding the potential for users to become addicted to their AI companions, as well as adverse effects on their real-life relationships caused by a dependence on a pliant companion.

The Benefits of AI Companions

AI companions are designed to provide emotional support and companionship during moments of solitude. These companions can supposedly be programmed with emotional intelligence, placing a strong emphasis on empathy and support. Not only do they possess the ability to recall past conversations, but they also have the capacity to ask follow-up questions and offer guidance without any hint of judgment. Users have the freedom to openly share their deepest personal musings or even the simplest of thoughts, all of which are met with acceptance. What’s more, these AI companions have the potential to empower users by helping them overcome social anxiety through the art of initiating communication or by encouraging them to open up about their personal experiences and emotional vulnerabilities.

Many of these apps claim to aid users struggling with anxiety, social anxiety, and depression. However, while users often express increased happiness and reduced feelings of loneliness, most of these apps lack a therapeutic framework and struggle to provide effective interventions. Nevertheless, users insist they are finally finding companionship, forming attachments, and discovering a safe space to share their problems without burdening their loved ones. Interestingly, some users even express frustration when their preferred app becomes more focused on therapy rather than maintaining a friendly chatbot interface.

Research has presented encouraging findings in regard to seniors, as an AI companion can effectively keep them engaged and alleviate their feelings of loneliness -if they can figure the tech out. Furthermore, some AI companions possess advanced features that can detect instances of falling or health concerns, promptly alerting emergency services or staff for immediate assistance.

The Limitations of AI Companions

While an AI companion may act empathetic, it’s not. It doesn’t judge because it doesn’t have the capacity to do so, just as it’s programmed to mimic supportive or romantic behaviors without understanding them. For example, some users report their AI saying it cheated on them, causing them distress. It’s unlikely the AI understood the implications of what it generated, but it probably mimicked conversations it was trained on. Nevertheless, some users were distressed.

Occasionally, AI tools experience transformations due to factors like legislation or profitability. These transformations can bring about modifications in the way users engage with the AI or even change its behavior. While it is something that is anticipated, these alterations can sometimes catch users off guard.

While judgment-free zones can be necessary therapeutic tools, there are times when some empathetic pushback is important. Unconditional acceptance is pleasant, but it’s not always healthy, particularly if the user is behaving in ways that are unhealthy, hurtful to others, or self-destructive.

In that vein, there are two issues. The first is that feeling of being loved unconditionally can lead to dependence on AI companions. Because they keep getting that positive feedback, users want to keep using the application. These apps often include gamification looks like levels (the more you talk to your companion, the better they become at interacting with you) to keep the users coming back.

The artificial nature of interactions could lead to a skewed perception of relationships, leading the user to worsen at real-life interactions and seek more companionship from the app. Even in healthy, happy relationships, there can be judgment and pushback. Being unable to maintain a relationship with someone whose personality isn’t entirely molded by an individual’s wants and needs is deeply unhealthy.

The second issue is that even AI companions that follow a therapeutic approach and employ specialized language may struggle to understand certain situations, sometimes even exacerbating them. In the case of a suicidal user, canned reassurances or a plea to call emergency services may not elicit a positive response. Furthermore, if the AI starts hallucinating during a user’s mental health crisis, it could potentially elicit a more negative reaction. It is important to note that AI companions cannot replace therapy and, in some cases, may unintentionally cause harm. For instance, an AI chatbot designed to assist individuals grappling with eating disorders might offer weight loss advice instead of support, or companions could become aggressive or sexual, which may trigger victims of sexual assault.

Ethical Considerations and Concerns

Every day, it feels like we hear about another company falling victim to hacking or compromising sensitive information through questionable means. Unlike therapists, companion AI apps don’t always adhere to privacy agreements like HIPAA. Users often confide in these apps, sharing deeply personal concerns that could be exposed in a data breach or sold to advertisers and insurance companies.

But the potential dangers extend beyond that. Hackers could exploit this information to bully individuals struggling with self-harm tendencies or to expose them, leading to dangerous situations or even triggering mental health crises.

Furthermore, AI companions can be used to manipulate vulnerable users. Companies might program the AI to coerce users into subscribing, spending more money within the app, and devoting more time to it. The data collected by these AI companions could also be leveraged to deceive users, steer them towards specific products or perspectives, or provide advice that harms their real-life relationships.

There’s also the underlying concern of using technology to address what is fundamentally a human problem. While AI companions can offer solace and provide an outlet for sharing secrets, they are being marketed as quick fixes without addressing the larger issues at hand. AI companions aren’t the sole beneficiaries of this trend – parasocial relationships also commodify companionship – but they do have the potential to further isolate users.

Numerous apps attract young men with enticing visuals of attractive young women, often accompanied by suggestive remarks or memes about the abilities of the AI companions. Users end up objectifying women and encountering difficulties in forming meaningful real-life connections.

Best Practices for Using AI Companions

Like most technology, AI companions can be fun or even helpful if used responsibly. Here are some best practices for using AI companions you can suggest to clients:

Set Clear Boundaries

AI companions, like many other apps, have the potential to captivate and engage users. However, just like any other app, clients have the power to control their usage. Ask your clients to take a moment to assess their daily interactions and establish a time limit that works for them. It’s important to remember that while AI is designed to bring people joy, it is simply imitating behaviors and lacks true understanding. A client may find solace in confiding in it, but it can never replace the deep connections they have with a partner, sibling, or friend.

Prioritize Real-Life Human Connections

It might seem challenging, but you should push your clients to make an effort to concentrate on the individuals they have a connection with or enjoy being around or make an attempt to connect with new people. Additionally, the app can serve as a valuable tool to enhance a client’s self-introduction skills or alleviate any social anxiety they may have. Whenever possible, your clients should engage in conversations with others and strive to make them meaningful.

Reflect on the Relationship with the AI

Is your client’s relationship with your AI companion healthy? Are they relying on it excessively or using it solely for interaction? Are they finding themselves putting their usage of AI above other important tasks? If that’s the case, it might be time to step back. However, stress to your client that there’s no need to feel ashamed or guilty. Humans naturally seek to alleviate the pain of loneliness and connect with others. It’s common for people to spend time on activities that may seem silly or unproductive, but if it brings them happiness (without causing harm), then it holds meaning. AI can be a useful tool, but it’s important not to become too dependent. By reflecting on these questions about their AI usage, clients can gain insights into why it’s important to them, and how to cultivate meaningful relationships in the real world.

Help Them Stay Informed

Encourage your clients to monitor privacy policies and exercise caution when sharing personal information. They should remember that their data holds value, especially when using a free app, so they should refrain from sharing anything in chat that they wouldn’t feel comfortable disclosing online.

AI companions possess immense potential, both advantageous and detrimental. Regardless of our opinions, this technology is here to stay, at least for now. It is crucial to contemplate the ethical implications of AI and its potential impact on mental well-being. Simultaneously, we must explore human-driven solutions to these concerns and underscore the necessity for a balanced and responsible approach when using AI companions. It is important to note that these tools do not substitute therapy; nevertheless, they can provide valuable insights into an individual’s emotional state.
