Genetic Modification: Disease Prevention or Future Disaster?

Margaret Sanders - Student·

UNICEF estimates that 255 babies are born every minute. Just about 3% of all babies are born with genetic disorders. Applying this statistic to the population of the United States of America, over 9.5 million people are living with genetic disorders that they were born with.

As technology advances, humans have become more innovative in our ways of problem solving. For example, scientists are diving deeper into the world of genetic modification, and how the developments of this science will impact future generations to come, for better and for worse. Researchers are studying how genetic modifying can alter genes in human embryos to potentially eliminate risks of diseases passed by heredity. The hope is that when perfected, this new technology will prevent genetic disorders from being passed down from one generation to the next by genetically modifying the DNA of an embryo. However, many believe this practice is inhumane and unethical, as it will one day evolve into the manipulation of human traits based on preference, going against the nature of heredity.

Once this practice becomes commonly used after further research and testing, scientists should utilize their ability to alter genetics for solely the purpose of treating medical malfunctions, and not for the use of picking and choosing traits of embryos based on modifying genes. Genetic modification of human embryos should be utilized in disease prevention for future generations, however manipulation of genes should not cross into the territory of pre-selecting human traits.

Utilizing genetic modification on human embryos for anything more than to terminate harmful conditions passed down through genes is unethical and potentially harmful. When this scientific method crosses into the territory of pre-selecting human traits, it goes against everything we have ever known as generations and generations of human beings. Germ-line, or embryo engineering is the practice of altering of the genetic sequencing of a human embryo pre-birth. To many, it is seen as a “path toward a dystopia of superpeople and designer babies for those who can afford it” (Regaldo). As science evolves, it may be possible in the future for people may be able to pick and choose the traits that their embryo will embody. Already in China, scientists are working with genetic modification on Beta thalassaemia, a blood disorder that in some cases, is fatal. These scientists used CRISPR/Cas9, a tool commonly known in the world of genetic modification used to edit genes involved in this disorder. Only a small percentage of the genes edited survived, showing obstacles that accompany this scientific exploration (Cyranoski and Reardon). Experts alongside him such as biologist George Daley at Harvard believe that this study is a scientific milestone, however much work still has to be done for this practice to be considered safe for embryos.

Genetic modification of human embryos is illegal in twenty-two countries around the world, such as South-Africa, Austria, and Japan. Although practiced in China, many other nations see it as dangerous and not to be practiced for ethical and social reasons. Experts have evaluated the social impacts of this practice on society as well as the ethical implications, and see it as the pathway to the widening of social classes. Altering society by allowing implementing genetic modification, once it is actually attainable will create a larger gap between rich and poor, gifted and inept. Experts see that it will be the affluent who can afford this ‘upgrade’ to their offspring, and the middle and lower classes will not be able to afford this. With access to this technology, the wealthy will begin to create generations of seemingly perfect offspring, while the children of the less affluent will struggle to compete, widening the socioeconomic gap and creating even larger societal issues. Clearly, the widening of social classes is detrimental to the functioning of society because it pushes back progress of attaining equality. Although not yet possible, this practice when used for unethical modifications should be feared. The research that genetic modification provides on reconstruction of DNA and disease prevention is potentially beneficial with much more practice, but it is still seen as dangerous and that is why it is prohibited for the altered embryo to be nurtured into human life.

Although genetic modification is seen as prevention for diseases, experts acknowledge the risks that coexist. As technology revolutionizes, we must be careful as to what can be achieved for the benefit of society, versus crossing the line into the dangerous. Ethical implications must be considered. It could be harmful to the gap of social classes, but even simpler than that: picking and choosing traits of a child such as hair and eye color would be wrongfully playing the role of ‘God’ and essentially picking and choosing traits that don’t need to be hand-picked. Genetic diversity of human traits is a part of meiosis and human reproduction that when not impacting quality of life, should not be altered. Countries banned this practice for legitimate reasons and as it becomes a more conceivable idea, all of its implications must be carefully thought out before it is practiced.

Genetic modification, when perfected and if used solely for research purposes in disease control and prevention can be very useful in the scientific world.

Altering DNA can be beneficial in terms of eliminating diseases that are passed down by heretics. There are almost 6000 diseases in humans that are caused by single gene mutations, and experts believe that genetic modification can be used to eliminate these diseases from being passed down to offspring. The main belief supporting genetic modification is the idea of quality of life, and how people can have the highest quality of life possible. If science could be used to alter genes that would ultimately eliminate diseases and allow a person to have a better quality of life, chances are that the choice would be made to alter those genes. Another point can be made to the economic aspect, and how the possibility of eliminating these diseases by genetic modification would lead to less spending on healthcare and medical bills, from those who need care for these diseases. It is clear that research still must be done on this practice, but if it were to become regularly practiced, the benefits of it being used to eliminate genetic disorders are evident. The future possibility of disease prevention such as this would be beneficial to society for several different reasons, as long as it does not cross ethical lines.

So let’s say the science behind this idea is perfected, let’s say that the 3% of babies could be reduced down into maybe just 1%, or maybe even 0%. The 255+ babies that were born in the seconds that this article was being read, could be reduced down to a much smaller number with practice of genetic modification. Sounds like a perfect solution, doesn’t it? Sure thing, as long as it doesn’t cross the line into unethical.
