Rhode Island's Charter Public Schools

Rhode Island's charter schools are public schools authorized by the State of Rhode Island to operate independently from many state and local district rules and regulations. Each charter public school is able to establish educational strategies that meet the specific student achievement goals and objectives outlined in each school's charter.

Rhode Island General Law 16-77-5.1(b) designates the Council on Elementary and Secondary Education (the Council) as the authorizer for charter schools. In this capacity, the Council is responsible for charter school approval, renewal and revocation. RIDE is delegated with the authority and responsibility to manage a comprehensive system of charter school accountability, review, monitoring, and system management. With the support of RIDE’s charter team, the Council plays a fundamental role in maintaining and advancing the quality and accountability of the charter sector.

Rhode Island is one of only seven states in which the SEA, in conjunction with the State's Board of Education, is the sole authorizer. As the sole authorizer, the Council bears substantial responsibility for balancing the statutory goal of increased autonomy of charter schools against the accountability required by the state and federal authorities.

About Charter Public Schools

Types of Rhode Island Charter Public Schools

District Charter Schools: Schools created by existing public schools, groups of public school personnel, public school districts, or a group of school districts.

Independent Charter Schools: Schools created by: (i) Rhode Island nonprofit organizations provided that these nonprofit organizations shall have existed for at least two (2) years and must exist for a substantial reason other than to operate a school or (ii) Colleges or universities within the State of Rhode Island.

Mayoral Academies: Schools created by a mayor of any city or town within the State of Rhode Island, acting by or through a nonprofit organization (regardless of the time said nonprofit organization is in existence) to establish a mayoral academy.

Attributes of Charter Public Schools

The charter public school differs from the traditional public school in the following ways:

Autonomy: Charter public schools are created and governed by independent boards and operated separately from the policies of traditional school districts. In exchange for this autonomy, the state has certain expectations.

Accountability: Charter public schools are held accountable for meeting student achievement goals and face charter revocation if they under-perform.

Choice: Charter public schools provide choice for parents and students seeking alternatives to traditional public education.

Innovation: Charter public schools are expected to be vanguards in improving and expanding opportunities within public education.

Proposals for New or Expanding Charter Public Schools

Requests for Proposals for New Student Seats in Charter Public Schools

Request for Proposals for New Student Seats

The authorization process for new and expanding charters is in one centralized document, to help provide consistency and clarity for charter applicants.

RIDE will prioritize proposals that focus on increasing the number of high-quality education options for students who would have otherwise attended a school identified as in need of Comprehensive Support and School Improvement and for educationally disadvantaged students: economically-disadvantaged students, differently-abled students, and/or multilingual learners.

The 2024 Request for Proposals for New Student Seats launched on April 22, 2024.

The 2024 Request for Proposals for New Student Seats can be found here. [DOC, 252 KB]

The budget template for Charter Schools is posted here. [XLS, 64 KB]

The budget template for Mayoral Academies is posted here. [XLS, 64 KB]

The budget template can also be sent upon request to RICharters@ride.ri.gov

The Charter School Readiness Handbook is available upon request.

All applications will be reviewed using a Completeness Check tool. [DOC, 36 KB]

Additional Measures as related to Charter Management Organizations

Parameters regarding charter management organizations are already in this application, but additionally, Charter Management Organizations applicants will be asked to file a plan with the Office of School Opportunities on how they will avoid conflicts of interest and related party transactions or insufficient segregation of duties between the Charter School and CMO. This request will be made by the Office of School Opportunities to the applicant after the applicant has received an approved completeness check. This answer will be reviewed by RIDE’s legal office before anything proceeds forward with the application.

Under current practice, all application teams need to complete an RFP, with a full public comment period and public hearings and approval by the Council on Elementary and Special Education, in order to open a charter.

Charter Public School Accountability

Charter Public School Accountability

In addition to being classified just as any other Rhode Island public school, charter public schools are reviewed and held accountable for meeting student academic and organizational performance goals and face charter revocation or non renewal if they under-perform. If successful, each charter may be granted a term for up to 5 years.

Please review the Charter Performance Review System Handbook for more detail on the charter performance indicators and information about the renewal process.

Charter public schools in Rhode Island are held to common measures of academic, financial and organizational performance. Specifically:

Student Academic Performance

Financial Performance

Organizational Performance

Legal, Regulatory and Charter Contract Compliance

The handbook has been updated to reflect the revised Statewide Accountability System in alignment with the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA).

Each year beginning with the 2016-17 school year, RIDE compiles an annual Charter School Performance Dashboard, for each charter public school, based on the indicators above. The report template can be found here.

Charter School Financial Reporting

Charter School Financial Reporting

Rhode Island General Law § 16-77-3.1 (f) states: “All charter public schools shall adhere to financial record keeping, reporting, auditing requirements, and procedures as required by the Rhode Island department of education and in accordance with federal and state laws and regulations.”

This quick guide provides an overview of reporting deadlines for financial reports.
