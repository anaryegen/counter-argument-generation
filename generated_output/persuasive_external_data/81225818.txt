Reporting EBT card skimming and requesting replacement benefits

The OIG Fraud Hotline does not process card cancellations or replacement benefits.

If you believe your SNAP benefits have been stolen or that your EBT card (Lone Star card) has been compromised, immediately contact the Lone Star card helpdesk at (800) 777-7328 to cancel the card. A new card should arrive in the mail within seven days, allowing clients to access their balance.

To request replacement benefits, SNAP recipients must visit a local HHS office and fill out Form H1854, Affidavit for Unauthorized Use of EBT Benefits. If individuals are unable to visit a local office due to factors such as age, disability, distance, or inability to appoint an authorized representative, they can call their local HHSC office to have the form mailed to them. Once the claim is reviewed, HHSC will inform the individuals by mail within two weeks if they are eligible for replacement benefits.

Benefits replaced cannot exceed the amount stolen or an amount equal to two months of the household’s SNAP benefits, whichever is less. Please visit the HHS SNAP fraud benefit replacement page for more information on the process, including important deadlines.

If you are aware of a fraudulent website targeting HHS recipients or related to HHS programs, please report the concern as a cybercrime to the following agencies:
