Cultured meat has the potential to become a sustainable source of nutritional protein in the future.

Hazards and risks may be introduced during the production of cultured meat.

Effective risk assessment strategies should be adopted to ensure safety of cultured meat.

Regulatory framework for cultured meat should be harmonized eventually.

Notwithstanding some controversies, the development of cell culture and tissue engineering and the increasing demand for sustainable animal-based protein, has rendered cultured meat to be a potential source of nutritional protein in the future. As an absolutely novel food, the production of cultured meat involves complex advanced technologies and integration of multiple novel ingredients. Consequently, hazards and risks may be introduced inadvertently at any stage during the production of cultured meat, which must be reviewed and approved by the regulations or legislations of the corresponding jurisdictions before the product can be introduced to the market to ensure food safety and promote human health. Currently, increasing research on the safety and risk assessment of cultured meat is being reported. However, the lack of systematic and in-depth risk assessment of cultured meat remains a hurdle to be crossed before global marketization of cultured meat can materialize.

This review comprehensively summarizes the possible hazards and risks that could be introduced during the production of cultured meat and proposes countermeasures accordingly.

There is no one-size-fits-all approach to test different types of cultured meat products currently and effective risk and safety assessment strategies should be adopted contextually. Additionally, the regulatory framework for cultured meat in different regions may evolve differently but should be harmonized eventually to fuel the development of safe and nutritious cultured meat products globally.

Livestock farming is an important industry that contributes to national economy and people's livelihood. The positive impacts and benefits include the supply of protein-rich food, employment opportunities for workers, and maintenance of biodiversity and cultural heritage (Dumont et al., 2019; Dumont, Groot, & Tichit, 2018). However, global livestock farming has recently been constrained by its negative impact on the environment (greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption and pollution, species extinction, etc.), ethics (animal welfare) and human health (antibiotic overuse, foodborne illness, zoonotic diseases, occupational diseases, etc.) (Rubio, Xiang, & Kaplan, 2020). The demand for animal-based proteins is predicted to double with the world population forecast to increase to 9.7 billion by 2050 (Hadidi et al., 2022). With the development of cell culture and tissue engineering techniques, some researchers postulate that it is becoming increasingly possible to obtain sustainable animal proteins using fewer animal-derived materials than traditional animal husbandry, while avoiding selected drawbacks of consuming conventional animal protein (Kumar, Sood, & Han, 2023). The first cultured beef burger in the world came out in the laboratory of Professor Mark Post at Maastricht University on August 5, 2013, which set off a trend in cultured meat research (Mattick, Landis, & Allenby, 2015). The 2022 State of the Industry Reports from the Good Food Institute stated that 156 cultured meat companies across 29 countries have been founded so far and 19 of them were launched in 2022 (Claire et al., 2022). Notably, Singapore is the only country that permits the regulated sale of cultured meat products currently.

Additionally, various terms such as cultured meat, clean meat, in vitro meat, lab-grown meat, cell-based meat, cultivated meat and animal-free meat are used to describe this product (Hallman, Hallman, & Hallman, 2023). Its name is actually a matter of debate and controversy and may have great significance in the European or Arabic countries due to legislation and religious beliefs (Chriki, Ellies-Oury, & Hocquette, 2022; FAO, 2022). The priorities of these terms are not discussed in this review and for consistency, the term “cultured meat” is used. Cultured meat refers to the edible muscle tissue that is produced by cultivating cells but is not directly obtained from farming animals (Kumar et al., 2023). As one of the most important fields of cellular agriculture, the production of cultured meat relies on cell biology and tissue engineering technology, mainly including targeted cells or tissues collection from living animals or freshly slaughtered animals, cell isolation and culture, biomass production (cell proliferation/expansion, differentiation and maturation) and product collection (Chen et al., 2022). Although the life cycle analysis reflects that the energy consumption of cultured meat may be greater than that of poultry meat, the production of cultured meat requires less water, land and energy and emits fewer greenhouse gases compared to agricultural beef, sheep and pork meat. Despite high uncertainty, the authors concluded that the overall environmental impacts of cultured meat production are substantially lower than those of conventionally produced meat (Tuomisto & Teixeira, 2011). Nevertheless, with greater clarity in cultured meat technology in recent years, there may be some inaccuracies in the above conclusion (Mattick et al., 2015). More recent research claims an opposing viewpoint, for example, cultured meat was reported to require higher energy than pork (Ye, Zhou, Guan, & Sun, 2022) and emit comparable greenhouse gases to beef (Klein, 2023; Lynch & Pierrehumbert, 2019). The technology of cultured meat production is still in its infancy, and its impact on the environment is closely associated with the specific production system and scale (Treich, 2021). Until now, the opinions on the environmental impact of cultured meat production remains relatively divided and non-unanimous. Consequently, the overall impact of cultured meat on the environmental need to be further assessed, monitored and clarified (FAO, 2022).

Being cultured within a bioreactor under controlled artificial conditions, cultured meat is less reliant on environmental factors such as weather and geography and addresses some an ethical issue associated with traditional animal husbandry such as livestock slaughter (Stephens et al., 2018). Additionally, stem cells from farm animals are predicted to produce a million times more meat than corresponding farm animal carcasses and cultured meat can be fully consumed instead of wasting some inedible parts of traditional meat (Connor, 2013). Some authors claim that cultured meat has great potential to be a sustainable source of protein (Jairath, Mal, Gopinath, & Singh, 2021). Strict control in the production of cultured meat avoids the reproduction of pathogenic bacteria and thus reduces biological risks and the possibility of disease occurrence (Post, 2012). These benefits promote the popularity and development of cultured meat. However, some challenges persist. Although cultured meat can be easily produced on a small scale, it becomes expensive for large quantity production. Therefore, one challenge is the optimization of scale-up production such as innovating an alternative to replace the rare fetal bovine serum and recapitulating the in vivo myogenic environment (Ye et al., 2022). Consumer acceptance constitutes an additional hurdle where it is relatively low in most countries. For example, some consumers are concerned about the safety of cultured meat due to the opaqueness of its production techniques and even have nauseous reactions when hearing this concept and firmly refuse to take any risks in consuming cultured meat (Liu, Hocquette, Ellies-Oury, Chriki, & Hocquette, 2021). Various terminologies associated with cultured meat may also affect consumers’ acceptance. Hence, an appropriate term is crucial to promote the development of this industry and an international harmonized name is imminent (Hallman et al., 2023).

It is most important to assess the safety of novel food before its introduction to guarantee consumer health. Some regulations or legislations have been enacted to assess the nutrition and risk of cultured meat. Although the general production process of cultured meat has been extensively reported, key information such as relevant commercial production technology and final product composition is still unclear, posing challenges for regulatory authorities. At the same time, the rapid progress of cultured meat research engenders constant update of regulations. However, safety assessment of cultured meat is less structured currently due to the novel and complex production process, unexpected biological mechanisms and unforeseen consequences associated with each product (Petetin, 2014). The lack of systematic and in-depth risk assessment of cultured meat is hence the biggest obstacle to the marketization of cultured meat. This review comprehensively summarizes the possible risks that could be introduced during the production of cultured meat and proposes countermeasures. The overarching goal is to consolidate this information and develop systematic safety assessment of cultured meat products in the near future.

Key technologies and possible risks that could be introduced during cultured meat production

Although some companies have successfully produced cultured meat products, the detailed production process remains as trade secrets unknown to the public. Lack of transparency is a major problem in the food production process to ensure food safety and health. Nonetheless, the critical steps to construct complex structures of livestock muscles using a small number of cells have been extensively discussed. Generally, there are four key technical aspects, including cell collection, cell culture,

The premise of safety-standardized production of cultured meat

Hazards and risks may be introduced inadvertently at any time during the production of cultured meat. Therefore, standardized procedures and practices such as good laboratory practices (EFSA, 2021), good manufacturing practices (FDA, 2015), good cell culture practices (Bal-Price & Coecke, 2011) and code of hygienic practices (CAC, 2005; Hadi & Brightwell, 2021) are prerequisites for the safe production of cultured meat. Another key strategy is the application of hazard and risk management

Regulations or legislations of cultured meat

Cultured meat is an unquestionable novel food. Consequently, each cultured meat product must be evaluated by the regulations or legislations of the corresponding jurisdictions before it can be introduced to the market to ensure food safety and human health. Currently, there is no firm definition of food safety, but European food law (known as the General Food Law) (Regulation (EU) No 178/2002) states that unsafe food is either harmful to health or unfit for human consumption, which depends on

Conclusion and future perspectives

With the development of cell culture and tissue engineering and the increasing demand for sustainable animal-based proteins, cultured meat has the potential to become a sustainable source of nutritional protein in the future due to its relative ethical and healthy properties. However, further inter-disciplinary research needs to be conducted before cultured meat become part of our food staples. Currently, some technical challenges in producing cultured meat products in large quantities

Designing cultivated meat: Overcoming challenges in the production process and developing sustainable packaging solutions

2024, Trends in Food Science and Technology

The commercialization of cultivated meat offers a promising avenue for sustainable food production. However, there is an urge to develop products with high marketability that could ensure food safety and quality, as well as desirable shelf-life and environmental friendliness. The current limitations in packaging/labeling approaches and the production process of cultivated meat have resulted in quality disparities, necessitating overviewing and analyzing the research in this area to match the physical attributes, nutritional content, and sensory properties of cultivated meat with conventional meat.

This study aims to analyze the current limitations of cultivated meat and provide recommendations that serve as guidelines for enhancing its quality. Additionally, the considerations for developing environmentally friendly and sustainable packaging that ensures the safety and quality of cultivated meat have been outlined along with future research directions.

Numerous parameters, including stem cells, appropriate scaffold materials, increased muscle tissue cells with actomyosin, and genetic modification, must be considered during the production process to enhance cultivated meat quality. Also, modifying packaging materials with emerging technologies and using by-products or bio-based materials could create sustainable packaging for cultivated meat. Lastly, transparency in labeling is vital in reducing the risk of food neophobia associated with cultivated meat.

High-throughput analysis of hazards in novel food based on the density functional theory and multimodal deep learning

2024, Food Chemistry

The emergence of cultured meat presents the potential for personalized food additive manufacturing, offering a solution to address future food resource scarcity. Processing raw materials and products in synthetic food products poses challenges in identifying hazards, impacting the entire industrial chain during the industry's further evolution. It is crucial to examine the correlation of biological information at different levels and to reveal the temporal dynamics jointly. Proposed active prevention method includes four aspects: (i) Investigating the molecular-level mechanism underlying the binding and dissociation of hazards with proteins represents a novel approach to mitigate matrix effect. (ii) Identifying distinct fragments is a pivotal advancement toward developing a novel screening strategy for hazards throughout the food chain. (iii) Designing an artificial intelligence model-based approach to acquire multi-dimensional histology data also holds significant potential for various applications. (iv) Integrating multimodal data is a practical approach to enhance evaluation and feedback control accuracy.

Review: Livestock cell types with myogenic differentiation potential: Considerations for the development of cultured meat

With the current environmental impact of large-scale animal production and societal concerns about the welfare of farm animals, researchers are questioning whether we can cultivate animal cells for the purpose of food production. This review focuses on a pivotal aspect of the cellular agriculture domain: cells. We summarised information on the various cell types from farm animals currently used for the development of cultured meat, including mesenchymal stromal cells, myoblasts, and pluripotent stem cells. The review delves into the advantages and limitations of each cell type and considers factors like the selection of the appropriate cell source, as well as cell culture conditions that influence cell performance. As current research in cultured meat seeks to create muscle fibers to mimic the texture and nutritional profile of meat, we focused on the myogenic differentiation capacity of the cells. The most commonly used cell type for this purpose are myoblasts or satellite cells, but given their limited proliferation capacity, efforts are underway to formulate myogenic differentiation protocols for mesenchymal stromal cells and pluripotent stem cells. The multipotent character of the latter cell types might enable the creation of other tissues found in meat, such as adipose and connective tissues. This review can help guiding the selection of a cell type or culture conditions in the context of cultured meat development.
