Should AI-Generated Content Be Labeled?

Hello everyone! I am just wondering, If AI is used in content creation, do you think it is necessary to disclose its use? On one hand, it seems like a matter of honesty and transparency. On the other, even smartphone cameras are equipped with neural networks, and according to this logic, almost any photo taken by me should contain such a label. And if I write a blog post and use AI-powered spell checkers or ask questions in ChatGPT, should I include disclaimers? I am puzzled. How do you define the line after which it would be ethical to inform the reader/user/client? Share

I don’t think so, no. I think AI is a tool, when used correctly, and as I feel no need to divulge whether I used Word or Google Docs, or used grammarly, I feel no need to disclose whether AI is part of my workflow. Hell, while writing this on my phone, I used the predictive text function for part of it…that’s AI. Should we disclose that?

If the content is AI generated without human intervention, there will be no need to say so—it’ll be very clear (to the reader and to Google).

Yes. You're not doing the work and usually the quality suffers for it. It's different if you're using a spell check or camera - but if you use input by something like ChatGPT or AI generated images than you should definitely disclose such a thing. Especially with images, you are straight up fooling people who don't know any better.

I think people are still trying to work out where the line is. That line will probably continue to shift as new uses for AI develop and people become more comfortable with its use.

At present, there is a distinction that could be drawn between using standard AI tools and generative AI. But I anticipate the next generation of tools will combine the two so that the user will no longer be able to identify which one was used for a particular project. (e.g., when your grammar checker begins rewriting sentences using generative AI rather than standard algorithms.)

I think not, because there are times when they can't be recognized. I have my own written text that AI detectors says its AI.

As long as you're providing value to the reader through your content, it doesn't matter if it's written by AI or a mix of everything. The question should be- is AI generated content helping?

Disclose it! Imagine finding out your favorite influencer's cat is an AI-generated masterpiece.
