{"argument": "The violent retribution, such as the death penalty, vigilante justice, and prison violence, is morally wrong.

The justice should focus on rehabilitation, protecting society, and deterring future crime, rather than punishment.\n", "cmdr_websearch": "While the argument against violent retribution raises valid points, it oversimplifies the concept of \"desert\" in retributive justice. According to Kant, punishment should be proportional to the criminal's inner wickedness, allowing for flexibility and considering the motive and intent of the wrongdoer. Furthermore, alternatives to violent retribution, such as community corrections and drug courts, have been found to effectively control and treat offending behavior, suggesting that rehabilitation and deterrence can be achieved without resorting to violent punishment.", "questions": {"question": ["Can violent retribution ever be morally justified?", "How accurate are criminal convictions?", "Does violent punishment deter criminals?", "What are the potential harms of violent punishment?", "Are there alternative approaches to justice that are more effective than punishment?"]}, "qa_context": "- According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, the concept of retributive justice is best understood as a form of justice committed to three principles: 1) that those who commit certain kinds of wrongful acts, paradigmatically serious crimes, morally deserve to suffer a proportionate punishment; 2) that it is intrinsically morally good for a legitimate punisher to give them the punishment they deserve; and 3) that it is morally impermissible to intentionally punish the innocent or to inflict disproportionately large punishments on wrongdoers.\n- The idea of retributive justice has played a dominant role in theorizing about punishment over the past few decades, but many features of it\u2014especially the notions of desert and proportionality, the normative status of suffering, and the ultimate justification for retribution\u2014remain contested and problematic.\n- According to David Lyons, retribution is giving people what they deserve, hitting them back with equal force to a blow they have struck, and treating someone as they have treated others. A classic legal statement often put forth by retributionists is: lex talionis, which means \"an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, and a life for a life\".\n- Immanuel Kant takes into account the attitude or motive of the wrongdoer. This makes retribution more flexible than lex talionis as it would allow that unintentional crimes warrant less punishment than intentional ones.\n- According to Guus Duindam, Kant argues that punishments must be proportional to the criminal\u2019s \u201cinner wickedness\u201d.\n- According to Ted Wrigley, the only time vigilantism might make sense morally is under conditions of such social and political breakdown that legitimate authority disappears or is rendered impotent.\n- According to mudskipper, the main ethical principle in vigilante justice is the lex talionis. At least in the eyes of the vigilantes, this morally justifies their actions or attempts to enact justice.\n- According to Jo Wehler, the only legal way is to apply to a higher court, e.g., the International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands.\n- According to Miss Understands, in Utilitarianism, it depends on the case. One one hand, state structures are - if they are even trying or capable - slow at enforcing justice. So vigilante justice is a good remedy to this, as executing more justice generally improves societal happiness / wellbeing. - According to a 2012 Department of Justice survey, state criminal history repositories contain over 100 million records, popularly known as \"rap sheets\" or \"criminal records\".

Prisons may even have the opposite effect, as inmates can learn more effective crime strategies from each other and become desensitized to the threat of future imprisonment.\n- The presence of police officers has been found to be effective at deterring crime, as criminals are more likely to be influenced by the increased perception of being caught.\n- Increasing the severity of punishment does little to deter crime.\n- There is no evidence that the death penalty deters criminals. - Physical punishment can lead to physical abuse and cause physical injury.\n- It can have similar negative outcomes to child abuse, such as mental health issues, emotional challenges, lower cognitive ability, lower self-esteem, aggression, antisocial behaviour and negative relationships with parents.\n- It can negatively affect brain development.\n- It can lead to anxiety, depression, substance abuse and antisocial behaviours in adulthood.\n- It can be linked to intimate partner violence as an adult and an increased risk of physical abuse.\n- It can increase children's behavioural problems over time and has no positive outcomes.\n- It is linked to a range of negative outcomes across countries and cultures, including physical and mental ill-health, impaired cognitive and socio-emotional development, poor educational outcomes, increased aggression and perpetration of violence.\n- It is a violation of children's rights to respect for physical integrity and human dignity, health, development, education and freedom from torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\n- It can cause direct physical harm, sometimes resulting in severe damage, long-term disability or death.\n- It can cause mental ill-health, including behavioural and anxiety disorders, depression, hopelessness, low self-esteem, self-harm and suicide attempts, alcohol and drug dependency, hostility and emotional instability, which can continue into adulthood.\n- It can impair cognitive and socio-emotional development, specifically emotion regulation and conflict-solving skills.\n- It can damage educational outcomes, including school dropout and lower academic and occupational success.\n- It can cause poor moral internalisation and increased antisocial behaviour.\n- It can increase aggression in children.\n- It can lead to adult perpetration of violent, antisocial and criminal behaviour.\n- It can cause indirect physical harm due to overloaded biological systems, including developing cancer, alcohol-related problems, migraine, cardiovascular disease, arthritis and obesity that continue into adulthood.\n- It can increase acceptance and use of other forms of violence.\n- It can damage family relationships.\n- It can cause a strain in the family or community. - Restorative justice is a set of principles and practices that respond to criminal behavior with goals of restitution and resolution, rather than focusing on retribution.\n- Community corrections, which is already a part of Australia's criminal justice system, has been found to effectively control and treat offending behavior.\n- Drug courts in Australia have been found to reduce recidivism more effectively than conventional custodial sentences.\n- A survey of European nations shows extensive use of alternatives to incarceration, with plans in most countries for further extension of noncustodial treatment.\n- Noncustodial sentences are more effective than imprisonment in reducing recidivism.", "counter-argument": "3\tIn certain situations, violent retribution can be seen as a redeeming act, such as when a wife, who has been physically and emotionally abused by her husband for 20 years, devises a violent death for him as a means of reclaiming her independence and individuality.

In England and Wales, adverse inferences can be drawn from an accused person's silence during questioning, but this is not the case in Scotland.\n- In Canada, the right to silence is protected under the common law confessions rule, and sections 7 and 11(c) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n- In New Zealand, the right of persons arrested to refrain from making a statement is contained in the Bill of Rights Act 1990.\n- In India, the right against self-incrimination is guaranteed under Article 20 (3) of the Constitution.\n- In China, the right to silence is not guaranteed by law, but Article 15 of the Criminal Procedure Law prohibits the extortion of confessions by torture or other illegal means.\n- In Bangladesh, Article 35(4) of the Constitution protects individuals from self-implication, and warnings must be read out before a voluntary confession is given. ## Arguments for invalidating confessions obtained through torture:\n- Torture is morally repugnant and inhumane, and its use replaces the rule of law with terror.\n- Torture is an ineffective and counterproductive means of gathering accurate information as it frequently generates false or misleading information and impairs subsequent information collection.\n- Torture damages the areas of the brain that recall information.\n- Confessions obtained through torture are not reliable because people will say anything to make the pain stop.\n- Torture does not work.\n- The use of torture destroys people, corrodes the rule of law, undermines the criminal justice system and erodes public trust in public institutions and the state they represent.\n- Torture causes severe pain and suffering to victims which continue long after the acts of torture stop.\n- Torture violates the procedural right to a fair trial.\n- Torture violates international law.\n- Torture violates the right against self-incrimination.\n- Torture violates the right to freedom from torture.\n\n## Arguments against invalidating confessions obtained through torture:\n- Confessions obtained through torture can be used to implicate another person in a crime.\n- Confessions obtained through torture can be used as evidence against a person other than the victim of torture.\n- Confessions obtained through torture can be used in a variety of situations.\n- Confessions obtained through torture can be used to exert a witness statement for use in proceedings against another person.\n- Confessions obtained through torture can be used to obtain statements implicating another person in a crime.\n- Confessions obtained through torture can be used as evidence in court proceedings.\n- Confessions obtained through torture can be used against the tortured person.", "counter-argument": "7\tI argue that allowing defendants to choose whether to testify is crucial because juries may unfairly judge them based on factors like appearance, voice, or emotional control, which can increase the risk of wrongful convictions.

Stinson, a criminal justice professor at Bowling Green State University, only a handful of police officers are charged with murder or manslaughter every year.\n- Between 2005 and 2020, 110 law enforcement officers were charged with murder or manslaughter in an on-duty shooting, despite around 1,000 people being fatally shot by police annually.\n- Of those 110 officers, 42 were convicted, 50 were not, and 18 cases are still pending.\n- In most years, the number of officers charged with murder or manslaughter in connection with an on-duty shooting is in the single digits.\n- Police officers' contracts often protect them from interrogation techniques used on civilians.\n- In the US, governments shall ensure that arbitrary or abusive use of force and firearms by law enforcement officials is punished as a criminal offence. - Implicit bias refers to the automatic association people make between groups and stereotypes about those groups.\n- Implicit bias influences behavior and can cause people to act in biased ways even when they are not explicitly prejudiced.\n- Research suggests that implicit bias influences the outcomes of interactions between police and citizens, contributing to practices that focus undue suspicion on some groups and presume innocence for others.\n- Implicit bias can lead to \"shooter bias\", where police are more likely to shoot unarmed Black suspects than white ones, and higher rates of police stops for minority groups.\n- Implicit bias can also be seen in the legal system, with public defenders prioritizing cases involving white defendants.\n- Implicit bias training is designed to help officers recognize and address their personal biases to prevent biased treatment of citizens.\n- While many police departments offer implicit bias training, evaluations of its effectiveness are limited, and there is currently no evidence that it reduces biases in police activities and interactions.\n- Addressing implicit bias through departmental culture and changing behavioral norms may be more effective than training alone. - A study by Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions and Vanderbilt University found that between 2015 and 2020, 29% of people non-fatally injured in police shootings were non-Hispanic Black, compared to 26% in a 2015 study of fatal police shootings.\n- The Washington Post found that although half of the people shot and killed by police are White, Black Americans are shot at a disproportionate rate.

They also hold prominent positions in the workforce and civil society, breaking stereotypes and advancing gender equality.\n- In Saudi Arabia, women have gained the right to drive and travel without male guardianship. They are increasingly transitioning from homemakers to major players in the country's socio-economic development, with growing participation in sectors like finance, education, and even the military.\n- In Qatar, women have achieved near-universal literacy rates and a notable presence in higher education. Qatari women now have a 58.1% rate of participation in the workforce, breaking into high-level professional roles.\n- In Iran, women have made significant strides in literacy and education, with the female literacy rate increasing from about 35% in the 1970s to over 80% in the early 21st century. However, they continue to face challenges in employment and political participation due to discriminatory laws and societal norms.\n- In Tunisia, women have achieved equal rights as men, outlawing polygamy and granting Muslim women the right to marry non-Muslim men.\n- In Egypt, women gained the right to vote in 1956 and have an active feminist movement.\n- In Lebanon, women have the right to vote and run for office, and the country has a large feminism movement with NGOs like Kafa and Abaad advocating for women's rights. - Kurds are an Iranic ethnic group native to the mountainous region of Kurdistan in West Asia, which spans southeastern Turkey, northwestern Iran, northern Iraq, and northern Syria.\n- Kurds are the fourth-largest ethnic group in the Middle East, but they have never obtained a permanent nation-state.\n- Kurds have historically been subject to harsh treatment, resettlement, and suppression of their language and customs by the authorities of the countries in which they are settled.\n- Kurdish nationalism emerged as a reaction to the changes taking place in mainstream Turkey, primarily the radical secularization, the centralization of authority, and the rampant Turkish nationalism in the new Turkish Republic.\n- Kurdish political parties can be directly traced to the nationalist movements in the Middle East after World War I.\n- Kurdish nationalists have long been suppressed by Turkey and in the states of Iran, Iraq, and Syria, all of whom have fear of a potential independent Kurdistan.\n- Kurdish nationalists have demanded political autonomy or outright independence for Kurds, as well as the recognition of a Kurdistan state without interference from Turkish or Persian authorities.\n- Kurdish groups sought self-determination and the confirmation of Kurdish autonomy in the 1920 Treaty of S\u00e8vres, but this was prevented by Kemal Atat\u00fcrk.\n- Kurds in Turkey have been promised autonomy by successive governments, but each time the promise is unfulfilled, the Kurds then revolt and the revolt is brutally put down, resulting in the destruction of Kurdish villages and the massacre and maiming of people.\n- In Iraq, from the 1950s to the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s, a pattern and cycle emerged: an Iraqi leader would promise autonomy to the Kurds, the Kurds would support the new leader, after the new leader consolidated their power, he would renege on his promise to the Kurds for autonomy and the Kurds would revolt, resulting in violent repression.\n- In Iran, the new theocratic government developed a new exclusionary conception of nationalism based on very conservative Shia Islam. Once Khomeini consolidated power, he expelled Sunni Kurds from government office, placed restrictions on freedom of expression, and militarized Kurdish regions.\n- In Syria, many Kurds consider the Kurdish-majority regions of northern and northeastern Syria to be Western Kurdistan and seek political autonomy within Syria (akin to Iraqi Kurdistan in Iraq) or outright independence as part of an independent Kurdistan.\n- In the diaspora, Kurdish nationalists in the diaspora have played a crucial role in the development of Kurdish nationalism, promoting the idea of suffering, human rights abuses, and their right to statehood. ## Iran\n- Human rights record: \n  - Women are being sent to the gallows in alarming numbers, with Iran imposing a draconian new hijab law.\n- There is a surge in executions, with growing political executions now including women.\n- Iran is committing crimes against humanity during the Woman, Life, Freedom crackdown.\n- There are growing restrictions and punishments that do not follow international human rights norms, such as harsh penalties for crimes, punishment of victimless crimes, restrictions on freedom of speech and the press, and restrictions on freedom of religion.\n- There are also \"extrajudicial\" actions that do not follow Iranian law, such as firebombings of newspaper offices, and beatings, torture, rape, and killing without trial of political prisoners and dissidents/civilians.\n- Political ideology: \n  - Iran operates as an Islamic theocracy, with Shia Islam as the state religion.\n  - The government is supervised by a supreme leader, with an appointed and unelected Guardian Council made up of Islamic jurists.\n  - The government has been described as combining \"the ideological bent of totalitarianism with the limited pluralism of authoritarianism\".\n  - The Islamic Republic Party was Iran's ruling and only legal political party until its dissolution in 1987. Since then, supporters have reorganised themselves as \"principalists\", along with the \"reformists\", becoming two of the major political factions in the country.\n\n## Syria\n- Human rights record: \n  - There is a history of human rights abuses under various governments dating back to French colonial rule in the 1920s.\n  - During the Great Revolt, French military forces sieged much of Damascus and the countryside, killing at least 7,000 rebels and displacing over 100,000 civilians.\n  - Jews in Syria have faced discrimination since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, with restrictions on their movement and ownership of property.\n  - The Ba'athist era (1963-2024) saw large-scale confiscation of properties, state-directed redistribution of lands and wealth, massive censorship, elimination of independent publishing centres, and nationalisation of banks, the education system, and industries.\n  - Under the rule of General Hafez al-Assad, the country was effectively a police state, with repressive measures ranging from censorship to violent methods of state terror such as mass murders, deportations, and torture.\n  - In 1982, Hafez al-Assad responded to an insurrection in Hama by sending a paramilitary force that killed between 10,000 and 55,000 civilians, including women and children.\n  - Under Bashar al-Assad, the country was characterised by systemic violence and repression, with civil liberties and political freedoms severely restricted.\n  - Security forces have arrested and detained individuals without just cause, held prisoners in lengthy pretrial and incommunicado detention, and tortured and physically abused prisoners and detainees.\n  - There are significant restrictions on freedom of speech, press, assembly, and association.\n  - Various torture techniques have been deployed in Syrian detention centres and prisons, including routine beatings, rapes, sexual violence, and \"Bisat al-rih\" (flying carpet).\n- Political ideology: \n  - Syria is currently in a transitional period led by a Syrian transitional government, with a planned permanent government to be established by 2026.\n  - The previous government consisted of a President, a Prime Minister, and a legislative council with 250 seats.\n  - The Syrian constitution of 2012 introduced a multi-party system without guaranteed leadership of any political party.\n  - Syria's judicial branches include the Supreme Constitutional Court, the High Judicial Council, the Court of Cassation, and the State Security Courts, with Islamic jurisprudence as a main source of legislation. ## Kurdish Unification\n- Kurds are a stateless people, comprising a significant minority in Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria. \n- Kurds have historically faced suppression of their nationalist movements and cultural rights by Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria, who fear the establishment of an independent Kurdistan. \n- Kurds in Iraq and Syria have autonomous regions, while Kurds in Turkey and Iran have been subject to more assimilationist pressures. \n- Kurds in Turkey have been denied the right to education in their mother tongue and have faced discrimination and \"otherization\" in society. \n- Kurds in Iran have historically enjoyed more ethnolinguistic and cultural ties with Persians and other Iranian peoples, and many Iranian dynasties are considered to be of partial Kurdish origin. \n\n## Internal Ideological Conflicts\n- Kurds are a diverse group with varying dialects, religions, and political ideologies. \n- Kurds in Turkey have historically faced suppression of their nationalist movements and cultural rights by Turkey, who fear the establishment of an independent Kurdistan. \n- The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) is a Kurdish militant organization that has waged an armed struggle against the Turkish state for cultural and political rights and self-determination for the Kurds. The PKK has been labelled a terrorist organization by Turkey, the US, the EU, and NATO, while the UN, Switzerland, and Russia have refused to add the PKK to their terrorist lists. \n- The PKK has committed atrocities against Kurdish clans that were against them. \n- Kurds in Iraq have experienced internal conflict between the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), resulting in a bloody civil war in the mid-1990s. \n- Kurds in Syria have been divided between the Kurdish National Council, which is affiliated with the Kurdistan Democratic Party in Iraqi Kurdistan, and the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES), which seeks the federalization of Syria. - The US has had a long history of military alliances with the Kurds, dating back to the 1970s. The Kurds have been a US ally in the fight against ISIS and in the invasion of Iraq in 2003. \n- The US has also provided military aid to the Kurds, including air strikes, weapons, and advisers.\n- However, the Kurds have also experienced abandonment by the US, such as in 2019 when US troops pulled back from the border with Turkey, allowing Turkey to launch an offensive against the Kurds. \n- Turkey has also had a complex relationship with the Kurds, marked by intermittent cooperation and conflict. \n- Turkey has long opposed Kurdish independence and has launched military offensives against Kurdish groups, such as the PKK, which it considers a terrorist organization. \n- The UK and Germany have also been accused of turning a blind eye to the humanitarian crisis caused by Turkey's offensive in Afrin, Syria, in 2018. \n- Overall, the outcomes of Western nations' alliances with the Kurds have been mixed, with periods of cooperation and support, as well as abandonment and conflict.", "counter-argument": "31\tThe Kurds are motivated by self-interest and material gains, and would cooperate with ISIS if it benefited them. Western support for the Kurds is complicated by the fact that a Kurdish state would require the surrender of land from Iraq, Turkey, and Syria, and that Western media has a pro-Western bias that oversimplifies and misrepresents the situation in the Middle East.\n"}

However, according to sources, lying to the FBI is a common way for someone to face a federal false statement charge.\n- The Department of Justice states that it is their policy not to charge a violation in situations where a suspect merely denies guilt in response to questioning by the government. - A felony is punishable by a year or more in state or federal prison, whereas a misdemeanour is punishable by 364 days or less in county jail.\n- Felons may lose their rights to vote, own firearms, seek professional licenses, and hold public office.\n- A misdemeanour usually involves some jail time, smaller fines, and temporary punishments.\n- Felonies are the most serious crimes and carry long prison sentences, fines, and potentially permanent loss of freedom. - Federal prosecutors can use the threat of a false statements charge to gain leverage against someone they believe has information important to their case.\n- The threat of charging someone with a felony for making a false statement can be used by the government to gain leverage in a case.\n- A false statements charge can be added to another criminal charge, such as fraud or embezzlement. - Making false statements is a federal crime under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, punishable by up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.\n- However, some sources suggest that there is no punishment for merely denying guilt when questioned by the FBI or other federal agents.\n- Several notable people have been convicted under this law, including Martha Stewart, Rod Blagojevich, Michael T. Flynn, Rick Gates, Scooter Libby, Bernard Madoff, and Jeffrey Skilling.", "counter-argument": "33\tLying to the FBI is not a crime if the lie does not matter and believes the penalty should be less severe, like a misdemeanor. However, I acknowledge that this view could encourage people to lie in legal investigations and that the materiality requirement in the law acts as a safeguard to prevent abuse. Proper use of the 5th amendment and having a lawyer present during FBI questioning can help mitigate potential problems with the law.\n"}

The United States is the only country to have used atomic bombs, dropping them on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.\n- Since then, the Soviet Union (1949), the United Kingdom (1952), France (1960), and the People's Republic of China (1964) have also developed nuclear weapons.\n- India (1974) and Pakistan (1998) have also developed nuclear weapons. \n- Israel and North Korea are also thought to possess nuclear weapons, but it is not known how many. - The US has refused to adopt a \"no first use\" policy and says it reserves the right to use nuclear weapons first in the case of conflict.\n- The US President can launch nuclear weapons at any time for any reason without checks from other branches of the government.\n- The US policy states that nuclear weapons could be used in extreme circumstances to defend the vital interests of the United States or its allies and partners.\n- The US has rejected a sole purpose policy, which would have declared that the sole purpose of nuclear weapons is to deter a nuclear attack against the US or its allies. - No, atomic bombs have not been used since World War II.\n- The only use of nuclear weapons in armed conflict occurred in 1945 when the US dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n- Since World War II, nuclear weapons have been developed by the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France, the People's Republic of China, India, Pakistan, Israel, and North Korea. - The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) or the Nuclear Weapon Ban Treaty, which entered into force on 22 January 2021.\n- The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), signed in 1968.", "counter-argument": "40\tThe US is the most trustworthy country to possess nuclear weapons due to its large military, stable government, and legitimacy as a state. In contrast, semi-failed states like Sudan, Nigeria, and Tunisia would be more dangerous with nuclear weapons as they could easily fall into the hands of terrorists. The US's use of atomic bombs in WWII is not comparable to the present day, as the weapons are much more powerful now and the country has a plethora of other options, making nuclear power a last resort.\n"}
{"argument": "I am a self-described socially liberal individual, I think the social justice warrior (SJW) movement uses language that is exclusive to the elite and privileged, making it inaccessible to those who are economically and educationally marginalized. This language, which includes terms such as \"patriarchy\" and \"cisgendered,\" can be intimidating and alienating to those who are not familiar with it, and can make them feel stupid or ignorant. I believe that this approach does more to silence non-privileged voices than to encourage education, empowerment, and progress.\n", "cmdr_websearch": "While it is important to acknowledge that specialized language can sometimes act as a barrier, social media platforms provide a space for marginalized communities to connect, share experiences, and educate themselves and others. These online spaces facilitate the dissemination of information, allowing individuals to learn about concepts like \"patriarchy\" and \"cisgender,\" and empowering them to find their own voices in the process.", "questions": {"question": ["How does the language of social justice activism include and empower marginalized communities?", "What are the origins of terms like 'patriarchy' and 'cisgender' and how have they evolved in social justice discourse?", "Are there studies showing the impact of social justice language on feelings of inclusion/exclusion among economically disadvantaged groups?", "How do social justice activists respond to the claim that their language is alienating to the uneducated?", "What are alternative frameworks or theories that address social inequality without using exclusive language?"]}, "qa_context": "- Social media platforms provide marginalized communities with a space to connect and organize, allowing them to amplify their voices, spread awareness, and increase their visibility.\n- Social media helps to document and share narratives and lived experiences of marginalized individuals and groups, exposing and addressing racial violence, sexual harassment, and other forms of oppression.\n- Social media facilitates collaboration and coordination, enabling marginalized communities to plan and promote events, protests, and rallies, and to quickly disseminate information to a wider audience.\n- Social media platforms can be used to educate and inform people about social justice issues, promoting empathy, understanding, and respect for different communities.\n- Social media helps to build and strengthen connections between diverse groups, fostering dialogue, and creating a sense of community.\n- Social media can be a powerful tool for advocacy, enabling marginalized communities to influence policies, challenge systemic barriers, and drive legislative and social change. - The term 'patriarchy' comes from the Greek \"\u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2\" (patriarkh\u0113s), meaning \"father or chief of a race\". It is a social system that came into being around 10-12 thousand years ago, coinciding with the advent of agriculture.\n- The term 'cisgender' was coined in 1994 by Dana Defosse, then a graduate student, in a Usenet newsgroup about transgender topics. It was added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2015, and is defined as \"a person whose sense of personal identity and gender corresponds to their sex at birth\". The prefix \"cis-\" comes from Latin and means \"on this side of\", which is the opposite of \"trans-\", meaning \"across from\" or \"on the other side of\". - The World Bank's report on social inclusion highlights the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the most marginalised groups, including the elderly, unemployed youth, and ethnic and racial minorities.\n- The World Bank's report also mentions that the exclusion of disadvantaged groups can be costly, leading to a loss of wages, poor education, and adverse employment outcomes.\n- The World Bank's report further emphasises the need to address the root causes of structural exclusion and discrimination to achieve sustainable inclusive growth and rapid poverty reduction.\n- The American Psychological Association's Inclusive Language Guide acknowledges the power of language and explains why certain terms are harmful to marginalised communities.\n- The guide also provides recommendations for using inclusive language to promote equity, diversity, and inclusion.\n- Investopedia's article on social justice mentions that social justice refers to a fair and equitable division of resources, opportunities, and privileges in society.\n- The article also highlights that social justice advocates focus on addressing historical injustices and directing resources to underserved communities to establish a more fair and equal society.\n- The article \"Issues of Race, Equity, and Social Justice\" mentions the impact of racial trauma and inequality on ethnic minority families, leading to increased trauma and violence exposure, economic hardship, and limited access to quality services. - Social justice activists have argued that the use of specific terms like \u201coppression,\u201d \u201ctone policing,\u201d \u201cemotional labor,\u201d \u201cdiversity,\u201d and \u201callyship\u201d is necessary to draw attention to the plight of marginalized people. \n- However, they acknowledge that the meanings of these terms can also be manipulated to attack and exclude people, and that this can be alienating to those who don't have access to the rapidly evolving lexicon of social justice. \n- Some activists have expressed concern that the \"call-out culture\" prevalent in activist communities can become a default response to dissenting ideas, rather than being used to address harmful behavior. This can lead to the alienation of potential allies and members. \n- Activists have also pointed out that the expectation of ideological purity and the use of \u201cactivist jargon\u201d can create a hostile environment for those who hold differing views, even if they share the same broader goals and causes. - **Conflict Theory** - This theory, created by Karl Marx, views social inequality as the main source of conflict among humans. Marx and Friedrich Engels conceptualised two classes of capitalism based on ownership: the bourgeoisie (owners of the means of production) and the proletariat (those who sell their labour). Conflict theorists argue that this power imbalance is the basis of all social conflict.\n- **Critical Race Theory (CRT)** - Developed by legal scholars in the 1980s, CRT asserts that racism is endemic in the laws, policies and institutions of the US. CRT examines society through the lens of power and oppression, and how cultural changes benefit certain groups.\n- **Market-Oriented Theories** - These theories argue that supply and demand will regulate prices and wages, and stabilise inequality. When supply meets demand, prices reach a state of equilibrium. Over time, low wages will induce people to learn new skills, reducing the pool of agricultural labourers and raising wages.\n- **Dependency Theory** - This theory states that colonialism and neocolonialism have created unequal economic relations between poor and wealthy countries. Wealthy nations have exploited poor countries in the past and continue to do so through foreign debt and foreign trade.\n- **World Systems Theory** - Developed by Immanuel Wallerstein, this theory suggests that there is a world economic system in which some countries benefit while others are exploited. Wallerstein identifies three types of countries: core (dominant capitalist countries that exploit peripheral countries), periphery (dependent on core countries for capital), and semi-periphery (sharing characteristics of both core and peripheral countries).\n- **State-Centered Theories** - These theories propose that the government should regulate the distribution of resources to protect workers. Socialist and communist economic systems, for example, operate on the premise that inequality is best addressed by the state.", "counter-argument": "42\tGentrification is a term coined by sociologists to describe a specific phenomenon, not a \"social justice warrior\" (SJW) term. The vocabulary used in social justice discussions is not elitist, but rather a specialized language meant to facilitate discussion among those familiar with the concepts, and it's not unreasonable to expect people to be familiar with basic terminology when discussing a subject. \n"}

For example, avocados, almonds, and cashew nuts require a lot of water to grow.\n- A vegan diet can also lead to environmental pressures on certain ingredients, such as almonds, avocados, and cocoa, which require a lot of water, fertilisers, and pesticides to grow.\n- The environmental impact of a vegan diet also depends on how the food is grown and transported. For example, air-transported fruit and vegetables can create more greenhouse gas emissions per kilogram than poultry meat.\n\n## Meat-Eating\n- Meat production has a large carbon footprint, with livestock contributing to around 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions.\n- Red meat, such as beef, has a particularly high carbon footprint, with emissions ten times higher than poultry, such as chicken.\n- Dairy also has a high environmental impact, contributing to a quarter of dietary emissions for vegetarians.\n- Cattle farming can also contribute to soil erosion and carbon emissions, as cow dung can add nutrients and microbes to the soil and lock in carbon.\n- A flexitarian diet, which includes a small amount of meat, may be more realistic and achievable for people than a vegan diet, which can be restrictive. - Meat is a source of essential nutrients, including protein, iron, zinc, and vitamin B12.\n- Meat consumption is associated with an increased risk of chronic illnesses such as colorectal cancer, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes.\n- The association between meat consumption and health risks persists after accounting for factors like age, race, BMI, smoking, blood pressure, and lipid levels.\n- The impact of meat consumption on health is influenced by the type of meat (red meat vs. white meat), the way it is processed (industrial vs. home-cooked), and the overall diet and meal composition.\n- Industrial processing of meat involves curing, smoking, and drying, which can increase shelf life and flavor but may also introduce preservatives and carcinogenic compounds.\n- Fermented meat products may have potential health benefits due to the formation of bioactive peptides and the presence of probiotic bacteria.\n- Confounding factors, such as dietary quality and substitution effects, make it challenging to establish a direct link between meat consumption and health outcomes.\n- Well-designed randomized controlled trials and validated biomarkers are needed to better understand the relationship between meat consumption and human health.", "counter-argument": "56\tAnimals lack the self-awareness to understand morality, so killing them isn't murder.

Social cohesion is a complex and dynamic concept that is difficult to define and measure. It has been studied from various perspectives, including theoretical, empirical, experimental, and social network analysis. While there is no universally agreed-upon definition, social cohesion generally refers to the degree of unity, solidarity, and social bonds within a society or community. It encompasses factors such as strong social bonds and trust, a sense of belonging and identification, and an orientation towards the common good. \n\nSocial cohesion has been studied at three levels: the individual, community, and institutional levels. At the individual level, it involves factors such as intimate face-to-face communication, task competence, and individual behaviour. The community level includes aspects like social networks, shared norms and values, and group performance and goal attainment. The institutional level focuses on conflict management, decision-making, human rights, and the role of formal institutions in promoting or hindering social cohesion. \n\nResearch on the impact of ethnic diversity on social cohesion has yielded mixed results. Some studies suggest that ethnic diversity negatively affects social cohesion, particularly intra-community cohesion, while others find no significant relationship. The evidence is inconclusive, and the impact may depend on various factors such as the specific indicators of social cohesion being measured, the geographic scale of analysis, and the cultural and historical context. \n\nOverall, social cohesion is a complex and multifaceted concept that is challenging to define and measure precisely. It operates at multiple levels and is influenced by a range of factors, including ethnic diversity, socioeconomic factors, and institutional structures. - Research shows that the likelihood of being caught is a much more powerful deterrent than the punishment itself.\n- Sending convicted criminals to prison is not a very effective way to deter crime.

{"argument": "Both libertarianism and communism are based on the flawed assumption that people are not selfish. In reality, humans are self-serving, and without financial incentives, entrepreneurs and skilled workers will seek opportunities elsewhere, and charity alone cannot replace government programs for the poor. A combination of capitalism and tax-funded social services is a more practical and desirable model for a society.\n", "cmdr_websearch": "While it is true that both libertarianism and communism emphasize the importance of collective welfare, they do not deny the existence of self-interest. Libertarianism, for instance, seeks to reduce state power and promote individual liberty, which includes the freedom to pursue self-interest. Communism, on the other hand, aims for common ownership and equitable distribution, but it does not assume that people will always act altruistically, which is why it often involves a strong central authority to enforce its ideals.", "questions": {"question": ["What are the core principles of libertarianism and communism, and how do they view human nature?", "Is altruism a driving force in society, and can it sustain communist ideals?", "How does selfishness or self-interest play out in a capitalist system?", "What are the potential consequences of removing financial incentives in a libertarian society?", "Can charity effectively address the needs of the poor, and what are the limitations?"]}, "qa_context": "## Libertarianism\n- Libertarianism is a political philosophy that holds freedom and liberty as its primary values. \n- Libertarians advocate for the expansion of individual autonomy and political self-determination, emphasising the principles of equality before the law and the protection of civil rights. \n- They generally support individual liberty and oppose authority, state power, warfare, militarism, and nationalism, but some libertarians diverge on the scope and nature of their opposition to existing economic and political systems. \n- Libertarianism has been shaped by liberal ideas, and can be traced back to the higher-law concepts of the Greeks and Israelites, and Christian theologians. \n- Libertarianism originated in the mid-19th century as a form of anti-authoritarian and anti-state politics, usually seen as being on the left. \n- Libertarianism has been associated with right-wing politics due to its development in 20th-century America, but it is also viewed as an independent, anti-authoritarian philosophy. \n- Libertarianism includes several schools of thought, including anarcho-capitalism, minarchism, and libertarian socialism. \n- Libertarianism is a theory that upholds individual rights above all else and seeks to reduce the power of the state. \n\n## Communism\n- Communism is a sociopolitical, philosophical, and economic ideology within the socialist movement, whose goal is the creation of a communist society. \n- Communism seeks a common ownership of the means of production, distribution, and exchange, and the allocation of products to everyone in society based on need. \n- Communists often seek a voluntary state of self-governance but disagree on the means to this end, reflecting a distinction between libertarian socialist and authoritarian socialist approaches. \n- Communism includes several schools of thought, including Marxist, Leninist, and libertarian communist schools. \n- Communism is based on the analysis that the current order of society stems from capitalism and its economic system, and that this situation can only be resolved through a social revolution. \n- Communism has been associated with authoritarianism and bureaucracy, and the inherent inefficiencies of communist economies. \n- Communism emerged in its modern form in 18th-century France, and in the 20th century, several Communist governments came into power, first in the Soviet Union and then in portions of Eastern Europe, Asia, and elsewhere. \n- Communism has been criticised for promoting \"atomistic\" individualism, and for its association with mass killings and authoritarian regimes. \n- Communism has been defended as a theory that emphasises the need for social equality and common ownership, and for its positive impact on social mobility, equality, and universal access to essential services. ## Is altruism a driving force in society?\n- Studies have shown that people's first impulse is to cooperate rather than compete.\n- Toddlers spontaneously help people in need out of a genuine concern for their welfare.\n- Even non-human primates display altruism.\n- Altruism is an important moral value in many cultures and religions.\n- Altruism is good for our health: people who volunteer tend to experience fewer aches and pains, better overall physical health, and less depression.\n- Altruism is good for our bottom line: studies suggest that altruists may reap unexpected financial benefits from their kindness.\n- Altruism is contagious: research has shown that it can spread by three degrees\u2014from person to person to person to person.\n\n## Can altruism sustain communist ideals?\n- Communism desired an altruistic society, where your ration equaled your basic need regardless of your efforts.\n- In an altruistic society, the most successful members immolate themselves to benefit those incapable or unwilling to succeed on their own merit.\n- In an ideal altruistic state, the giver must not enjoy giving but willfully and actively continue their pinnacle level of production.\n- In practice, this would mean that the harder people worked, the sooner they died, and their families were no better off for it.\n- Human nature will never allow a truly altruistic society. - Critics of capitalism argue that it drives and requires people to become selfish, with the belief that economic progress can only be achieved through \"unabashed selfish motivations\".\n- Adam Smith, often regarded as a champion of self-interest, explains that the greatest economic benefit for all can be accomplished when individuals act in their own self-interest. This is known as the Invisible Hand Theory.\n- Self-interest and competition dominate in capitalist economies where goods and services are exchanged freely.\n- Critics of self-interest in a capitalist system argue that it can lead to corruption and cheating if not regulated by governments.\n- Proponents of self-interest in a capitalist system argue that it is a powerful motivator for economic activity and can lead to innovation.\n- Empathy, not greed, is argued to be the driving force of capitalism, as successful entrepreneurs prioritize the needs of others over their own self-interest. - Removing financial incentives can demotivate people.\n- Financial incentives can be used to drive and sustain rapid performance improvement.\n- Without financial incentives, people may be less inclined to do their jobs as they are not incentivized by money.\n- Financial incentives can lead to unethical behaviour, fuel turnover, and foster envy and discontent.\n- Financial incentives can lead to pay inequality, which can harm performance.\n- Financial incentives can reduce intrinsic motivation.\n- Without financial incentives, there may be less incentive for people to work harder and produce more.\n- Without financial incentives, businesses may be less profitable, and shareholders and owners may receive less money. ## How charity can address the needs of the poor:\n- Direct assistance: providing food, shelter, and medical care to those in need.\n- Addressing root causes: advocating for policies that promote education, employment, and equal opportunities.\n- Community development: building community resilience, fostering social cohesion, and supporting local businesses.\n- Financial donations: providing money to help individuals meet their basic needs.\n- In-kind donations: offering goods and services such as clothing, medical supplies, and professional services.\n- Volunteering: donating time and skills to help with tasks such as meal preparation and distribution, tutoring, and job training.\n\n## Limitations of charity in addressing poverty:\n- Inefficient use of funds: charities may spend a large proportion of their funds on administration and fundraising rather than directly on the needy.\n- Targeting symptoms, not causes: charities often provide stopgap solutions without addressing the underlying causes of poverty.\n- Substitute for justice: charity can be seen as a way to accept and mitigate the consequences of fundamental societal injustices.\n- Failing to change society: charitable giving may distract from finding long-term solutions and necessary systemic change.\n- Benefiting the state: charity can allow the state to escape its responsibilities and shift funding from the public to the private sector, making essential services uncertain and vulnerable to market forces.\n- Favouritism, not fairness: donors may give to causes that appeal to them but are not necessarily the areas of greatest need.\n- Negative impact on tax system: tax incentives for charitable giving can reduce revenue available for state social projects.", "counter-argument": "65\tThe core libertarian claim is not that private charity is more effective than state assistance, but rather that people's selfishness cancels out. Libertarians assume that people are selfish in all situations, including government workers, and therefore favor limiting the power of the government. In contrast, communism is built on the idea that people can act selflessly and donate to society as a whole, which can provide a safety net for those in need.\n"}

However, they can be a hassle to fill out, especially the puzzles. \n- Google's reCAPTCHA is one of the most widely used CAPTCHA services due to its effectiveness and ease of integration. It uses risk analysis techniques and, in some cases, audio or image recognition challenges to separate human users from bots. \n- According to a source, if a site has a form without a CAPTCHA button, it may receive a high influx of spam submissions. \n- CAPTCHAs are automated and require little human maintenance or intervention, making them beneficial in terms of cost and reliability. - Treating spamming as a crime could negatively impact free speech by making it harder for people to express themselves online without fear of repercussions. Anonymity can protect people's identities and allow them to speak freely without fear of retaliation or harm. \n- Online anonymity can be essential for marginalised groups, political activists, and whistleblowers. For example, it can protect LGBTQ+ communities, survivors of abuse, and political dissidents. \n- However, treating spamming as a crime could also have a positive impact on free speech by reducing the amount of unwanted or harmful content online, creating a safer and more inclusive environment for expression. \n- Treating spamming as a crime could negatively impact online anonymity by making it easier for governments and institutions to identify and track individuals, potentially leading to increased surveillance and censorship. \n- On the other hand, it could also have a positive impact on online anonymity by discouraging people from engaging in abusive or manipulative behaviours that take advantage of anonymity, such as trolling or spreading misinformation. - A study by Cleary and Zimmerman found that the choice of learning strategies, learning goals, and self-efficacy insights of novice basketball players affected their self-regulatory forethought, satisfaction, and self-reflection processes.\n- A study by Zimmerman and Martinez-Pons showed that successful learners had more skill in self-regulation than unsuccessful individuals.\n- A study by Dent and Alison found that self-regulated learning is positively correlated with academic achievement.\n- A meta-analysis by Lanqin Z. found that self-regulated learning scaffolds in computer-based learning environments positively impacted academic performance. - Forum spamming is a form of online abuse and harassment that involves posts on internet forums containing related or unrelated advertisements, links to malicious websites, trolling, and abusive or otherwise unwanted information.\n- Forum spamming is usually carried out by automated spambots or manually with the intention of reaching readers who would not otherwise encounter the content.\n- While the prevalence of forum spamming compared to other forms of online abuse and harassment is not clear, it is included in the list of abusive tactics employed by writers and journalists, along with astroturfing, cyberbullying, cyberstalking, deepfake, etc.\n- Social media sites are the most common place for online harassment, with three-quarters of U.S. adults who have recently faced online harassment saying it happened on social media.\n- Forum or discussion sites are the second most common place for online harassment, with 25% of U.S. adults reporting such experiences.", "counter-argument": "66\tDefining \"spam\" in a way that targets spammers without violating free speech rights is nearly impossible.

{"argument": "Welfare recipients should be required to receive IUDs, as it would offer similar advantages to eugenics while resolving ethical concerns.

For example, if it is placed in the cervix instead of higher up in the uterus, it may not be as effective at preventing pregnancy.\n- IUD expulsion is a possible complication, where the device comes out of the uterus by accident. If this happens, the IUD will not prevent pregnancy. ## Historical Implications of Eugenics Programs\n- Eugenics is a set of beliefs and practices that aim to improve the genetic quality of a human population.\n- The contemporary history of eugenics began in the late 19th century in the United Kingdom and then spread to many countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, and most European countries.\n- By the 1920s, eugenics had become a global movement with support from governments, elites, and the general public.\n- Eugenics organizations were formed worldwide to promote the idea of  \"racial improvement\" and  \"planned breeding\" to create a perfect society.\n- Eugenics programs included both positive and negative measures. Positive measures encouraged individuals deemed \"fit\" to reproduce, while negative measures included marriage prohibitions and forced sterilization of those deemed unfit.\n- The most well-known application of eugenics occurred in Nazi Germany, which used its resources to  \"cleanse\" German society of those deemed \"unworthy of life.\" This culminated in the near destruction of the Jewish people and the persecution of other marginalized groups.\n- Eugenics movements also flourished in the United States, with the involuntary sterilization of at least 60,000 people through state laws by the 1970s. These laws disproportionately targeted marginalized communities, including people of color, people with disabilities, and LGBTQ+ individuals.\n\n## Ethical Implications of Eugenics Programs\n- Eugenics is considered immoral and unethical due to its association with scientific racism, ableism, colonialism, and other forms of discrimination.\n- Eugenics theories and practices caused widespread harm, particularly to marginalized populations, and led to human rights violations, including forced sterilization, segregation, and genocide.\n- Eugenics programs infringe on fundamental freedoms and human rights, including the right to reproduce without interference and the principle of equality for all human beings.\n- Eugenics is based on inaccurate and prejudiced interpretations of scientific theories, such as Darwin's theory of evolution and Mendel's laws of inheritance.\n- Eugenics programs involve coercive and authoritarian measures that limit individual freedom and choice, such as forced sterilization and segregation.\n- Eugenics can lead to social inequalities and homogenization, creating an \"overclass\" with unfair advantages and marginalizing those with disabilities or deficiencies.\n- Eugenics programs can result in a loss of genetic diversity, which can have negative consequences for species' long-term survival and resilience.\n\n## Why Eugenics Programs are Generally Considered Unacceptable\n- Eugenics programs are generally considered unacceptable due to their historical association with human rights abuses, scientific racism, and discrimination.\n- The implementation of eugenics practices has caused widespread harm and suffering, particularly to marginalized communities, and is contrary to the fundamental principles of equality, freedom, and human dignity.\n- Eugenics theories are based on inaccurate and prejudiced interpretations of scientific theories and are not supported by genetic studies or scientific evidence.\n- Eugenics programs involve coercive and authoritarian measures that limit individual freedom and choice, which are incompatible with democratic values and human rights. - Religious objections to IUDs may be considered a violation of religious freedom as they can restrict employees' access to contraceptive services, forcing them to either violate their religious beliefs or face fines and penalties. \n- Restricting access to welfare on these grounds may result in employees of religious objectors being unable to obtain contraceptive coverage, which could lead to unwanted pregnancies and affect gender equality. \n- It could also result in employers facing \"crippling\" fines for non-compliance with health insurance requirements, which could burden their religious beliefs. - A study by the National Research Council (US) Committee on Population and Moffitt RA found that the welfare system has a significantly negative effect on marriage and a positive effect on fertility.\n- A review of research by Faraz V Shahidi et al. found that social assistance programs in high-income countries are failing to maintain the health of socioeconomically disadvantaged populations.\n- A study by Shainur Premji and Susan Griffin found that the wider societal impacts framework provides a simple, indirect method to inform resource allocation decisions.\n- A Wikipedia article on welfare spending states that social welfare may be provided through direct cash transfers, subsidies, vouchers, or housing assistance.", "counter-argument": "95\tImplementing IUDs or sterilization for welfare recipients is not only cost-ineffective but also immoral, as it involves an invasive and potentially painful medical procedure with side effects, and denies people their autonomy and dignity. This approach is based on a stereotype that welfare recipients are \"good for nothing wastes of space\", when in fact, many households receive welfare at some point. This approach would be more expensive than the current system, would deny people who are religious access to welfare, and would ultimately be humiliating and dehumanizing.\n"}

Napoleon's conquests spread the liberal ideas of the French Revolution throughout Europe.\n- The Civil Code (also known as the Code Napoleon) abolished feudal privileges and established equality before the law.\n- The Code Napoleon imposed on conquered nations served as the legal basis for much of Continental European law today.\n- The liberal ideals of legal equality spread to Napoleon's opponents, who realised they had to create a more competitive state.\n- The Napoleonic Wars fuelled the energies of liberal opponents, including nationalist movements in Germany and Spain.\n- The Civil Code perpetuated further discrimination against women under the banner of the \"natural order\".\n- Napoleon's regime helped mobilise nationalist movements in opposition to French rule.\n- Napoleon's rule ended democracy in France, but he maintained many liberal reforms. - The Napoleonic Code, or Code Napol\u00e9on, was universally applicable across France.\n- The Code was beneficial in that it established legal equality, the protection of property rights, and the abolition of feudal privileges. \n- It also enshrined individual rights, freedom of belief, and equality before the law. \n- However, the Code did not grant equality to women in the same sense as men, and it re-established the supremacy of husbands over their wives. - Napoleon's educational reforms created a centralised education system, with the Imperial University at its head, controlling all educational institutions and their curricula. \n- The lyc\u00e9es, or secondary schools, were established to provide a standardised education to boys, with a focus on creating skilled administrators and soldiers. \n- The Baccalaureate examination was introduced as the entrance exam for university. \n- Teachers were to be trained and paid for by the state. \n- Education was opened up to girls, with Napoleon recognising the importance of female education. \n- The curriculum was standardised across the nation, with a focus on practical skills and subjects such as mathematics, science, and technical disciplines. \n- Napoleon's educational reforms promoted the use of the French language and literature, fostering a sense of national identity and unity. \n- The reforms aimed to create a unified and skilled citizenry, with education serving the needs of the state. \n- The meritocratic principles introduced by the reforms are still ingrained in the French education system, with education seen as a means of social mobility. \n- The reforms laid the groundwork for the modern French educational system, with lasting impacts on the organisation of education and the principles guiding educational policies. - Napoleon's conquests hindered social and political unity in Europe by overturning the traditional order of society.\n- His conquests cemented the spread of French revolutionary legislation to much of Western Europe, challenging the power of the Roman Catholic Church, guilds, and the manorial aristocracy.\n- The old regime was dead in Belgium, western Germany, and northern Italy.\n- Napoleon's conquests sparked growing nationalism in Germany, Italy, Spain, and Poland.\n- The Congress of Vienna in 1814-1815 attempted to restore the balance of power in Europe and emphasise a conservative political order.\n- The Treaty of Vienna disappointed nationalists and liberals and reinforced the conservative political order in Europe.", "counter-argument": "109\tThe effort to control Europe is ultimately doomed to fail, as seen in the cases of the Romans and Napoleon, who despite being a great leader and general, was unable to sustain his empire due to the separation of Europe into separate nations.

For example, in Florida, the use of deadly force is justifiable when a person reasonably believes that it is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to themselves or others. - Police use of deadly force in response to Molotov cocktails could result in the death of innocent bystanders.\n- The use of deadly force could escalate the situation, leading to more violence and worsening the riot.\n- The use of deadly force could result in the police killing the wrong person, as it can be difficult to identify the perpetrator in a chaotic and crowded environment.\n- Molotov cocktails are not always effective weapons and can be avoided, so the use of deadly force may not be justifiable.\n- The use of deadly force by police could lead to public backlash and negative media coverage, potentially damaging the reputation of the police force.\n- The use of deadly force could result in legal consequences for the police officers involved, as prosecutors may file charges. - Non-lethal weapons: tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets, stun grenades, electric tasers, water cannons, etc. \n- Negotiated management: police and protesters come together before the protest to negotiate what they can and can't do. \n- Command and control: breaking up large groups of protesters before they can consolidate into a single mob. \n- Envelopment (or kettling): police encircle the crowd, containing it and allowing people to leave through a gap in the cordon. \n- Less aggressive tactics: mounted police on horses, or the use of police dogs. I was unable to find any specific psychological factors that influence the use of Molotov cocktails in protests. However, I did find some information on the psychological factors that influence protestor behaviour in general, and the reasons why Molotov cocktails are used in protests.\n\n- **Psychological factors influencing protestor behaviour**: A sense of injustice, moral outrage, and the perception of profiteering are some of the psychological factors that can drive people to participate in protests and riots. For example, during the 2008 food riots in Cameroon, protestors were angry about merchants' profiteering on staple products, which led to broader protests and riots. \n- **Reasons for using Molotov cocktails in protests**: Molotov cocktails are often used as a symbol of resistance and defiance against authority. They are also used due to their simplicity, low cost, and ease of production and deployment. Additionally, the energy density of gasoline in Molotov cocktails makes them a powerful weapon that can have a psychological effect on those inside modern tanks.", "counter-argument": "119\tUsing a Molotov cocktail against another human being is horrific, but it's not the police's job to punish people for their crimes, rather to keep the peace and apprehend criminals. Lethal force should be a last resort, especially in situations where innocent bystanders may be injured, and that police should consider the circumstances before using it. Police should prioritize de-escalation and arrest over lethal force, even in situations where a protester is throwing a Molotov cocktail, in order to avoid fueling further violence and riots.\n"}

As a result, Iceland has had much better economic performance than other austerity cases.\n- Germany experienced sustained growth after the 2008 crisis, as it had continued to invest in its manufacturing industry and had lower rates of home ownership. - Greece's adoption of the euro in 2001 allowed it to borrow at much lower interest rates, despite its deteriorating competitiveness and public finances. \n- In the decade before the crisis, Greece was able to use this cheap funding to finance a deficit which grew to unsustainable levels. \n- Greece's reliance on external financing for funding budget and trade deficits left its economy very vulnerable to shifts in investor confidence. \n- The use of a single currency highlighted a structural difference between Greece and other member countries, notably Germany, and exacerbated the government\u2019s fiscal problems. \n- Greece's entry into the Eurozone was conditional on it keeping its debt-to-GDP ratio well below 60%. However, Greece misreported its finances to join the Eurozone, with a budget deficit well over 3% and a debt level above 100% of GDP. \n- Greece's fiscal problems were not primarily the result of excessive spending, but a lack of revenue due to systematic tax evasion. \n- The Euro Crisis originated in the mismanagement of the monetary windfall enjoyed by countries in the periphery when they adopted the euro.

About three-quarters of children of undocumented immigrants are citizens.\n- Unauthorized immigrants are more likely to be employed in low-wage and low-benefit jobs, which limits their access to the safety net.\n- Unauthorized immigrants are less likely to have employer-sponsored health insurance and pension plans than their U.S.-born peers.\n- Unauthorized immigrants are less likely to receive unemployment insurance than their U.S.-born peers.\n- Unauthorized immigrants are more likely to work unusual hours and are more likely to be employed in dangerous jobs.\n- Unauthorized immigrants are more likely to face administrative barriers to safety net programs, such as complex eligibility requirements, language access gaps, and fear of immigration enforcement. - Research has shown that immigrants in the US commit crimes at lower rates than US-born individuals.\n- Immigrants are 60% less likely to be incarcerated than US-born individuals.\n- Immigrants are 10 times less likely to be incarcerated for committing weapons-related offenses, 5 times less likely for violent offenses, more than twice as likely for property crimes, and nearly twice as likely for drug offenses.\n- A study of Texas, the only US state that records criminal arrests and convictions by immigration status, found that immigrants were arrested at less than half the rate of US-born citizens for violent and drug crimes, and a quarter of the rate for property crimes.\n- Research has shown that immigration does not increase crime rates, and can even lower criminal activity, especially violent crime, in places with inclusive policies and established immigrant populations.\n- A comparison of crime rates in sanctuary cities and \"non-sanctuary cities\" found no difference in violent crime, rape, or property crime rates.\n- A study of crime data from 1980 to 2022 found that as the immigrant share of the population grew, the crime rate declined.\n- A 2024 CNN analysis found that criminologists have analyzed hundreds of studies on immigration and crime, and the most common finding is that there is no connection between immigration and crime. - Providing legal status and benefits to undocumented Mexican immigrants could result in a significant economic boost in terms of growth, earnings, tax revenues, and jobs.\n- Legal status could increase the effective labour supply of undocumented Mexican immigrants, allowing them to pursue jobs that better suit their skills and improving their productivity.\n- Legal status could encourage undocumented Mexican immigrants to improve their language skills, complete additional education and training, and improve their health outcomes, making them more productive members of society.\n- Legal status could increase tax revenues, as undocumented immigrants would be more likely to comply with tax requirements and contribute higher payroll and income taxes.\n- Legal status could improve the health and well-being of the children of undocumented Mexican immigrants, who often grow up in households below the federal poverty level due to their parents' immigration status.\n- Legal status could reduce wage disparities between documented and undocumented Mexican immigrants, with documented workers earning higher wages and having better working conditions and job security. - A study by Cornell University found that granting citizenship to undocumented immigrants would create jobs and increase tax revenues.\n- A study by the White House Council of Economic Advisers found that providing legal status to undocumented immigrants would increase their effective labour supply, and would likely raise tax revenues, increase productivity, and have additional benefits for the children of these immigrants.\n- A study by the Center for American Progress found that providing a pathway to citizenship for the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US would, over 10 years, boost US GDP by $1.2 trillion.\n- A study by the Penn Wharton Budget Model found that immigration has a net positive effect on combined federal, state, and local budgets.", "counter-argument": "142\tThe American Dream is about providing opportunities for the poorest and most desperate individuals to succeed through hard work, regardless of their origins.

The British did not consider partitioning Kashmir along religious lines in 1947.\n- Instead, the British left the decision of whether to join India or Pakistan to the rulers of princely states, including Kashmir.\n- The ruler of Kashmir, Maharaja Hari Singh, decided to remain independent, as he expected that the state's Muslims would be unhappy with accession to India, and the Hindus and Sikhs would become vulnerable if he joined Pakistan.\n- However, the decision to remain independent was short-lived, as Pakistani tribal militias invaded Kashmir, leading the Hindu ruler of Jammu and Kashmir to join India. - The partition of Kashmir along religious lines could have led to a large-scale migration of people, similar to what happened during the 1947 Partition of India, which saw an estimated 12 to 20 million people displaced along religious lines, and the loss of hundreds of thousands to a million lives.\n- The division of Kashmir could have escalated tensions between India and Pakistan, which could have led to a military conflict between the two nuclear-capable states.\n- The religious partition of Kashmir could have resulted in the marginalization and persecution of minority groups, as seen in the aftermath of the 1947 Partition of India, where religious minorities in some regions were subjected to forced migration, religious conversion, or death.\n- The division of Kashmir may not have resolved the conflict between India and Pakistan over the region, as both countries continued to claim Kashmir in its entirety.\n- The religious partition of Kashmir could have disrupted trade and economic activities, particularly in regions with a history of inter-religious trade, as seen in the case of the jute industry in Bengal, which was disrupted by the partition.\n- The division of Kashmir along religious lines could have led to a change in the demographic composition of the region, with potential consequences for literacy, occupation, and economic activities, as seen in the post-partition demographic changes in Indian and Pakistani districts.\n- The religious partition of Kashmir may not have addressed the aspirations of the Kashmiri people for self-determination and independence, as they may not have favored joining either India or Pakistan. - The Kashmir conflict is a territorial dispute between India and Pakistan, with China also involved in the northeastern region.\n- The conflict arose from the partition of India in 1947, as both India and Pakistan claimed the entirety of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir. \n- The dispute has escalated into three wars and several armed skirmishes between India and Pakistan.\n- The conflict has led to a high level of militarisation in Kashmir, with both countries regularly exchanging fire across the contested border. \n- The conflict has resulted in tens of thousands of casualties, both combatant and civilian. \n- The conflict has also resulted in the exodus of Kashmiri Hindus from the predominantly Muslim Kashmir Valley in the early 1990s. \n- The conflict has fuelled anti-India sentiment in the region, with violent demonstrations and anti-India protests calling for an independent Kashmir. \n- The conflict has led to accusations of human rights abuses by both sides, with Indian forces accused of committing extrajudicial killings, rape, torture, and enforced disappearances. \n- The conflict has also led to accusations of forced disappearances and political repression in Azad Kashmir, the region controlled by Pakistan. \n- The conflict has had a significant impact on regional stability, with both countries possessing nuclear weapons and coming close to nuclear war in 1999. \n- The conflict has also impacted relations between India and Pakistan, with diplomatic ties being downgraded and attempts at peace negotiations failing due to the dispute. \n- The conflict has led to a breakdown in trust between the two countries, with frequent accusations of violating ceasefire agreements and supporting terrorist groups. \n- The conflict has resulted in a lack of cooperation between India and Pakistan on other issues, such as counterterrorism and regional stability. \n- The conflict has also drawn in other countries, such as the United States and China, who have attempted to mediate between the two sides. The Kashmir conflict has been a significant factor in Pakistan's decision to develop nuclear weapons. Pakistan's nuclear weapons program was established in the 1950s, but it was accelerated after the country's defeat in the 1971 war with India, which resulted in the secession of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). Pakistan's nuclear weapons program was also influenced by India's nuclear tests in 1974 and 1998, as well as India's perceived nuclear threat and conventional military superiority.

Potential drawbacks of normalizing relations with Cuba:\n- The Obama administration's \"bailout\" of the Castro regime lost the US any leverages for political reforms that would grant Cuban citizens basic human rights, such as freedom of speech and assembly.\n- The liberalization allowed an influx of \"desperately needed hard currency\" without forcing Cuba to make any \"meaningful political concessions\".\n- Senator Robert Menendez of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee opposed the Obama Administration's decision to reinstate diplomatic relations with Cuba, claiming that it would not address the authoritarian control exercised over the Cuban people.\n- Senator Marco Rubio expressed his disapproval of the thaw in US-Cuban diplomatic relations, accusing the Obama administration of basing the new policy on US economic interests rather than the interests of the Cuban people.\n- The normalization of relations and the resulting economic boost to Cuba may not have been enough to establish a lasting \"new chapter\" in the history of US-Cuba relations.\n\n## How these risks were addressed:\n- The Obama administration expressed its hopes to work with the Cuban government to help confront growing challenges such as climate change, disease, and illicit trafficking.\n- The US and Cuba began collaborating on key areas of mutual interest, such as migration talks, national security issues, counternarcotics, and counterterrorism.\n- The US and Cuba also began discussions on contentious issues such as human rights and property claims.\n- The US loosened travel restrictions, allowing US residents to see Cuba for themselves.\n- The US resumed regular commercial air service, allowing travelers to fly to Cuba on US carriers for the first time in over half a century.\n- The US authorized US cruise ships to port in Cuban harbors.\n\n## Potential drawbacks of reaching a nuclear deal with Iran:\n- The 2015 nuclear deal with Iran was criticized for being null and void as it failed to address the current status of Iran's nuclear program.\n- The ability of Western powers to \"snap back\" crippling nuclear sanctions on Iran under the 2015 nuclear deal will expire in October 2025.\n- This means the US and its European allies would lose much of their economic leverage over Iran.\n\n## How these risks were addressed:\n- The 2015 deal blocked Iran's four pathways to a nuclear weapon.\n- Before the agreement, Iran's breakout time was only two to three months. Thanks to the deal, it would take Iran 12 months or more.\n- The deal put in place unprecedented monitoring and access, so if Iran tries to develop nuclear weapons, sanctions will snap back into place.\n- Iran has committed to extraordinary and robust monitoring, verification, and inspection. \n- International inspectors from the IAEA will continuously monitor every element of Iran's declared nuclear program.", "counter-argument": "146\tObama was a decent president but not excellent, as his actions were not necessarily good for everyone in the country.

{"argument": "True equality can only be achieved by eliminating capitalism and inheritance, as the current system determines one's life based on their birth class.

Some see it as unfair, as it allows people to enjoy high incomes without any effort, creating inequality of opportunity. Others view it as a legitimate way to pass on wealth to future generations and encourage the development of new wealth. \n- It is suggested that a reformed capitalist system that ensures equality of opportunity, through measures such as confiscating the property of the capitalists after their death, could achieve true equality without eliminating capitalism and inheritance entirely. \n- However, it is argued that such intervention would move society towards socialism and away from capitalism. - According to the theory of \"life chances\" in sociology, an individual's opportunities to improve their quality of life are positively correlated with their socioeconomic status. This includes access to resources such as food, clothing, shelter, education, and healthcare. \n- German sociologist Max Weber introduced the term \"life chances\" in the 1920s, building upon some of Karl Marx's ideas about social stratification and social class. Weber's theory states that the higher one's socioeconomic status, the better their life chances. \n- Marxists believe that social class is the primary factor influencing life chances in capitalist societies built on class hierarchies. \n- Birth class can determine access to quality healthcare, education, housing, and other resources that improve quality of life. \n- Under capitalism, the means of production are privately owned, and labor is paid wages without owning the means of production. This creates a class conflict between capital and labor, resulting in wealth disparities and social inequalities. \n- In a capitalist society, individuals' life chances are influenced by their birth class, which affects their access to resources and opportunities for social mobility. - Labour shortages may occur.\n- Wage levels may increase, causing higher costs for firms.\n- Firms may need to absorb higher costs or pass them on to customers.\n- The economy may suffer from inherent instability, and economic growth and other macroeconomic indicators may fluctuate.\n- Inflation may increase.\n- There may be a negative impact on mental health, physical health, and job performance.\n- There may be a negative impact on relationships and personal life. - Kuznets' innovation in relating economics and institutions predicts that in the advanced phase of capitalism, the labor force bargains to improve pay and work conditions, leading to a strengthening of the welfare state and a decrease in inequality.\n- The upswing in inequality in industrialized Western societies in the late 20th century sparked a debate on income and wealth distribution, a central issue in economics and politics.\n- The labour discipline model implies that there must always be involuntary unemployment, where people are willing to work but are unemployed due to factors like extended periods without wage offers. - Equality of outcome is a concept where all individuals have approximately the same material wealth and income. This is in opposition to the concept of meritocracy where the success of individuals is determined by their abilities, regardless of inequalities of outcome. \n- Revolutionary socialists support equality of outcome. Marx and Engels believed in common ownership over the means of production within a communist economy. \n- Social democrats support equality of outcome to a much lesser extent than revolutionary socialists, favouring equality of opportunity instead. \n- Third-way socialists dismiss the concept of equality of outcome altogether.

With enough money, political narratives can be controlled, and election results can be unfairly influenced.\n- Super PACs have shifted the electoral balance of power away from everyday voters towards wealthy donors, reducing the average voter's ability to meaningfully influence elections.\n- The lack of transparency and disclosure in super PAC funding has resulted in a flood of \"dark money,\" making it difficult for voters to know who is spending money to influence elections.\n- Despite federal law prohibiting coordination between super PACs and candidates, illegal coordination is common, and enforcement by the FEC has been lacking. - In the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, Congress imposed new and stringent regulations and limitations on contributions to and expenditures by political campaigns, as well as disclosure requirements. The landmark case of Buckley v. Valeo (1976) upheld the contribution and disclosure sections of the statute but voided the limitations on expenditures.\n- In Citizens United v. FEC (2010), the Court loosened restrictions on corporate political spending, holding that corporate funding of independent political broadcasts in candidate elections cannot be limited under the First Amendment.\n- In Nixon v.

Many fear that seeking help will lead to arrest and stigma.\n- Legalizing prostitution may increase human trafficking.\n\n## How legalizing prostitution might impact the perception of women and their role in society:\n- It can improve the safety of sex workers by bringing the industry out of the black market and imposing strict regulations.\n- It can provide a more positive perception of sex workers, allowing them access to the legal system and encouraging them to report dangerous behaviors.\n- It can provide tax revenue, reduce sexually transmitted diseases, and reallocate law enforcement resources.\n- It can improve the health and safety of sex workers and have positive effects on public health.", "counter-argument": "151\tLegalizing prostitution may fail to protect those outside regulated systems and foster competition with a cheaper illegal market, as seen in Nevada, where most prostitution remains unlicensed.

It is generally pejorative.\n- Demographic bias: where factors such as gender, race, and social and economic status influence reporting and can be a factor in different coverage of various demographic groups.\n- Distortion bias: when the fact or reality is distorted or fabricated in the news.\n- Episodic framing of television: can lead people to ascribe blame to individuals instead of society, in contrast to thematic framing that leads people to look more at societal causes.\n- False balance and false equivalence: occur when an issue is presented as having equally-compelling reasons on both sides, despite disproportionate amounts of evidence favouring one (also known as undue weight).\n- False timeliness: implying that an event is a new event, and thus deriving notability, without addressing past events of the same kind.\n- Gatekeeping bias (also known as selectivity or selection bias): when stories are selected or deselected, sometimes on ideological grounds. It is sometimes also referred to as agenda bias, when the focus is on political actors and whether they are covered based on their preferred policy issues.\n- Mainstream bias: a tendency to report what everyone else is reporting, and to avoid stories that will offend anyone. This type of bias can result in the homogenisation of information, diminishing diversity in media content and negatively impacting both media consumption and the overall user experience.\n- Negativity bias (or bad news bias): a tendency to show negative events and portray politics as less of a debate on policy and more of a zero-sum struggle for power. Excessive criticism or negativity can lead to cynicism and disengagement from politics.\n- Partisan bias: a tendency to report to serve a particular political party leaning.\n- Sensationalism: bias in favour of the exceptional over the ordinary, giving the impression that rare events, such as aeroplane crashes, are more common than common events, such as automobile crashes.\n- Speculative content: when stories focus not on what has occurred, but primarily on what might occur, using words like \"could\", \"might\", or \"what if\", without labelling the article as analysis or opinion.\n- Statement bias (also known as tonality bias or presentation bias): when media coverage is slanted towards or against particular actors or issues.\n- Structural bias: when an actor or issue receives more or less favourable coverage as a result of newsworthiness and media routines, not as the result of ideological decisions (e.g. incumbency bonus).\n- Tuchman's Law: suggests how people overestimate the risk from dangers that are disproportionately discussed in media.\n- Ventriloquism: when experts or witnesses are quoted in a way that intentionally voices the author's own opinion.\n- Spin bias: when journalists put a \"spin\" on a story, they stray from objective, measurable facts. Spin is a form of media bias that clouds a reader's view, preventing them from getting a precise take on what happened.\n- Unsubstantiated claims: journalists sometimes make claims in their reporting without including evidence to back them up.\n- Opinion statements presented as facts: when journalists use subjective language or statements under the guise of reporting objectively.\n- Sensationalism/emotionalism: when information is presented in a way that gives a shock or makes a deep impression.\n- Mudslinging/ad hominem: when unfair or insulting things are said about someone in order to damage their reputation.\n- Mind reading: when a writer assumes they know what another person thinks, or thinks that the way they see the world reflects the way the world really is.\n- Slant: when journalists tell only part of a story, or when they highlight, focus on, or play up one particular angle or piece of information.\n- Flawed logic: when journalists misrepresent people's opinions or arrive at conclusions that are not justified by the given evidence.\n- Bias by omission: when media outlets choose not to cover certain stories, omit information that would support an alternative viewpoint, or omit voices and perspectives on the other side.\n- Omission of source attribution: when a journalist does not back up their claims by linking to the source of that information.\n- Bias by story choice and placement: when a media outlet's bias is revealed by which stories the outlet chooses to cover or to omit.\n- Subjective qualifying adjectives: when journalists include subjective, qualifying adjectives in front of specific words or phrases, suggesting a way for the reader to interpret the issue.\n- Elite vs. populist bias: elite bias is when journalists defer to the beliefs, viewpoints, and perspectives of people who are part of society's most prestigious, credentialed institutions. Populist bias is when the journalist defers to the perspectives, beliefs, or viewpoints of those who are outside of or dissent from prestigious institutions. - Critical thinking is essential for identifying fake news and misinformation. It helps individuals evaluate the credibility of sources and arguments, identify logical fallacies, and make informed judgments.\n- Critical thinking plays a crucial role in media literacy by enabling individuals to analyze and interpret information effectively. It helps them question assumptions, evaluate evidence, and identify biases and agendas.\n- Critical thinking empowers individuals to actively participate in democratic societies by forming their own opinions based on evidence and reasoning. It promotes accountability and responsible media consumption.\n- Critical thinking is important for fact-checking, especially in the era of information overload and the rapid spread of misinformation. It allows individuals to verify information, cross-reference sources, and distinguish credible information from rumors or hoaxes.\n- Critical thinking fosters open-mindedness and encourages individuals to consider multiple perspectives, which is essential for meaningful dialogue and resolving complex issues.\n- Critical thinking helps individuals recognize and evaluate biases in media messages, understand how these biases influence their perception of information, and make logical connections between ideas. I was unable to find any studies on the frequency of valid distractions identified by the general public. However, I found some information on the effects of distractions on memory and cognition, and the effects of technology on academic distraction.\n\n**Effects of Distraction on Memory and Cognition**\n- A 2014 study by Fergus I.M. Craik found that the presence of distracting information captures attention and impairs performance in working memory tasks.\n- A 2014 study by Beaman et al. explored the effects of auditory distraction on the recognition of word pairs and found that distraction had a negative effect on both the straight cognitive aspect of recognition and the metacognitive aspects of how participants managed their decision-making.\n- A 2014 study by Scheiter et al. investigated the effects of interesting but irrelevant information on people working to solve easy or difficult problems. They found that having a pending goal for future tasks increased the relevance of distracting information, which in turn consumed some of the individual's limited attentional resources.\n- A 2014 study by Buchanan et al. found that eye contact with another person was particularly disruptive to performance in a visual working memory task.\n- A 2014 study by Hyman et al. provided dramatic illustrations of how people can avoid obstacles yet remember few details of the objects later.\n\n**Effects of Technology on Academic Distraction**\n- A 2020 study by Alexander J. Dontre found that the use of laptops, smartphones, and social media can be detrimental to learning and academic performance, particularly when students are multitasking.\n- A 2010 study by Kirschner and Karpinski found a negative association between Facebook use and GPA, with Facebook users studying less than non-users.\n- A 2019 study by Alghamdi et al. found that media multitasking was associated with lower self-efficacy, which in turn was associated with a lower GPA in both online and face-to-face classes.\n- A 2018 study by Kates et al. found a small but significant negative effect of media multitasking with smartphones on academic performance.\n- A 2018 study by Rashid and Asghar suggested that smartphone use can be beneficial to self-directed learning, although making phone calls was shown to have a negative effect on academic performance.\n- A 2016 study by Felisoni and Godoi found that every 10 additional minutes of cellphone use is associated with a steady reduction in academic performance.\n- A 2014 study by Ophir et al. demonstrated that heavy media multitaskers are more susceptible to distraction from irrelevant stimuli than light media multitaskers, yet they continue to multitask anyway. - Media outlets can use distraction as a tactic to divert attention from important issues, as seen in the 2020 US presidential election, where foreign actors took advantage of the media's focus to carry out unpopular actions. \n- Media outlets can also be a source of distraction themselves, with the average knowledge worker switching tasks every three minutes, and taking half an hour to resume the original task after being distracted. \n- Media competition is a driving force for media bias, manipulation, and distraction. If a media outlet can find an audience with a united ideology, it can develop a loyal consumer base.", "counter-argument": "162\tThe media is not intentionally trying to distract people with irrelevant details of a case, but rather trying to create a spin to draw in viewers and turn a profit. The goal of the media is to provide entertainment and get views, not to distract people from reality, but this can still have the effect of distracting from the main issue.\n"}
{"argument": "I think that \"financial abortion\" or the concept of allowing men to opt out of paying child support should only be considered if a social safety net is established to support the child.

Furthermore, it fails to address the root causes of gender inequality and the structural barriers that often limit women's options and resources to support their children independently.", "questions": {"question": ["What are the specific rights of children as outlined by the UN?", "How does state-provided welfare for single parents currently work in developed countries?", "What are the potential consequences of allowing men to opt out of paying child support?", "Are there any successful examples of a social safety net being implemented to support children in cases where the father opts out?", "What are the potential challenges and costs associated with the state taking on this responsibility?"]}, "qa_context": "- The right to life, survival and development\n- Protection from violence, abuse or neglect\n- An education that enables children to fulfil their potential\n- Be raised by, or have a relationship with, their parents\n- Express their opinions and be listened to\n- Relax and play\n- Freedom of expression\n- Protection of identity\n- A sufficient standard of living\n- Know their rights\n- Health and health services The welfare state is a form of government in which the state or a well-established network of social institutions protects and promotes the economic and social well-being of its citizens. The welfare state is based on the principles of equal opportunity, equitable distribution of wealth, and public responsibility for citizens unable to avail themselves of the minimal provisions for a good life. \n\nIn developed countries, welfare states vary in form and trajectory. All welfare states entail some degree of private\u2013public partnerships wherein the administration and delivery of at least some welfare programs occur through private entities. Welfare state services are also provided at varying territorial levels of government. \n\nWelfare systems in developed countries generally provide support for time to care and/or encourage gender-egalitarian divisions of labor in paid work and care. Welfare states can affect the distribution of well-being and personal autonomy among their citizens, as well as influencing how their citizens consume and how they spend their time. \n\nIn the US, the welfare state is characterised by private provision because such a state would better reflect the racial and sexual biases within the private sector. The disproportionate number of racial and sexual minorities in private sector jobs with weaker benefits is evidence that the American welfare state is not necessarily intended to improve the economic situation of such groups. \n\nIn the UK, the welfare state is characterised by a belief that engaging in paid work will alleviate the poverty blamed for poor health outcomes in lone parents, and thus has the potential to tackle inequalities in both income and health. \n\nIn Canada, the welfare state is characterised by a belief that working is health-promoting and will benefit both lone parents and their children. \n\nIn Australia, the welfare state is characterised by a belief that welfare reform was a highly politicised and controversial issue. \n\nIn Germany, the welfare state is characterised by a belief that the welfare state established by previous German governments was maintained, but it was restructured so as to help only Aryan individuals considered worthy of assistance, excluding \"alcoholics, tramps, homosexuals, prostitutes, the 'work-shy' or the 'asocial', habitual criminals, the hereditarily ill (a widely defined category) and members of races other than the Aryan\". \n\nIn India, the welfare state is characterised by a belief that food security to all Indians is guaranteed under the National Food Security Act, where the government provides food grains to people at a very subsidised rate. \n\nIn China, the welfare state is characterised by a belief that China traditionally relied on the extended family to provide welfare services. The one-child policy introduced in 1978 has made that unrealistic, and new models have emerged since the 1980s as China has rapidly become richer and more urban. - It could encourage more women to give their children up for adoption or choose to have an abortion, resulting in fewer children being born into single-mother households.\n- It could lead to more children being born into poverty, as the financial burden would fall on the mother or the state.\n- It could result in more men opting out of fatherhood, leaving women to raise children alone.\n- It could be unfair to the child, who has a right to a legal relationship with their father and financial support for their upbringing.\n- It could be considered a form of forced motherhood for women, as they would have fewer options and resources to support their children. - In the US, about 2.7 million children receive Social Security benefits, with more than half of these children receiving benefits after the death of a parent.\n- In the US, 98 out of 100 children can get Social Security if a working parent dies.\n- In the US, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) helps children with qualifying disabilities by providing critical financial assistance.\n- In the US, children and youth with specific medical conditions\u2014whose families meet certain income and resource limits\u2014can receive SSI from birth until age 18.\n- In the US, if a child has a disability before the age of 22 and continues to have a disability, Social Security benefits may be paid to them if their parent retires, begins a period of disability, or dies.\n- In the US, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) disqualifies citizen children in immigrant families if any family member on their tax return does not have a work-authorizing Social Security Number (SSN).\n- In the US, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) reduced the risk of poverty for households headed by DACA-eligible persons by 38%. ## Challenges and Costs of State-Funded Healthcare:\n- **Administrative Costs****:** Administrative costs are a significant factor in the high cost of healthcare in the US. These include costs related to billing, coding, submission, and rework. According to statistics, healthcare costs in the United States exceed those in other developed nations, with administrative costs reaching $1,055 per person in 2021.\n- **Drug Costs****:** Americans pay almost twice as much for prescription drugs compared to citizens of other developed countries. This is due to a lack of price regulation and the ability of private insurers to negotiate drug prices with manufacturers. \n- **Salaries for Medical Professionals****:** Medical professionals in the US earn more than their counterparts in other industrialized countries. For example, the average annual salary for a family doctor in the US was $239,200 in 2023, while emergency room physicians earned an average of $306,640. \n- **Hospital Costs****:** Hospital care accounts for a significant portion of healthcare costs in the US and is expected to increase. Prices for inpatient services in the US are higher compared to other countries. \n- **Defensive Medical Practices****:** The fear of lawsuits leads to unnecessary tests and scans being ordered, which are costly for patients. \n- **Varying Healthcare Prices****:** The lack of set prices for medical services in the US results in varying costs depending on the payer, coverage, and geographical area.", "counter-argument": "163\tIf financial abortion is an option, there will likely be fewer babies in situations where the parents are not financially prepared. People respond to incentives, and the lack of money is a significant incentive, especially since abortion is an option and many babies in these situations are not really unwanted. The current child support system is often unfair to men, and financial abortion could be a more practical solution than forcing men to pay child support they cannot afford.  \n"}

{"argument": "Police brutality is a serious issue, but I think that media coverage has unfairly portrayed law enforcement as a whole, creating a negative image. I believe that the media's scrutiny has exaggerated the severity of police brutality cases, and that the actions of a few \"bad apples\" are being unfairly attributed to all officers. This has led to increased anti-police sentiments, making it difficult for officers who are doing their job without prejudice to do so effectively.\n", "cmdr_websearch": "While it is true that media coverage of police brutality has increased, studies suggest that this is not due to an increase in incidents but rather a result of factors such as the widespread use of smartphones, social media, and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement.

The study found that citizens' opinions of the police were \"positive and stable over time, at least in the absence of significant shifts in police policy or media scandals.\"\n- A study by Cardiff University and the University of St Andrews found that negative portrayals of the police in the media can influence public opinion, particularly among African American college students with personal or familial experiences of police victimization. The study concluded that \"if the media depicts law enforcement positively, such as is often the case with television news and crime-based reality television, increased confidence in law enforcement is likely to result when individuals do not have an arrest record or were not victimized.\" - A study conducted in Florida used a survey of sworn personnel in the State of Florida from agencies with more than 100 sworn personnel to determine the impact of media scrutiny on police officer morale and performance.\n- The Police Executive Research Forum (PERF) conducted a survey of nearly 200 departments, which showed a startling 45% increase in the retirement rate and a 20% increase in resignations in 2020-21 compared to the previous year.

Additionally, the London Debt Accords, which were a pivotal part of Germany's debt restructuring, included debts beyond just those of the German government, encompassing those of German individuals and companies as well.", "questions": {"question": ["What are the key differences between war debts and regular government debts?", "How did Germany's post-WWII debt restructuring differ from Greece's current situation in terms of economic conditions?", "Were there any legal or moral obligations tied to Germany's post-WWII debt that are not present in Greece's case?", "What role did international politics play in Germany's debt restructuring, and is this a factor in Greece's situation?", "How has the European Union's approach to debt management and economic policy changed since WWII?"]}, "qa_context": "- War debts are incurred when a government borrows money to finance military conflicts. Regular government debts, on the other hand, are accrued due to budget deficits, economic crises, or stimulus measures during recessions.\n- War debts often involve a combination of financing methods such as money printing, taxation, selling government debt to the public, and borrowing from other nations. Regular government debts are typically financed through taxation, borrowing, or issuing debt instruments like bonds and bills.\n- War debts can be highly controversial and impact a government's popularity, especially when relying on increased taxation. Regular government debts may also face opposition but are generally less contentious.\n- War debts can have long-term economic consequences, including inflation and reduced purchasing power. Regular government debts can also lead to rising interest rates and impact economic growth if they become excessive.\n- War debts are often repaid over extended periods, with principal and interest payments lasting decades. Regular government debts usually have shorter repayment periods and are addressed through budget surpluses or debt refinancing. - Germany's post-WWII debt restructuring was a result of the country's inability to pay war reparations following World War I (Treaty of Versailles). In contrast, Greece's debt crisis was triggered by the 2007-2008 financial crisis and structural weaknesses in the Greek economy.\n- Germany's debt was largely owed to foreign creditors, while Greece's debt is owed to international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, the Eurogroup, and the European Central Bank.\n- Germany's debt restructuring involved a reduction in the country's debt by half, while Greece's debt relief measures included tax increases, spending cuts, and reforms, as well as bailout loans and debt \"haircuts\".\n- Germany's economic growth was facilitated by the Marshall Plan and the country's strong export performance, while Greece's economic growth was hindered by its membership in the Eurozone, which limited its monetary policy flexibility.\n- Germany's debt restructuring was a one-time event, whereas Greece's debt crisis has persisted for over a decade and has required multiple bailout packages. - In 1953, Germany's post-WWII debt was cut in half. This was due to the London Debt Accords, which were signed by the US, UK, France, Greece, Spain, Pakistan, and others. \n- The London Debt Accords addressed all debts owed by West Germany to people, governments, and companies in other countries. This included debts of German individuals and companies, not just those of the government. \n- The London Debt Accords also included all types of creditors, whether foreign governments or companies. This ensured equal treatment for all, while preventing Germany from being pursued by companies for double the amount of debt it was paying to others. \n- The London Debt Accords set limits on debt payments, agreeing that West Germany's debt payments could only come out of trade surplus. \n- The London Debt Accords allowed for negotiations rather than sanctions.

Germany benefitted from the crisis through falling borrowing rates, investment influx, and exports boost thanks to the depreciation of the Euro. \n- Germany has been accused of hypocrisy in its handling of the Greek debt crisis. Despite calling for Greece to adhere to fiscal responsibility, Germany missed its own cost-cutting targets in 2011.\n- Germany's pursuit of its own national interests has been criticised, with Philip Whyte stating that \"Germany is worried about the fact that other countries are sinking further into debt, [but] should be worried about the size of its trade surpluses\".\n- Germany's banks were Greece's \"enablers\", lending more than they could afford.\n- Germany's arms sales to Greece meant that trade became synonymous with high-level bribery and corruption.\n- Germany's austerity and debt-relief programme conditions attached to Greece's bailouts have been criticised.\n- Germany's unwillingness to adjust its fiscal policy to help resolve the Eurozone crisis has been noted. - The European Union's approach to debt management and economic policy has changed since WWII by focusing on large-scale borrowing and debt issuance.\n- The EU has issued debt on behalf of the European Union, but the scale and nature of this borrowing has changed drastically since the COVID-19 crisis. \n- The EU increased its borrowing massively to create two new instruments in response to the COVID-19 crisis: Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency (SURE) and NextGenerationEU (NGEU). \n- The EU cannot affect the overall cyclical movement of interest rates and will have to learn to live with it, like sovereigns do.\n- The EU should continue to try to narrow the spread with major European sovereigns by further developing the relevant market infrastructure and improving its issuance strategy.\n- The EU will borrow a total of \u20ac421.1 billion, in current prices, for \u2018non-repayable support\u2019 (i.e. for RRF grants and additional funding for existing EU programmes under the EU budget).\n- The EU should quickly review how interest costs are accounted for in its budget and financial framework.\n- The EU as an issuer is currently trapped between SSA and sovereign status.\n- The question of the overall cost distribution among Member States is then crucial in order to identify the desirable benefits that can be drawn by an optimal setup of the Debt Agency\u2019s.", "counter-argument": "180\tThe difficulty of discussing complex topics in simple language and appreciates the challenge of conveying ideas without using technical jargon is aknowledged.

It is a form of liberalism, classical liberalism in particular, the political philosophy associated with the English philosophers John Locke and John Stuart Mill, the Scottish economist Adam Smith, and the American statesman Thomas Jefferson. Liberalism seeks to define and justify the legitimate powers of government in terms of certain natural or God-given individual rights. These rights include the rights to life, liberty, private property, freedom of speech and association, freedom of worship, government by consent, equality under the law, and moral autonomy (the ability to pursue one\u2019s own conception of happiness, or the \u201cgood life\u201d). The purpose of government, according to liberals, is to protect these and other individual rights, and in general liberals have contended that government power should be limited to that which is necessary to accomplish this task. Libertarians are classical liberals who strongly emphasise the individual right to liberty. They contend that the scope and powers of government should be constrained so as to allow each individual as much freedom of action as is consistent with a like freedom for everyone else. Thus, they believe that individuals should be free to behave and to dispose of their property as they see fit, provided that their actions do not infringe on the equal freedom of others. - Lack of transparency in AI decision-making can lead to unintended consequences. For example, an algorithm was used to decide which 60 contract workers would lose their jobs at Meta, but it is unclear what data was used to make those decisions.\n- Allowing AI to be the default decision-maker can have unintended consequences. For example, the more people rely on GPS, the more it erodes their internal navigation capabilities.\n- Software updates can have unintended consequences, such as inadvertently causing a different feature to malfunction or introducing new bugs.\n- Compatibility issues can arise when software is designed to work with different operating systems, hardware configurations, or third-party applications.\n- Security patches can inadvertently introduce new vulnerabilities.\n- User experience changes can have unintended consequences on user experience, such as simplifying a feature and inadvertently making it harder for some users to find or use it effectively.\n- Algorithmic bias can occur when software relies on algorithms and biased training data. For example, a facial recognition system may struggle to accurately identify individuals from certain ethnic backgrounds. - According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, libertarianism is a family of views in political philosophy. Libertarians take individual freedom as the paramount political value and understand coercion to be the antithesis of that freedom. While people can justifiably be forced to do certain things, they cannot be coerced to serve the good of other members of society, nor even their own personal good.\n- Libertarianism has been criticised for presupposing an unrealistic and undesirable conception of individual identity and of the conditions necessary for human flourishing.\n- Libertarianism has also been criticised for promoting \"atomistic\" individualism that ignores the role of family, religious community, and state.\n- Libertarianism has been criticised for having no explicit theory of liberty.\n- Libertarianism has been criticised for promoting laissez-faire capitalism, which does not necessarily produce the best or most efficient outcome, and does not prevent the abuse of natural resources. - Emotional Intelligence (EI) is a vital skill in governance, enhancing leadership, communication, conflict resolution, team building, public relations, stress management, policy formulation, crisis management, and ethical decision-making.\n- EI helps administrators understand and manage their emotions and the emotions of those around them, which is essential for effective leadership and decision-making.\n- EI is crucial for civil servants to handle people-related issues and empathize with different sections of society while making bold decisions and policies that serve the public interest.\n- EI contributes to stable and grounded leadership, with traits such as self-regard, work-life balance, collaboration, and composure under pressure.\n- EI is essential for building trust with citizens and developing relationships, a key aspect of governance.

This is also referred to as the \"is-ought problem\", the \"naturalistic fallacy\", or the \"appeal to nature\". \n- Critics have pointed to the lack of agreement between proponents of natural rights as evidence that the idea is merely a political tool. - In the 1800s, the Second Amendment was interpreted as not granting individuals the right to own a gun.\n- In the 1900s, the Supreme Court ruled that the Second Amendment did not protect weapon types that did not have a \"reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well-regulated militia\".\n- In 2008, the Supreme Court ruled that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to keep a gun for self-defence.\n- In 2010, the Supreme Court ruled that state and local governments are limited to the same extent as the federal government from infringing upon this right.\n- In 2016, the Supreme Court reiterated its earlier rulings that \"the Second Amendment extends, prima facie, to all instruments that constitute bearable arms\".\n- In 2022, the Supreme Court ruled that the right to carry weapons in public spaces is assured with reasonable exceptions.", "counter-argument": "210\tHaving the right to defend oneself is a natural right, and guns are the most effective means of self-defense, making them a necessary tool for equalizing disparities in physical strength and ability.

PR systems can be categorised into party-list PR, mixed-member PR (MMP), and the single transferable vote (STV).\n- PR systems can improve the representation of different demographic groups by ensuring that each representative in an assembly is elected by a roughly equal number of voters. This can help to prevent situations where a party with a minority of votes ends up with a majority of seats.\n- PR systems can also reduce the impact of gerrymandering, as larger districts with multiple members are less prone to manipulation.\n- The use of PR systems can lead to coalition governments, which may be seen as a disadvantage by some. However, supporters of PR argue that coalitions encourage compromise and stability.\n- The allocation of seats in PR systems can be done through various methods, such as the largest remainder method or highest averages methods (e.g., the d'Hondt method and the Sainte-Lagu\u00eb method). - Article I, Section 2, Clause 3 of the US Constitution, also known as the Enumeration Clause or Census Clause, states that \"Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers\".\n- The Fourteenth Amendment, Section 2, replaced the part of the above clause relating to the mode of apportionment of representatives among the states.\n- The Sixteenth Amendment replaced the language regarding taxes on incomes without apportionment, allowing for a federal income tax.\n- The Thirteenth Amendment, ratified on December 6, 1865, abolished slavery.\n- The Constitution guarantees each state at least one member in the House of Representatives.\n- The Reapportionment Act of 1929 capped the number of seats in the House of Representatives at 435.\n- The Huntington-Hill method of equal proportions has been used to distribute seats among the states since the 1940 census reapportionment.\n- The Constitution mandates that seats in the House of Representatives are distributed among the 50 states according to the most recent decennial census.", "counter-argument": "215\t16 and 17-year-olds may be able to argue their positions to local representatives, especially since they will soon be eligible to vote. The drinking age has not been lowered in any state due to federal highway funds being tied to the drinking age being 21, and a massive shift in Congress would be needed to change this. Politicians are able to represent all their constituents, including those under 18, and counting only eligible voters would not be worth the effort due to the quickly changing demographics.\n"}
{"argument": "A person with a minority background can be racist if they hold prejudiced views and act on them, regardless of the target group. The definition of racist behavior should be based solely on whether someone is treating others worse because of their race or ethnicity, without considering power dynamics or historical oppression. \n", "cmdr_websearch": "By ignoring power dynamics and historical context, this argument fails to recognize the systemic nature of racism and the role of privilege and oppression. Racism is not solely about individual prejudice and behavior; it involves the unequal distribution of power and the deliberate structuring of privilege, which are influenced by historical oppression and result in institutional discrimination. Failing to address these factors perpetuates a false narrative that ignores the root causes of racism and hinders efforts to create meaningful change and achieve racial equity.", "questions": {"question": ["Can a person from a minority group be racist?", "What is the role of power dynamics in defining racist behavior?", "How does historical oppression influence the definition of racism?", "Are prejudiced views and actions alone sufficient to define racism?", "What are the potential consequences of ignoring power dynamics and historical context when addressing racist behavior?"]}, "qa_context": "- An article in Medium argues that people from minority groups can be racist, but that it is usually not as bad as racism from the majority group.\n- Wikipedia notes that while individual members of minority groups in the US may hold racist beliefs towards white people, they generally lack the power to damage the interests of whites, who remain the dominant group.\n- An article in United Way NCA notes that interpersonal racism is the expression of racism on an individual level, primarily through interactions between individuals.\n- An article in National Association of Scholars notes that the idea that \"black people can't be racist\" is a meme, not a coherent argument. - Racism is an act of dominance that arises from asymmetrical power dynamics, where the perpetrator occupies a more powerful or dominant position than the victim.\n- Power dynamics result from an imbalance in access to resources, with those possessing greater economic and social capital holding more power and influence.\n- Privilege, often associated with racial, social, educational, and economic status, grants advantages to certain individuals or groups, exempting them from liability or providing benefits unavailable to others.\n- Prejudice, which forms the basis of racism, is influenced by power dynamics. It is a refusal to change one's attitude or behavior, even in the face of contrary evidence, driven by the fear of losing power and privilege.\n- Racism is a deliberate structuring of privilege through objective, differential, and unequal treatment of people, resulting in an ideology of supremacy that justifies power over others.\n- Institutional racism, the most pervasive form, involves the conscious manipulation of societal institutions to discriminate against people of color through practices, policies, and power arrangements. - Historical oppression influences the definition of racism by shaping societal attitudes and beliefs about race.\n- Historical oppression, such as slavery, segregation, and discriminatory laws, has contributed to the development and reinforcement of racist ideologies and stereotypes.\n- This includes the notion of racial hierarchy, with certain races considered inferior or superior to others.\n- Historical oppression has led to the marginalization and exclusion of certain racial groups, resulting in systemic racism and institutional discrimination.\n- Historical oppression has also influenced the scientific understanding of race, with early scientists subscribing to racist beliefs and contributing to the development of racist theories.\n- Additionally, historical oppression has had a lasting impact on the social and economic opportunities available to different racial groups. - Prejudice is a preconceived idea about a particular group, while racism involves an unequal distribution of power based on race.\n- Racism is a form of prejudice that generally includes negative emotional reactions to members of a group, acceptance of negative stereotypes, and racial discrimination against individuals.\n- Discrimination refers to the differential treatment of different age, gender, racial, ethnic, religious, national, ability identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic, and other groups at the individual level and the institutional/structural level.\n- While prejudice is based in beliefs outside of experience, experience can lead people to feel that their prejudice is confirmed or justified.\n- Prejudice is not instinctive but is most often taught and learned.\n- Prejudice includes all three components of an attitude (affective, behavioral, and cognitive), whereas discrimination involves behavior.\n- A prejudiced person may not act on their attitude. Therefore, someone can be prejudiced toward a certain group but not discriminate against them. The consequences of ignoring power dynamics and historical context when addressing racist behavior are:\n- The persistence of systemic racism.\n- The inability to dismantle the false racial hierarchy.\n- The reinforcement of stereotypes.\n- The inability to recognize the role of power in all types of inequity.\n- The inability to recognize the role of power in racist action.\n- The inability to recognize the role of power in racist action as a form of oppression.\n- The inability to recognize the role of power in racist action as a form of privilege.\n- The inability to recognize the role of power in racist action as a form of discrimination.\n- The inability to recognize the role of power in racist action as a form of racialization.\n- The inability to recognize the role of power in racist action as a form of racial inequality.\n- The inability to recognize the role of power in racist action as a form of racial injustice.", "counter-argument": "216\tThe disagreement around the term \"racism\" stems from differing definitions, with some using it to describe prejudice and others using it to describe prejudice combined with power. If people who use \"racism\" to mean prejudice were to use \"prejudice\" instead, and those who use it to mean prejudice plus power were to use a new term, the issue would be resolved. Treating someone better because of their race is also considered racist, and racism is defined as believing that individual behavior and moral character is predetermined by racial genetics.\n"}
