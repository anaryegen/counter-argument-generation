Kid’s Entertainment by Age Group

Themes / Party ideas

It can be hard for parents to evaluate which activities, or entertainers, young children will enjoy the most. It’s hard enough just trying to keep up with the trends! Your kids will likely suggest multiple activities, but which ones are appropriate? At what age will they enjoy the entertainment to the fullest?

In this article, we’ve sorted party activities and entertainment by age group. However, every child is different and what we’ve listed below is just a rule of thumb.

Entertainment For Ages 3 and Under (Babies and Toddlers)

Entertainment at this age is very much about seeing the world through the eyes of the little ones. It’s not about big extravagant entertainment but about the simpler things. We would avoid more traditional forms of entertainment and opt for more fluid options that little ones can interact with in a number of different ways.

For babies and toddlers, play is all about exploration and using their senses to understand the world. A great sensory party is easy to set up. Create a few different sensory stations or areas that toddlers can explore at their leisure. Here are some ideas:

Playdough (if working with very young children a form of edible playdough is recommended)

Water Play (this can be as simple as a tub of water with some bath toys, or you can create a themed waterplay area with nautical touches)

Food play – cooked spaghetti can be coloured to make a great messy play activity for babies and toddlers

Toddlers are enchanted by the magic of bubbles! Set up a dedicated bubble station where little ones can immerse themselves in the whimsical world of bubbles. A bubble machine can create a continuous stream of bubbles, captivating toddlers as they twirl and dance in the shimmering spheres.

Story Themed Entertainment and Activities

Young children love a good story and using your child’s favourite story as a basis for their birthday is a great way to bring their party to life! Here’s a great example of bringing a story to life through play that would work great as part of a bear-themed party: We’re going on a bear hunt Tuff Tray.

Balloon modellers are magical for younger kids. Just beware, the balloon will eventually pop or go missing (and kids of this age tend not to have much fear when it comes to sitting on or attempting to get their teeth into said balloons!!

If you do want some sort of entertainment ‘show’ then we recommend something like a puppet show with a very simple storyline, – slapstick comedy can work well at this age. Colourful puppets will captivate a group of toddlers and if even better if they can have their own puppet to join in the fun with!

Entertainment For Ages 3–7:

Children’s love of stories continues into this age group too. They enjoy telling them, listening to them and acting them out. Once they hit ages 5 and 6 they also don’t tire out as fast! This means you can now include outdoor activities or active games in your parties – any idea that will help them let off steam! (They’re also just a whole lot more excitable at this age!)

Clowning is a universal form of entertainment and has no age restrictions. Clowns always light up the party with laughter, just be aware of the kids you will be having at your party in case anyone is really afraid of clowns. Younger children may be frightened of face paint. Speak with the performers beforehand to see if they will be wearing make-up

Magic endlessly fascinates young kids. This is the perfect age group to enjoy a kid’s magic show. For an extra touch of magic, consider incorporating themed props or costumes to complement the performance. Whether it’s a wizard hat or a sparkling wand, these enchanting accessories will further immerse the children in the enchanting world of magic.

Face painters are a fantastic addition to any event, especially for children over the age of 3. However, it’s essential to ensure the safety and comfort of the children by checking with the entertainer about the type of paint they use. Invite a skilled face painter to the party to create magical designs that spark joy and imagination.

Now that the children are a little older, they will be able to engage in more elaborate puppet stories. It’s the ideal age to reintroduce them to timeless classics and enchanting tales brought to life through puppetry. Create a cosy space for children to sit, scatter cushions and bean bags can make this a more fun and unique experience for them (we want to avoid school assembly vibes!)

Up to the age of 8 or 9, depending on the venue, play centres can be a great option. Take a look at this article to choose the best entertainment centre for your kids. Be clear on your invitations if older or younger siblings are invited so you don’t leave parents guessing on this (especially if you’d rather stick to one age group)

If your little one is in love with all things princess, then this can be the perfect theme for their party! Have a princess come to the party and transform the guests into their favourite princesses. It’s an unforgettable experience for kids of a young age and is an easy theme to work with. Check out our Princess Party Blog here for more tips and ideas.

Entertainment For Ages 8–12:

At this age, children really start to actively engage in activities. This makes it easier for parents and older siblings to also join in the fun, and make it a memorable experience for all.

Sleepovers and Slumber Parties

The ideal age for sleepovers will differ from child to child. Some will be willing to do a sleepover a lot younger while others are not yet comfortable sleeping away from home (it also depends on your preference as a parent, and what you feel comfortable with). You can even hire someone to do the set-up for you with teepees!

Children love feeling grown up and pamper parties provide just that! You could set up DIY facial stations with face masks, cucumber slices, and other age-appropriate skin care. Manicures usually go down well with a variety of nail polish colours and added gems or stickers depending on the age of the children. You could even provide spa robes and slippers for added relaxation, for a true ‘grown-up’ experience!

For children aged 8 and above, a family magic show offers entertainment suitable for mixed-age groups. Unlike traditional kids’ magic shows, family magic shows appeal to older children and adults alike, making them an ideal choice for inclusive gatherings.

This is the perfect age range for engaging in more hands-on activities. Explore exciting options like cooking workshops, arts and crafts sessions, or even hire a mad science entertainer! These activities foster creativity and curiosity, providing memorable entertainment for children in this age range.

Consider a trip to the cinema for entertainment suitable for this age group. Opt for animated action movies that aren’t overly scary or violent. While superhero films are popular, ensure they’re age-appropriate and not too intense for the audience.

Entertainment Centre

Activities such as bowling, laser tag, indoor football or arcade games are ideal at this age. Again this is also a great option for mixed ages or for parents to participate by mixing up the teams.

Over the age of 8, eating at a restaurant is always a special event. It’s the perfect occasion to go discover fun and trendy restaurants in your area. When making the booking, make sure it’s kid-friendly. The restaurant doesn’t have to be fancy, it just needs to feel special. Make it extra special by ringing ahead to see if the restaurant will play ‘Happy Birthday’ when they bring out the cake, or allow you to have balloons or decorations at your table.

Entertainment For Age 12+:

In the United Kingdom and Ireland, children will enter secondary school around the age of 12. The tastes for entertainment and activities will change accordingly.

Gaming parties are becoming super popular, with the opportunity for kids to play video games with their friends in person. Some venues specialise in this kind of party, or you can hire a van to come to your house, equipped with everything you need to throw an awesome gaming party!

Once kids develop an interest in dancing, they never grow out of it. As is the case with sleepovers, kids will start to enjoy dancing at different ages. It’s also worth including a few games throughout the party to engage everyone.

Sports are great options at this age. If your child is into football, you really can’t go wrong with a football party! For a special event, don’t be afraid to consider something different! For example, you could go rock climbing, kayaking or zip lining for the day – just be sure to check with parents beforehand as some activities will require them to sign a safety waiver or similar.

Another increasingly popular activity for children and adults alike, escape rooms. Why not consider hosting a trip to an escape room for your child and a few friends? You can simply round off the trip with some takeout food making it a super easy option for what can be a difficult age to plan for!

Final thoughts on Age-Appropriate Entertainment for Kids

This isn’t an exhaustive list of activities but rather a good starting place. Once again, as mentioned in the introduction, these age groups are a rule of thumb and each child will be different so get them involved in the decision-making process. Choose your activities accordingly.

If you have a mixed age group, consider family entertainers or family activities. While these options are less targeted, they will appeal to everyone from the younger kids to the adults.
