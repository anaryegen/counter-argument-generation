How Does Religion Provide A "Sense Of Community"? What Does This Mean?

I have often heard people say that religion/faith provides a sense of community, cohesion and can give you friends and stuff. Can someone please explain how religion/faith can do this?

People who have similar values and beliefs tend to form support communities around them. But it's not the religion that provides the community; it's the church. Some people don't make a distinction between those two things.

Thanks for explaining.

One common way to understand religion is through the framework of "the three B's": belief, behavior, and belonging. Pretty much all religions encompass these three aspects (ideas, practices, and community), though different religions tend to emphasize different aspects and connect them in different ways. By coming together around shared practices and ideas, a group of people become a community. Religions typically entail beliefs and behaviors which are of the utmost importance, which thereby cements a strong sense of community because such belongingness is thus also of utmost importance. In other words, because religious communities revolve around the sacred, their sense of belonging is of sacred value.

Thanks for explaining! I appreciate it so much!

Mordecai Kaplan {"Belonging, behaving, believing" -- in that order) for the win!

Just like anything it provides something people can come together and bond over or share experience in. It's imo one of the few good things that religion can produce. Though its in no way exclusive to religion of course.

How does it provide a way for people to come together exactly?

in Christianity, you have the churches which people attend, in Islam you have 5 daily prayers, so people gather together at the mosque, in Judaism you have synagogues where people meet.

these all create the "sense of community" we are talking about, when numerous people with the same religion gather and do religious activies such as praying together, or listening to a sermon...

Thanks so much for explaining! So it basically means worship buildings?

yeah most religions I know have places of worship where people gather. (maybe except some of the polytheistic ones, which don't have temples anymore)

Again, its just something to share with others. I'm a big pro wrestling fan for example. When a wrestling show is on it brings me together with other wrestling fans. No different than religions do.

How do religions bring you together with others?

Are you asking me personally? Because it doesn't. I was just explaining how it does for other people.

Church, is for community. This is where people should come together and share their stories.

Their struggles. Where others who share issues, can share notes. Ideas with one another.

But your teachers are more concerned with your money. Not your problems.

Going to church and just listening to a service. Doesn't bring anyone together.

And that's to bad. But that's the world.

And meeting others who really are, what they should be. I haven't yet.

They all still live, trying to please this world. And not, "The Father".

Western religions have communal worship. Everyone who can be bothered goes to a religious building and worships together at a customary time on a prescribed day of the week. They also often set up other activities. So it's no surprise that members of the same "club" have a sense of community.

Thanks for explaining. As someone whoâ€™s not in a Western religion, this is very interesting!

Humans want to be seen, heard, felt and sensed by others from birth. Those who don't tend to die if their parents aren't paying attention.

And in the echo chambers of religious Groupthink, Social Proof, Implicit Social Contract, Confirmation Bias & Unquestioning Acceptance of Authority, that same imperative can become as addictive as it is all too often abusive.

Thanks for explaining

The term "community" refers to those who practise or agree with the same faith as you. It's similar to a Christian receiving a sense of fellowship after performing a nice deed or praying. Or a Christian attending church and meeting other Christians.

Religion may also be used to attract others. If they have many of the same ideas as you, you'll know you're not alone. You get a sense of community.

To fear God is to fear being disobedient and disloyal to him just as a child might fear disappointing their parents likewise this same fear adjusts a person of faiths conscience to live in a way that is in haromony with God's ways and standards so as long as we fear God as the awe inspiring almighty creator of the heavens and the earth we show that our hearts are not divided toward our creator and that we want to please him why? because loyalty comes from the heart and when we make the choice on our own to fear him we are displaying a willingness out of love to want to live in harmony with our heavenly Father and those that he loves those whose hearts are divided disrupt this harmony and may damage their personal relationship with their creator or cause others to stumble in their faith this is why it is important not to always be indecisive God's word found in the bible gives us enough information to know who God is what he approves of and what he disapproves of we need only to take a side and to make the choice on our own as to whom we shall serve.
