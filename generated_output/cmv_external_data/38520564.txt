4 Reasons Historical and Cultural Context in the Bible Matters

There’s a great quote by Grace Hopper that says, “The most damaging phrase in the language is: ‘it’s always been done that way.’” Grace Hopper is a trailblazer in the computer industry and was also influential in the U.S. Navy. The context of this quote may have been something to do with computer innovations or her career in the U.S. Navy, but her quote can apply to various aspects of life.

It’s damaging to say “it’s always been done that way” because it limits our understanding, and even our faith, to a confined belief system where there’s no room for growth. 

For example, with the Bible. It can be damaging to say “it’s always been done that way” when it comes to reading and studying the Bible in a certain fashion. It can be detrimental to believe certain perspectives, teachings, and spiritual principles simply because “it’s always been done (taught, preached, enforced) that way.” I’m not talking about what the Bible, God’s Word, and the Gospel itself is and says, but more so the messages and teachings which are often delivered out of context. 

Studying historical and cultural context in the Bible helps us step outside of the phrase and even outside of our faith’s comfort zone. We often hold on to certain beliefs because they’re familiar, comfortable, and safe. But when we dig a little deeper and study different angles, we chisel away any false beliefs that may have “rusted” onto the solid rock of the Gospel. 

There are countless Bible stories, verses, and chapters which I look at differently now than I did even five years ago. The message of the gospel never changed, GOD never changes, but my understanding, growth, and knowledge of Him and His word definitely has. 

So, why does historical and cultural context in the Bible even matter? In this post, I’ll share four reasons why it matters, along with some of my favorite resources to help get you started. By the end of this post, I hope this insight encourages and inspires you to continue reading and studying so that your relationship with God deepens and your faith in Him grows.

Reason 1: it helps us understand the WHY behind the WHAT.

The first reason historical and cultural context in the Bible matters is that it helps us understand the WHY behind the WHAT. 

We often leave this part up to theologians, pastors, Bible teachers, and other big-name with-a-title people. Which isn’t bad, but there can be moments when what they say doesn’t actually line up with the truth. Paul said to the Philippians in Philippians 1:18 (AMP). He said, What then [does it matter]? So long as in every way, whether in pretense [for self-promotion] or in all honesty [to spread the truth], Christ is being preached; and in this I rejoice. Yes, and I will rejoice.

In writing this, Paul communicated to the Philippian church that as long as the content of the gospel didn’t change, he didn’t care what motives they had because that’s between them and God. But if the content of the gospel changed at all, it didn’t matter if they had the best motives and intentions. Good motives and intentions cannot excuse false messages (Galatians 1:6-9). 

At the least, it is our responsibility to know what the Word of God says. Even if we don’t know the history or cultural context of certain passages, we can still know God’s Word for ourselves, and study it, trusting that the Holy Spirit will lead us into all truth (John 14:16). But when we take a small step forward and look into the context of scripture, we understand the why behind what is being said. This always strengthens our faith, even if it gets shaken up for a little. 

Reason 2: we can see how the entire Bible connects

The second reason is that historical and cultural context helps us see how the entire Bible connects. 

Along with its many cross references, context helps us understand how the entire Bible connects as a whole. By looking into historical accounts, we can see what else was going on in the world parallel to the Bible’s accounts. We get a better understanding of how certain religions and practices formed, especially why they go against the Bible and its God. Then, cultural context helps us understand the connections between the Old and New Testaments and how the entire Old Testament supports the New Testament and vice versa. Cultural context reveals why certain things were written to various people groups and also how messages got passed down or mistranslated over time.

For example, when reading through Hebrews, the historical and cultural contexts help us see why Jesus was born as a Jew. Jesus had to be made exactly like those to be rescued from death so that he would fully know and emphasize with our experience, be able to be fully merciful and faithful, making an atonement for the sins of the people as our high priest (an Old Testament reference). 

If Jesus could live as a Jew according to the Torah committing no sin, so that he would’ve had earned the death penalty, then he would deliver Jews from death. And if Jews can be saved because Jesus lived as a Jew, then everyone else can be saved. He had to be a Jew because Jews (Hebrews, seeds of Abraham) had the most intense/stringent conditions to fulfill in order to not sin and by not sinning escape death. It’s exactly because Jesus “poured out his soul to death and was numbered with transgressors” that he “bore the sin of many and will make intercession for the transgressors (us).” Gentiles didn’t live as devotedly as the Jews, which is why Jesus’ blood covers them completely, too.

Reason 3: it’s our way of reading between the lines

The third reason is because historical and cultural context is our way of reading between the lines.

The Bible is the book of the “mosts.” It is the most popular, most stolen, studied, gifted, burned, referenced, researched, loved and hated, and most (you fill in the blank). Not only does it inspire and inform, but it literally transforms those who read and apply it to their lives. Hebrews 4:12 says it’s alive and powerful. Which means it applies to us yesterday, today, and tomorrow. It is relevant, helpful, and beneficial.

The Bible is also one of the most contradicted books in the world. Not only does it have contradicting verses, but many use it to justify certain beliefs and behaviors. If someone looks to find contradictions in the Bible, they will certainly find it. But the point isn’t in the contradictions anymore, it’s lack of understanding and lack of willingness to understand. When we study historical and cultural context, we can make sense of any contradictions because we peered into what’s behind the curtain and read between the lines. 

For example, on the surface, the Old Testament books and stories can be gruesome and cumbersome. The New Testament books can seem redundant and inconsistent. But when we look into some context, suddenly, we read between the lines and make sense of what is being said. We can connect the dots and strengthen the stories and their meanings. We can understand which parts apply to our current season of life and stand firm for what we believe.

Reason 4: it teaches us how to read the Bible as a whole

The fourth and final reason is that historical and cultural context teaches us how to read the Bible as a whole. 

The Bible wasn’t written TO you, but FOR you. This is why we have chapters and verses to help us find scripture more quickly. The chapter and verse separations were added to the Bible merely for the sake of convenience. According to the Blue Letter Bible, there is no authoritative basis for the divisions we now find. For the greater part of human history, there have been no chapter or verse divisions in Scripture.

When we study historical and cultural context, we learn how to read the Bible as a whole and not just cherry-pick verses. At this point in my walk with God, I don’t believe cherry-picking is necessarily wrong, but it could be if it alters the message of the gospel and deters us from truth. When we understand even a little of the Bible’s history and cultural references, we can confidently read the Bible as a whole without skipping, avoiding, and ignoring the parts we may not like or enjoy. 

I hope this encourages you to look into historical and cultural context as you read through the Bible. You don’t have to spend a lot of time on the research alone because it can be overwhelming and time-consuming. There are many resources available nowadays that can help you dive just a little deeper to expand your knowledge and understanding of the Word. Here are a few of my favorites that are less than $50:

Blue Letter Bible (I recommend the Enduring Word Commentary!)

The NLT Illustrative Study Bible

The Jewish New Testament Commentary

Mary Magdalene Never Wore Blue Eyeshadow book by Amanda Hope Haley

The Hebrew-Greek Keyword Study Bible

The Greek-English Interlinear New Testament

And of course, look at the cross-references in your current Bible. 

If you are new to faith and you feel overwhelmed about studying the Bible more deeply, I want to encourage you that you don’t have to do it. Pause, pray, and pay attention to how God is leading you to read the Word. There is no right or wrong in the way you read and study. But as time goes on, I also encourage you to take a step into the deeper end. Not to appear more spiritual or knowledgeable, but for your own understanding of the God of the Bible and the four reasons mentioned here.
