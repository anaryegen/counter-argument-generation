Senate tax bill: Lower rates for corporations? Check. Broadening the tax base? Not so much.

The way true tax reform contributes to economic growth and improves economic efficiency is by broadening the tax base—eliminating tax preferences, credits, or deductions—and using the resulting revenue to reduce tax rates on new, more productive activities. Lowering the rates and broadening the base is a mantra of today’s would-be tax reformers.

So how far does the Senate tax bill go in this direction? The short answer: Not very far

By the U.S. Treasury’s estimates, the current tax code contains $380 billion a year in business-related “tax expenditures,” provisions popularly known as deductions, credits, and loopholes.1 Despite all the talk of cleaning up the tax code, the Senate bill actually expands these provisions, on net, reducing revenues by about $9 billion per year, and adds several new expenditures including for alcohol producers and employers providing family and medical leave.

To be sure, the bill broadens the tax base in other ways by targeting deductions or accounting provisions that are not tax expenditures according to the Treasury or the Joint Committee on Taxation. The most significant of these provisions is the limitation on the deductibility of interest—a change that is well-justified on economic grounds.2 But a large share of the revenue-raising business provisions are effectively new taxes, like the effective rate increases on executive compensation. Some new taxes like the one on profit-shifting by foreign-owned businesses, fix specific problems. But not others: new limits on the use of business losses deny tax deductions that should be allowed under an income tax, imposing higher taxes on entrepreneurial activity and exacerbating economic risks for cyclical businesses. That is not the sort of “base-broadening” that the economy needs.

All told, over the next decade, the new business tax system will raise only $363.4 billion by broadening the business tax base. Simultaneously, cuts to corporate and pass-through business tax rates will cost $1.8 trillion. The remainder is financed by a combination of increases in the deficit, increases in taxes on individuals, and a one-time tax on the historical earnings of U.S. multinationals.3

Tackling tax expenditures more aggressively would increase the growth-enhancing benefits of the reform and reduce its unwelcome deficit-widening cost. Indeed, the failure to tackle tax expenditures—lowering rates without broadening the base—is an underlying reason for the Joint Committee on Taxation’s dismal appraisal of the bill’s effect on economic growth. Congress should seize the opportunity to take on special interests and inefficient expenditures while they have the chance.

Measuring Business-Related Tax Expenditures

We compared the revenue provisions included in the Business Tax Reform and International Tax Reform sections of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, as estimated by the JCT, to those elements of Treasury’s tax expenditure budget that benefit corporations and other businesses.4Table 1 shows the direct effect of the legislation on established tax expenditures. It categorizes expenditures based on whether they are expanded, reduced, repealed entirely, or left unchanged in the Senate’s version of the tax bill.

Several of the largest tax expenditures are expanded. These include the treatment of foreign source income of multinational firms, provisions providing favorable accounting treatment to investments at smaller firms, and for the expensing of certain investments.5 Expansions of these tax expenditures reduce revenues by $304 billion over ten years.

Many other provisions are unchanged, including myriad credits for the energy sector, the credit for increasing research activities, and benefits for housing (like the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit), health (like a deduction for Blue Cross Blue Shield), and training, education, and employment (like incentives for hiring members of disadvantaged groups). These provisions represent about 13 percent of the tax expenditure budget.

A number of tax expenditures are curtailed or eliminated entirely. These provisions represent 36 percent of the tax expenditure budget ($1.4 trillion). Examples include the deferral of gains from like-kind exchanges, changes to the tax credit for orphan drug research and the expensing of research and experimentation expenditures. In all, these modifications are scaled back by almost 30 percent, raising $217 billion throughout the budget window.6

Finally, the Senate bill creates several new tax expenditures. The largest is a new (but temporary) credit for employers to provide family and medical leave, which reduces revenues by $4.3 billion over the budget window (but $1.5 billion in 2019 before expiring). In addition, the bill provides for deep cuts in excise tax rates for certain alcohol producers, reducing alcohol excise tax revenues by $1.5 billion in 2019 (or about 16 percent).

On net, expansions of traditional tax expenditures reduce revenues by $87 billion over 10 years while new tax expenditures reduce revenues by an additional $12 billion. Hence, the Senate’s tax reform bill makes little progress in broadening the base for businesses by reducing business tax expenditures.

Looking beyond official tax expenditures

Table 2 examines other elements of the bill, beyond tax expenditures, that modify other elements of the business tax base. The largest and, from an economic efficiency standpoint, most important is the limit on net interest deductions. While not a traditional tax expenditure under an income tax, it would represent a tax expenditure under a consumption tax. Moreover, using a limitation on interest deductibility to reduce the corporate rate reduces the gap between the benefit tax rate on equity-financed investments versus debt-financed investments, shrinking an important tax distortion. The bill also raises modest amounts from a host of smaller changes to accounting rules, unrelated business income taxes paid by certain tax-exempt organizations, and limits on the deductibility of FDIC premiums by large banks (which is effectively an increase in the FDIC premiums they pay).

In addition, the bill raises revenue from several new sources. First, it denies a deduction for executive compensation paid by C-corporations in excess of $1 million (and imposes a similar excise tax on tax-exempt entities). This provision is effectively an increase in the marginal tax rate that applies to executive compensation, sending the rate to about 54 percent (including corporate, individual, and payroll tax that now would apply). Second, it imposes a new base erosion and anti-abuse tax primarily intended to reduce profit shifting by foreign-owned domestic businesses. Because foreign-owned businesses are not otherwise subject to the anti-avoidance rules imposed on U.S.-resident multinationals, this provision is intended to level the playing field by imposing similar rules. Third, the bill imposes a one-time tax on the untaxed, previously deferred foreign income of U.S. multinationals. The tax is well justified—if anything, the rate should be higher—but it also does not represent a broadening of the tax base because it only applies to income earned in the past not the tax base on income earned in the future. In this sense, it does not offset lower tax rates that apply to income in the future.

Finally, the bill raises substantial revenue ($295 billion) by limiting the deductibility of net operating loses (NOLs) of corporations and for other business owners. Under an income tax, operating losses should be deductible in full against current or past income, or carried forward with interest to offset future gains. (Indeed, this treatment was proposed in the original House blueprint.) Relative to this baseline, current-law limitations on NOLs represent a negative tax expenditure—a provision that increases the tax burden above that which should apply.

The distinction is not just semantical. New, growing businesses often incur losses when starting up, when the costs of new investments in plant equipment or staff salaries exceed initial revenues. Limiting the use (or carry forward) of such losses thereby imposes burdens on start ups. Moreover, the ability to carry forward and back NOLs is important for smoothing cash flows and insulating against risks at cyclical firms. For instance, during macroeconomic recessions or firm-level shocks (a bad year), firms use NOLs to reduce current taxes (or receive refunds from prior years) to help stay afloat. Limits on NOLs seem likely to exacerbate the cyclicality of business activity and business failures.

In conclusion, the Senate GOP plan does little to broaden the base. The bill imposes new taxes on targeted activities to pay for large tax rate decreases instead of aggressively closing tax loopholes that many have decried for years. This process is not only inefficient, but is also likely to come at the expense of greater economic growth.

We define tax expenditures to be business related if they accrue to corporate taxpayers in the Treasury estimates with the exception of the exclusion for tax-exempt bonds, which is a subsidy to state and local governments

The deduction for interest paid would be a tax expenditure relative to a consumption tax base.

The one-time tax applies only to historical income, and hence does not increase the tax rate on income earned prospectively.

However, we excluded provisions related to state and local bonds, which are a subsidy to states and localities, and provisions related to employee fringe benefits, which individual tax expenditures per the Joint Committee and Treasury.

Some argue that deferral of foreign-source income is not a tax expenditure if the baseline tax system excludes foreign-source income (e.g., is a “territorial system”) (Hines 2017). Even relative to such a baseline, however, the $176.6 billion revenue reduction reflects a narrowing in the tax base for affected U.S. resident firms. Expensing of investment is not a tax expenditure under a consumption tax base.

Because the JCT revenue estimates are “stacked” after the reduction of the corporate rate to 20 percent while the tax expenditures are estimated relative to a 35 percent rate, the percentage reduction in these expenditures is estimated by scaling up the revenue estimate by 35/20.
