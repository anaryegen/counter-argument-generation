You can register as an overseas voter if you’re either:

an eligible Irish citizen registering to vote in Northern Ireland

If you want to vote in England, Scotland or Wales, register to vote in the normal way.

If you want to vote in Northern Ireland, you need to register with a paper form.

There are different arrangements if you’re going to be abroad temporarily on election day.

Renewing your registration

Your registration lasts up to 3 years. You’ll get a reminder when it’s time to renew.

If you do not renew your registration, you’ll be removed from the register and must make a fresh application in order to vote again.

Voting if you’re registered as an overseas voter

You can vote in UK Parliament elections.

You may be able to vote in referendums. Each referendum has different rules on who can vote in it.

After you’ve decided you can:

apply online for a postal vote

apply by post for a postal vote
