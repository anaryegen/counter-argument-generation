Why Experiences are Better Than Things

written by havefundogood

Once we buy one thing, a better and newer version seems to be released. It’s a constant chase for temporary happiness. If only there was something out there that can bring us permanent, everlasting joy instead of the temporary happiness that things bring us. Well, guess what? There is. It’s called experience.

Things. We all want them. Buying things makes us feel happy. Owning material items apparently makes us look cool and like we’re of a higher status, right? We live in a society that literally grooms us to want more and more. Once we buy one thing, a better and newer version seems to be released. It’s a constant chase for temporary happiness. If only there was something out there that can bring us permanent, everlasting joy instead of the temporary happiness that things bring us. Well, guess what? There is. It’s called experience.

Experience brings us permanent joy that things cannot. Why? Well, experiences allow us to be more social, to have memories that never get old, and to have something interesting to talk about at holiday family reunions. They allow us to be more open and to find purpose.

Experiences allow us to be more social.

People need human interaction to survive (just think about how hard quarantine was). Two ways to have fun with friends and to make new long-lasting connections are through traveling and volunteering. When you meet others in new places and through volunteering, you get to bond with like-minded people. You get to talk to them, go on adventures together, and really get to know each other. You can’t have that same kind of connection with material things. Things can’t hold a heartfelt conversation or go surfing with you. People, however, can.

Experiences Bring Long-Lasting Memories

How often have you purchased a phone only to see that a new model was released a week later? You most likely no longer feel cool and wish you had the newer model. Things provide temporary happiness. They get old very, very quickly. Experiences, however, are different because they leave you with memories that last a lifetime. You can tell people your stories about the people you helped in Costa Rica, look at photos and videos (on your not-so-new new phone) of your new friends falling off their surfboard, and even just think to yourself about that one time you hiked up an entire mountain. Remembering these experiences will likely always cause happiness because memories never fade.

Experiences Will Make You Sound Cool at the Next Holiday Dinner

Family can be nosy. And if your family is anything like mine, they’ll probably ask you a million questions at the next family reunion.

Experiences will make you sound super interesting. You’ll be able to tell them about all the cool places you’ve visited. If you add stories of you doing community service to the stories of your travels, your family will think you’re adventurous, AND a good person. Telling your family about your latest trip is way cooler than telling them about your new watch.

Experiences Allow You to be More Open

Oftentimes, we live in a bubble. This bubble is shaped by the people and environment around you. Experiences help you to be more open by showing you new people, places, and ideas. Meeting others and having changes in scenery can challenge your perspective. You’ll question the world around you and see things from a new point of view. This allows you to be more open and to grow more as a person. Materialistic things can’t do all that.

Experiences Allow You to Find Your Purpose

Experiences can help you to have clarity and to feel productive. Maybe volunteering makes you realize that you want to help other people. Maybe traveling helps you see what kind of community you want to be surrounded by. Experiences can show you what your values are in life.

Have Fun Do Good is so much more than seeing beautiful sites with opportunities for volunteer. This was a chance to meet some incredible people that we would have otherwise never had the pleasure of meeting.
