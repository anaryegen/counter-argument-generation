HAMAS–the acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiyya (Islamic Resistance Movement)—is the largest and most capable militant group in the Palestinian territories and one of the territories’ two major political parties. HAMAS is committed to armed resistance against Israel and to the creation of a Palestinian state, and the group has engaged in several rounds of violent conflict with Israel. The most recent began on 7 October 2023, when HAMAS launched a massive surprise attack against Israel, killing nearly 1,200 people.

HAMAS emerged in 1987 during the first Palestinian uprising, or intifada, as an outgrowth of the Muslim Brotherhood’s Palestinian branch. HAMAS has been the de facto governing body in the Gaza Strip since 2007, when it ousted the Palestinian Authority from power. In 2017, HAMAS amended its charter to remove a call for Israel’s destruction. Nonetheless, the group does not recognize Israel as a state and continues to advocate all forms of resistance against the country.

OPERATING AREAS Primarily in the Gaza Strip; also maintains a presence in the West Bank; Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon; and other regional locations, such as Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey.

MEMBERS HAMAS probably has fewer than 20,000 fighters. It had between 20,000 and 25,000 fighters before the Israel-HAMAS conflict began in October 2023, which has reduced that number by thousands.

TACTICS AND TARGETS HAMAS uses improvised explosive devices, short- and long-range rockets and mortars, small arms, RPGs, MANPADs, antitank missiles, unmanned aircraft systems, and an extensive system of tunnels within Gaza to advance attacks against Israeli military forces and civilians. The group also engages in cyber espionage, computer network exploitation, and kidnapping operations. HAMAS uses hostage exchanges to gain concessions from the Israeli Government, including the release of high-value Palestinian prisoners from Israeli prisons.

FOREIGN TERRORIST GROUP DESIGNATION The US State Department designated HAMAS as a foreign terrorist organization in October 1997.

Israel’s border along the Gaza Strip

Hundreds of HAMAS fighters launch a surprise attack supported by rockets and armed drones, killing nearly 1,200 people and kidnapping at least 240. Along with Israelis, the victims include citizens of the United States and more than 30 other countries—almost all with dual Israeli citizenship.

HAMAS’s military wing, al-Qassam Brigades, claims full responsibility for the shooting of an Israeli guard in the West Bank. Other Palestinian militants also claim responsibility for the attack.

Gaza Strip and Israel

HAMAS launches more than 4,000 rockets at Israel during 11 days of hostilities; Israel responds with widespread air and artillery strikes on HAMAS targets in Gaza. The conflict results in 260 deaths in Gaza and 13 deaths in Israel.
