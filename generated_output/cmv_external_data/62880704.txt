Consequences of GMOs for biodiversity

Genetic modification produces genetically modified animals, plants and organisms. If they are introduced into the environment they can affect biodiversity. For example, existing species can be overrun by more dominant new species.

These and other potential effects are considered during the licensing procedure. (Such effects can of course also occur following the introduction of non-genetically modified animals plants and organisms.)

Assessing the impact on biodiversity requires knowledge. This knowledge must be constantly updated so the State can assess the effects of future GMOs on biodiversity. A major ecological research programme, ERGO, aimed to amass ecological knowledge, for example, on the impact of new GMOs on their environment. This research was coordinated by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO).
