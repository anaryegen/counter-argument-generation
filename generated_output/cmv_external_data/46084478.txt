version_five on April 16, 2022 | parent | context | favorite | on: The 'Batman Effect': How having an alter ego empow...

Just to nitpick, "Bruce Wayne" is the alter ego of batman, not the other way around, at least in the Chris Nolan movies. In reality he's smart and tough and hardened by the League of Shadows, etc. But as Bruce Wayne he plays a bimbo billionaire so that nobody will realize who he actually is.

And along the same vein, this quote from Kill Bill about Superman :

“Bill: Superman didn't become Superman. Superman was born Superman. When Superman wakes up in the morning, he's Superman. His alter ego is Clark Kent. His outfit with the big red "S", that's the blanket he was wrapped in as a baby when the Kents found him. Those are his clothes. What Kent wears - the glasses, the business suit - that's the costume. That's the costume Superman wears to blend in with us. Clark Kent is how Superman views us. And what are the characteristics of Clark Kent. He's weak... he's unsure of himself... he's a coward. Clark Kent is Superman's critique on the whole human race.”

Not just the Nolan movies; a number of comics mention that, and a memorable scene in Batman Beyond makes it even more explicit. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7yiN_Z5eg

Not to nitpick!, but by the end of Dark Knight Rises, it is "Bruce Wayne" that enjoys a relationship with Selina Kyle as... Bruce Wayne. Including a send off from Alfred. No? So... at least this can be viewed in different ways as it should I think.

In many comic books too. He thinks of himself as Batman, not Bruce Wayne, and never feels entirely comfortable without the mask.
