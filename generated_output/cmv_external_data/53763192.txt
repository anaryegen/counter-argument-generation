What is the current evidence of the social construction of attractiveness?

There is ample evidence demonstrating that attractiveness is constrained by biological motives. Facial attractiveness has been positively related to reproductive success (Jokela, 2009; Rhodes et al., 2005), health and longevity (Henderson and Anglin, 2003; Shackelford and Larsen, 1999), immunocompetence (Jones et al., 2001; Scheib et al., 1999), immune function (Klein, 2000; Lie et al., 2008; Roberts et al., 2005; Roney et al., 2006), and healthy aging and diet (Fink et al., 2001; Jones et al., 2004; Matts et al., 2007; Stephen et al., 2012).

However, is evident, and some theorists argue, that socialization also plays an important role. The attractive patterns are different in different societies and times; and other non-physical aspects, such as intelligence, humour or creativity, also influence this. While some theorists consider that attractiveness ratings are universal, while others state that they are highly idyosincratic.

¿What is the current state of the art on sociological accounts of attractiveness?

Many many thanks for your response.

Although most work on attractiveness has been focused from the Biologicism/ universalism perspective, there is no doubt that there is plenty of room for other social or intrapersonal influences.

Great contribution!!!

I cannot weigh in as a sociologist, but I can say that in psychology it seems as if the primary effort on the part of researchers has been to find universals rather than look for cultural differences (for whatever reason). This is not to say that the notion of cultural relativity is totally absent. For example, Wheeler and Kim (1997) have noted that Koreans (unlike Americans) do not rate attractive faces in a way so as to imply that they indicate "potency", and they rated them as having more integrity and concern for others (again, unlike most Americans). Hope this helps.

Yes, this is really helpful.

Kniffin Wilson has a paper suggesting that personality affects attractiveness ratings. As I recall, they used yearbook photos and examined ratings at beginning and end of class (before and after personalities were well known). I haven't read it in a bit, but here is the link: http://evolution.binghamton.edu/dswilson/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/DSW13.pdf

Also, check out this paper by Little et al. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3130383/

It is rather difficult to study experimentally the effects of culture, et cetera, on perceptions of attractiveness. Maybe history/ethnography would be better guides. But, studies strongly suggest that perceptions of facial beauty are universal/cross cultural, probably even more so than bodily beauty.

Can you have insignificant indirect effect even the a-path and b-path were both significant?

Asked 30th Dec, 2021

Need some advise please on how to interpret of this one. I have performed mediation analysis using WarpPLS and the result was little bit weird. Is it possible to have insignificant indirect effect even both path a and b were significant? The a path coefficient is 0.13 pvalue 0.009 while b path is 0.12 pvaliu 0.013. Now, Indirect effect is 0.017 with 0.335 which is not significant.

In a mediation analysis, is it a problem if there is no significant direct effect between X and Y, but the indirect effect is significant?

Asked 19th Nov, 2021

In a mediation analysis, the direct effect between DV and IV is non-significant. However, the indirect effect becomes significant when the mediating variable comes into play. I often read in sources that for mediation analysis there must be a relationship between DV and IV. According to my logic, if a variable makes a normally non-significant relationship significant, it should be possible to talk about a significant mediating effect there. How would you interpret this? And would such a situation pose a problem? Thank you in advance for your answers along with your source suggestion on the subject.

Mediation for Repeated Measures?

Asked 31st Aug, 2021

I'm conducting a within-subjects research study, and need some help.

In the study, participants are I measure participants mindset (Independent Variable), their Job Performance (Dependent Variable) and three mediators. I then use a video to manipulate participants mindset, and then collect data on all the variables again in 4 weeks time.

Therefore, this is a multi-level mediation model in a repeated-measures within-subject study. What sort of test would be appropriate to analyze the data? I've come across MEMORE (Mediation and Moderation for Repeated Measures) by Amanda Montoya, but haven't found any tutorials to be able to execute this. What other statistical techniques I can use for multi-level mediation in a repeated measures study?

How to conduct mediator analysis for experimental study?

Asked 18th Apr, 2021

I am doing the experimental study about how model body size impact brand image. I had 2 condition (using models in different sizes on ad and using just thin models) to test the effect on different brand image dimensions.

I collect two data set and combine it into one with one more variable ‘Condition’. I considered ‘condition’ as independent variable and the brand image dimensions as dependent variables.

During the work I found out that the ‘attitude towards ad’ can be a mediator intervening within the relationship between model body size and brand attitude. I conduct Mediator analysis using PROCESS by Andrew F. Hayes on spss and received the output showing that there is indirect effect of attitude towards ad from model body size on brand attitude. However, the ouput conduct regression test (Attitude towards ad with condition) and (Attitude towards brand with condition). I feel that this regression test is inappropriate so how should I interpret the mediator analysis?

Indirect effect, but no direct/main effect - same signs (so not suppression)?

Asked 29th Mar, 2021

In a simple mediation analysis I have a significant indirect effect, but no direct or total effect. I know some studies report this indirect effect as evidence of mediation, but from the examples I found it appears this exists for cases of suppression. From Kenny's website suppression exists if c' is the opposite sign to ab (and cites MacKinnon et al., 2007). However, in my analyses the c' (the direct effect) is the same sign to ab. When c' is positive ab is positive, and in another analysis when c' is negative ab is negative. Can I conclude mediation from this? If so, does anyone have examples of papers that do this? Thanks in advance!

How to compare two samples with different sample size?

Asked 27th Apr, 2020

I need to compare two samples, one sample has 500 data points and other sample has 100 data points? Which would be the best way to compare them? I learned online that T-test will not be the best method to do this. Any suggestion?

How do I assess moderation among a mixed between-group and repeated measures experiment??

Im conducting an experiment with 2 independent categorical groups (say condition A and B) and am measuring a continuous variable at 2 time points (pre and post manipulation).

One of my hypothesis is in regards to moderation (by a continuous variable) so I’m unsure how to analyze this moderation given that my design is a mix of between group comparison (IV = condition) and within-subject change in score (DV= A continuous repeated measure).

i don’t know how to approach this and my head is spinning trying to work it out!!

should I compute a variable that is the change In DV between the 2 times and then conduct analysis of the interaction via regression?? Or the SPSS process command?

Help is soooo appreciated

Can you have mediation if either the a- or b-path are not significant?

Asked 31st Jan, 2017

I have conducted a multiple mediation analysis that uses positive and negative coping strategies as two separate mediators in the relationship between illness perceptions and fatigue. I have significant indirect effect for positive coping. But when I look at the a- and b-paths, the a-path is not significant. Is it possible to have mediation if one of the pathways between the IV, mediator, and DV is not significant?
