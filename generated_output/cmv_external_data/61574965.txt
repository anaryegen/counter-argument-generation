Parental Consent and Notification Laws

The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which means that states can now ban abortion at any stage in pregnancy. Some states have banned abortion or created lots of restrictions. But abortion is NOT banned nationwide. Abortion is still legal in many states, and it's legal to travel to a different state to get an abortion.

Laws about abortion continue to change — this page is updated often, but it may not have the newest information. You can find more information about laws in your state and how to get an abortion at AbortionFinder.org.

If abortion is legal in your state, or if you're traveling to another state where abortion is legal, there may still be other laws that affect you if you're under 18. The exact rules are different in different places. Find general information on your state below.

Some states say you have to get permission from a parent, legal guardian, or older family member to have an abortion. Other states don’t make you get permission, but your parents will have to know that you’re getting an abortion. And some states don't have any laws about telling your parents or getting their permission. In some states, even with laws that generally require a parent’s permission, you may not have to involve your parent in certain circumstances, like if you’ve experienced abuse. The information below is an overview of the laws in each state and doesn’t necessarily cover all exceptions.

Also, if your state does have parental involvement laws, you may be able to get a judge's permission to have an abortion without telling your parents. This is called "judicial bypass."

If you have questions about whether you can get an abortion without involving your parent, if you would like help navigating the judicial bypass process, or if you don’t have your parents in your life and want to understand your options, you can contact the If/When/How Judicial Bypass Helpline by calling 844-868-2812 or submitting a request online.

You’re not alone. If you’re pregnant and want to have an abortion, contact your nearest Planned Parenthood health center as soon as possible. They can help explain the laws in your state, let you know what your options are, and help you talk with your parents. You can also visit AbortionFinder.org.

Be careful to go to a real health center and not a crisis pregnancy center — these are anti-abortion clinics that don’t offer a full range of real health care, won’t give you honest information about your pregnancy options, and usually don’t have to follow privacy laws. Planned Parenthood or AbortionFinder.org can help you find a trustworthy health care provider.

It's important to take action right away. Abortion is very safe, but there are more risks the longer you wait. If you need a judicial bypass, it can take a while to get through the process. There are also time limits on abortion in some states. And if you live in a state where abortion is illegal, you may have to go to another state to get an abortion, and it can take time to arrange travel. Planned Parenthood or another trusted abortion provider can explain your options and connect you with resources that may be able to help you make an appointment and pay for travel or other costs.
