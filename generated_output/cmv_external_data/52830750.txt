po·​ten·​tial pə-ˈten(t)-shəl 

Synonyms of potential

: existing in possibility : capable of development into actuality

: expressing possibility

specifically : of, relating to, or constituting a verb phrase expressing possibility, liberty, or power by the use of an auxiliary with the infinitive of the verb (as in "it may rain")

: something that can develop or become actual

a potential for violence

: any of various functions from which the intensity or the velocity at any point in a field may be readily calculated

: the work required to move a unit positive charge from a reference point (as at infinity) to a point in question

Potential can be either good or bad. Studying hard increases the potential for success, but wet roads increase the potential for accidents. But when a person or thing "has potential", we always expect something good from it in the future. As an adjective (as in "potential losses", "potential benefits", etc.), potential usually means simply "possible". In science, however, the adjective has a special meaning: Potential energy is the kind of stored energy that a boulder sitting at the top of a cliff has (the opposite of kinetic energy, which is what it has as it rolls down that cliff).
