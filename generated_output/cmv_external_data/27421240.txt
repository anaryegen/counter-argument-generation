What should teachers understand about effective classroom behavior management?

Page 3: Cultural Influences on Behavior

When they reflect on comprehensive classroom behavior management, teachers should always keep in mind that one of the major influences on behavior is the students’ culture. Culture is a word we use to loosely describe any of the beliefs, norms, and practices characteristic of a particular society, group, or place. And because teachers themselves come from particular societies, groups, and places, they must be mindful that their own beliefs and practices can be likewise influenced, as can the broader policies, practices, and expectations of the schools and districts in which they teach.

Culture is such a powerful influence on our outlooks and behaviors that often we are not even aware of it, instead believing our perspectives are “just the way things are.” In the context of increasingly diverse classroom settings, such unexamined beliefs can lead to avoidable conflict and a loss of valuable instructional time.

For Your Information

Cultural differences are particularly important to understand as the U.S. student population becomes more and more racially, ethnically, and linguistically diverse. In the 2017–2018 school year, 53 percent of elementary and secondary students identified as a race or ethnicity other than white. On the other hand, during that same period 79 percent of public school teachers were white and non-Hispanic. Even in schools where the majority of the student population was from diverse racial or ethnic populations, the majority of teachers were white. This disparity in cultural and racial backgrounds and experiences can lead to unique challenges and potential misunderstandings.

Description: Cultural data graph

A pair of pie charts is used to contrast the ethnic makeup of students and teachers. The chart on the left is labeled ‘Students’ and is divided as follows: 47% white/non-Hispanic (blue), 27% Hispanic (gray), 15% Black/non-Hispanic (orange), 6% other (green), and 5% Asian/non-Hispanic (yellow). The chart on the right is labeled ‘Teachers’ and is divided as follows: 79% white/non-Hispanic (blue), 9% Hispanic (gray), 7% Black/non-Hispanic (orange), 3% other (green), and 2% Asian/non-Hispanic (yellow).

Defining Cultural Gaps

For Your Information

Race is not synonymous with culture. However, racial identity is the product of social, historical, and political contexts, and thus students’ racial and cultural identities often share many commonalities.

Although there are many different cultures within the United States, the education system’s definition of what is “appropriate behavior” typically reflects white, middle-class cultural norms and values. These norms are reflected in broader school district practices and policies, as well as classroom expectations around behavior, communication, classroom dynamics, and family engagement. This can result in a cultural gap. In education, a cultural gap refers to any significant disparity in world views, values, and expectations that exist between a teacher (or the school culture as a whole) and racially and ethnically diverse students. Often times, these disparities negatively impact the success of diverse student populations.

Any of the shared rules, expectations, and practices that guide, inform, or influence the behavior of people in a certain culture or social group.

When we take into account the fact that student populations are becoming more and more diverse while the majority of classroom instructors are not, this cultural gap becomes especially acute. It’s important for teachers to identify and anticipate cultural gaps that may influence their behaviors and interactions with their students, preferably before they occur.

Identifying Cultural Gaps

Once we are aware of the possibility of these culture gaps—and the problems that might arise because of them—we can take thoughtful steps toward a better, more thorough understanding of them. What do cultural gaps actually look like in practice? How might they affect interactions between a teacher and her students in a real classroom setting? Take a moment to read through the table below. Though by no means exhaustive, the examples included here illustrate certain specific perspectives and approaches that might result in cultural gaps.

Differing Cultural Perspectives

Respect for authority figures

Teachers are automatically regarded as an authority figure (based on role/position or age).

As a new member of the community, teachers must earn respect.

Relationships with community

Teachers are expected to collaborate with family members or community elders.

Students and families expect teachers to act independently.

Standing very close to someone when speaking is seen as violating personal space.

Standing very close to someone when speaking indicates a close relationship.

Eye contact conveys listening.

A lack of eye contact indicates deference or respect.

Verbally conveying information in a direct and assertive manner is valued.

Verbally conveying information in an indirect and passive manner is valued.

Providing directions

Providing directions in the form of a question (e.g., “Can you join us for group time?”) implies an expectation to comply.

Providing directions in the form of a question implies an expectation of choice or an option to decline.

Students who listen and remain quiet are respectfully engaged.

Students who actively participate are engaged.

Families who participate in school events are considered to be interested and involved in their child’s education.

There is a clear distinction between the role of the teacher and that of the family: Academics is the sole responsibility of the teachers while families provide instruction on skills and knowledge needed at home and in the community.

For Your Information

Cultural gaps can cause teachers to misinterpret students’ behavior, which can lead to conflict. These conflicts can have a range of effects: students feeling misunderstood or marginalized, higher rates of discipline referrals, and students leaving school altogether.

Although teachers should have an understanding of the differing cultural perspectives of their students, they should also keep in mind that not everyone with the same ethnic or racial background has the same values. In other words, teachers should avoid cultural stereotypes—oversimplified beliefs used to define a culture or group of people.

In the same way, teachers should reflect on their own cultural perspectives, values, beliefs, and behaviors. By understanding their own cultural perspectives, those of their students, and those promoted by the school, teachers can better identify cultural gaps. Once teachers understand why these gaps exist, they are ready to learn how to address them.

Think about a group of students you are currently working with or may work with in the future. Using the information above, consider these questions.

How do your values and beliefs influence your classroom practices?

Where might cultural gaps exist between you and your students?

How might you respond differently to students whose behaviors and interactions do not align with your own cultural perspectives?

Transcript: Ashley Lloyd

When teaching children from different cultures, I have had 11 years of experiences now that have helped me learn that the most important thing to remind myself is that what seems natural and expected behavior to me is not always a natural, expected behavior in all cultures. The strongest, most beneficial strategy that I have found for digging deeper and learning more about my students’ culture is a morning community circle: Taking the time to talk to students and giving them low-risk opportunities to speak about themselves leads to be able to have deeper conversations and have them feel confident and comfortable that they can reveal about their personal lives and express what is important in their culture and how things might be different than what they’re seeing in school. And I find that it also allows to have deeper relationships with the children, and they start inviting me into opportunities where I can immerse myself into their culture. They invite me to their sporting events, their parties, things like that. And then I’m able to learn more about them that way, as well. I’ve had some really cool experiences where I’ve been able to immerse myself in the cultures of other children. And one example was I was actually sadly included in the funeral of one of my student’s mothers, and I went to the child’s church, and during the service the children were never expected to be sitting or quiet. It was just natural to that culture that the children were up and moving and talking to other adults. And it made me realize that in the church that I attend everyone is to sit and be quiet. To these children, this was normal and natural. So when I’m expecting them to be sitting and quiet, that might be unnatural to them, and it might be something that they need practice and examples and repeated exposure to before it becomes natural to them.

A few ways that I have addressed culture gaps is personally—starting with me—self-reflection, learning what my views are, learning and admitting that I didn’t know all that I should have known, but being willing to learn it. Eliminating implicit bias, which is, like it or not, we all have them. The benefit is identifying them and then working through them. And that has opened many doors just in my personal life and in my work life with my colleagues. Another piece has been just having courageous conversations, and I think that’s a wide spectrum. But for me, what I’ve experienced is it’s OK to ask a question and not to have malice behind it. It’s one thing to not know, to be ignorant in something, and not be malicious. And I think that has helped within our staff, and I think it helps with our interaction with our students, because you don’t know what you don’t know. So if you’re able to ask or you’re able to read a book or able to sit through PD and receive some wonderful information, I think that truly helps us to achieve that closing of the culture gaps.

A culture gap that I’ve experienced with one of my students, a young lady, and she was explaining the quinceañera to me, which I’d heard of the term. I understood it was a party. The pieces I didn’t understand was it’s very intricate. It’s almost the pieces of a wedding for this young lady who’s turning 15. My student was not turning 15. She was going to be in the quinceañera, but she would come in every day explaining: They went for their dress fitting. They had to pick out their colors, their shoes, their fingernails. And she was sharing in a small-group setting. And it was interesting to see the interplay between the other three students and this young lady. They were asking questions. I was asking questions. She was very open and super excited to share with us all the pieces that were going into this quinceañera, and the other students had wonderful questions. They didn’t realize it was such a big deal for this culture and a young lady turning 15. So a few of the kids asked do you get this when you’re 20, which was a great question because why not increments of five? Another student asked do the boys get a party, or is it only for girls? She was very nice and patient and did a wonderful job of explaining it. And every day she came back, we had a new question for her, and we were just as excited for the event as she was.

So in a situation where there is a gap of information when it comes to me and another student’s culture, I’ll make sure that in a separate environment during a separate time period, not necessarily in front of the rest of the classroom with that student, to ask questions, to both ask how they were feeling about what happened in that moment, but then also how to better my understanding of that moment. That in turn gives students the understanding that I care, and that I want to know more, but also gives them some kind of power over the education that I’m getting, so that I understand what that means, not just about their culture, but what that means for them and how that affects them personally. And then after talking with the student and clarifying the situation and then also asking them what they would like to see in that classroom going forward, would they prefer me to speak to the class when they’re not there, when they are there, and what would make them the most comfortable going forward to make sure that the students in the classroom understand as well as I do? I think, again, returning that power to that student, because in those moments of gaps they feel powerless, and giving them some kind of power over the education of the people around them when it comes to their cultural or socioeconomic or racial differences, I think really helps them regain that strength that they may have lost in that moment.

Addressing Cultural Gaps

For Your Information

When working with students, teachers should take an asset-based approach, rather than a deficit-based approach. Recognizing and understanding why students behave in certain ways can prevent misunderstandings based on cultural differences.

asset-based approach

Acknowledging and promoting the strengths of diverse students rather than focusing on perceived shortcomings or weaknesses.

deficit-based approach

Focusing on perceived shortcomings of diverse students and addressing weaknesses rather than acknowledging and building on their strengths.

Because cultural gaps can impact engagement with students, teachers should create a classroom where students’ cultures are acknowledged, respected, and reflected. They can do this by implementing culturally sustaining practices—practices that not only accept but foster students’ cultural norms and values. These practices are designed to recognize and bridge cultural gaps and represent a shift from the traditional focus of schools, where students are expected to adopt white, middle class norms and to change or shed behaviors that don’t align with the school’s or teacher’s expectations.

Although culturally sustaining practices may look different depending on the context, teachers can:

Many districts have personnel who can offer teachers information, training, and supports on topics related to equity, diversity, and inclusion. This can include cultural liaisons and community outreach specialists with personal knowledge and understanding of the cultures represented in the community. These professionals can help teachers develop the knowledge necessary to implement culturally sustaining practices.

Evaluate current classroom practices

Identify the foundations of existing practices

Review practices to determine and reduce potential areas of culturally based conflict

If cultural gaps exist, determine whether practices have to be done in a particular way or whether changes can be made

Establish and teach clear classroom expectations that help students feel safe and secure

Be open with students about differences in school practices and expectations and those in the home or community

Incorporate the cultures of the students in the classroom by:

Making sure that the curricula and materials reflect the historical and contemporary cultures of the children represented in the classroom and in the community

Bringing in community and family members as part of regular classroom practice

Listen as Lori Delale-O’Connor discusses culturally sustaining practices. Next, listen as she explains how culture plays a role in classroom behavior management practices and why it is important to examine these practices with a cultural lens.

Culturally sustaining practices

I think culturally sustaining practices really focuses on taking an asset-based approach to young people. That means seeing the value of everything that they’re bringing in, and not seeking to change them but seeking to support them in developing who they are in concert with all the things that they’re learning in the classroom. And so that means drawing in their home life, their community life, and not just drawing it in as examples but connecting the learning, connecting what’s happening in the classroom so that students are able to not only strengthen what they’re taking away but to strengthen their connections to those communities. And so that, I think, is the difference between really thinking about culturally responsive, which is responding to who students are and where they’re coming from and their experiences and their different ways of being. But it’s taking it an additional step further and saying, not only do we value that and talk about it in the classroom but let’s see how we can connect our classroom practices so that your space and your family and your community is enhanced by what we’re doing in the classroom. It’s responsive and then an additional step of really supporting and enhancing, so students are constantly growing in their cultural understanding of themselves, of each other, and of their communities.

I think a lot of times we take for granted the particular practices and policies of schools without questioning why they’re there or who put them in or how long they’ve been there or, most importantly, how and whether they are serving both teachers and young people in their work. So my first thought around culturally sustaining practices in general is to just understand what the culture of a space or place is. I think a lot of times we think that school culture is a neutral thing. So to examine that gives us a better understanding first of what it is. And I think the second thing that ties in closely with examining them is supporting teachers and young people and seeing them transparently. Let’s talk about why a student’s behavior or students’ behavior more generally may not align with the school and may not align with what those expectations are. And why is that? And do they need to change, do these expectations? If we feel that they still don’t need to change then how can we help students and support them in sort of living in concert with those with those expectations, and how do we support those? If I’m a teacher, I might say your behavior looks this way and that looks very, very different from our rules. Let’s talk about why that is and what changes need to be made, again either in the rules or in the behaviors. And how can I best support that? A lot of times I think it can be helpful, especially as we’re talking about sustaining, which really means not only acknowledging but supporting young people in bringing in not just the young people and the teachers but also families, caregivers, or community members to both acknowledge and support those differences as well. At the core, we need to remember the role of schools is really to support and serve young people. And if it is not serving them well, it’s not supporting their learning, then why is that and what might need to change?

How culture plays a role

As we think about culture as part of larger behavior classroom management, I think part of it is recognizing that we all need to be examining our practices from the onset, not just when things aren’t working or the classroom is erupting into a scene that nobody wants, that is not serving the teacher, that is not serving the students in their learning. Recognizing one’s own culture and recognizing students’ culture and supporting them and recognizing it and connecting all those things may be one of the first and foremost things that educators can do to have a smoothly running classroom. I think connecting with that is also building relationships with students, with their families, with the community, and that is in part because it helps you to better understand the students as cultural beings. And so in some ways it can be responsive, but it also can serve as the precursor really to setting up your classroom dynamic that can help to have a smooth flow in your classroom but also can help when you return to it to say, oh, hey, we established this together. Let’s talk about this. Or we didn’t recognize that this might be an area where we’re clashing, but we have already developed this sort of respect and acknowledgment for each other as cultural beings. We’ve already started to establish this communication. So my response is not to yell at you. It’s to wonder why you were engaging in this behavior. And your response as a young person may not be to say I’m going to act in this way, but instead to say, hey, we talked about this, and I feel like I’m not being respected, or what we talked about isn’t being respected. And so culture is a fundamental aspect of establishing what your classroom is going to look like and then supporting the ways that that students can engage with each other and can engage with you as you move forward.

To learn more about cultural influences on behavior and how demographic differences can lead to cultural gaps that negatively impact students, we encourage you to listen to Lori Delale-O’Connor in this extended IRIS Interview. In addition, she offers examples of how teachers can implement culturally sustaining practices to create inclusive classrooms where all students feel supported.

Ms. Rollison — The Story Unfolds

Recall that Ms. Rollison expects her students to raise their hands to speak. In her classroom, a group of students repeatedly calls out questions and responses and appears to talk over each other. Because this behavior does not align with her expectation, she sees it as “rude” or “violating classroom rules.” The group of students, however, is used to learning from each other in a group context and consider their verbal behavior as appropriate and supportive.

How can Ms. Rollison bridge this cultural gap? Rather than correcting or disciplining the students until they follow the rules, Ms. Rollison can:

Strive to understand the differences between the expected behaviors in the classroom and acceptable behaviors in students’ communities.

Consider why she (and the school) require students to share and participate in such a structured manner.

Engage in a conversation around these differences and work to build a classroom community that acknowledges them and bridges this cultural gap.
