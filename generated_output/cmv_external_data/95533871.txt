In a previous project involving the same audio assets, and generating over 7.5 million consumer data points, SoundOut had already identified and mapped the conscious effect of the same music with input from over 500,000 consumers. Full details of the methodology and the results will be released in a white paper containing a more detailed description and analysis of the research on 25 May 2022.
