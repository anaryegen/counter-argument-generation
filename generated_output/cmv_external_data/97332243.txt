An 'Alternative Economy' refers to processes of production, exchange, and consumption that differ from the mainstream capitalist economy. It can be defined as intentional and self-conscious efforts, often undertaken on a local scale, that aim to create economic spaces and practices that are different from and resistant to the dominant economic system. These alternative economies can include household economies, gift giving, self-employment, and other noncapitalist economic practices.

Alternative Economies

Stephen Healy, in International Encyclopedia of Human Geography (Second Edition), 2020

Interest in alternative economies has grown among economic geographers alongside a global proliferation of international social movements such as the solidarity economy over the past decade. Although there is agreement that the alternative economy refers to processes of production, exchange, and consumption that differ from the so-called capitalist mainstream, scholars are divided as to how to define alternativeness theoretically. The realist approach takes the alternative to be intentional and self-conscious efforts, usually undertaken on a local scale. Frequently, these efforts are understood as embattled spaces of difference surrounded by a larger economy that threatens to erase them. The second approach relies upon the key concept of performativity; from this perspective, discourse participates in producing the reality it purports to represent. From this perspective, the marginal status of ubiquitous noncapitalist economic spaces and practices—household economies, gift giving, self-employment—are performatively constituted. The latter conceptualization of economic alternatives as ubiquitous but discursively subordinated politicizes research in a particular way. Many scholars interested in alternative economies are involved with action research projects whose aim is to illuminate and strengthen valued elements of a diverse economy and promote ethical practices of economic difference.Read more

Economies, Alternative

S. Healy, in International Encyclopedia of Human Geography, 2009

Economic geographers have become increasingly interested in alternative economies in the past decade. While there is agreement that the alternative economy refers to processes of production, exchange, and consumption that differ from the so-called capitalist mainstream, scholars are divided as to how to define alternativeness theoretically. The realist approach takes the alternative to be intentional and self-conscious efforts, usually undertaken on a local scale. Frequently, these efforts are understood as embattled spaces of difference surrounded by a larger economy that threatens to erase them. The second approach to defining the alternative economy relies upon the key concept of performativity; from this perspective, discourse participates in producing the reality it purports to represent. Starting with the observation that noncapitalist economic spaces and practices – household economies, gift giving, barter, alternative finance, self-employment, and cooperatives – are ubiquitous across space and through time and yet remain hidden from view, it theorizes their marginal status as performatively constituted. The latter conceptualization of economic alternatives as ubiquitous but discursively subordinated politicizes research in a particular way. Many scholars interested in alternative economies are involved with action research projects whose aim is to illuminate and strengthen valued elements of a diverse economy and promote ethical practices of economic difference.Read more

Alternative Economies

Stephen Healy, in International Encyclopedia of Human Geography (Second Edition), 2020

The Trouble With Alternatives

The term “alternative,” by its very nature, underscores a foundational insight from modern linguistic theory—that no term derives its meaning self-referentially. The existence of an “alternative” economy implies that there is a dominant or mainstream economy against which the alternative is defined. Moreover, the perceived spatial extent and viability of alternatives are shaped by how one understands the dominance of the mainstream economy. Not surprisingly, this issue is a principal point of contention among scholars interested in alternative economies.

Those who understand dominance from a realist epistemological perspective believe that it is possible to gauge relative degrees of power and the extent of vulnerability or powerlessness. They therefore almost always see alternative economies and organizations as weak and likely to be short lived. Those who understand dominance as performative, on the other hand, see it as predicated upon and produced by the dissemination and repetition of knowledge. Neoliberalism, for example, has become hegemonic in large part because academic knowledge, policy discourses, protest movements, and bureaucratic technologies of enactment have made it the focus of belief and action, bringing it into being in both authoritarian and democratic settings. From this perspective, the continual interruptions, large omissions, and widening gaps in the performance of neoliberalism are openings for the other discourses and technologies that are always already participating in bringing different economies into being.

The question that continues to be centrally important is this: whether the alternative economy really is a marginal set of activities or if it is performatively marginalized. The answer to this question will determine the future direction of research into alternative economies. One interesting feature of this debate is that adherents of the performative perspective are frequently regarded by those adopting the realist perspective as idealists who imagine that thinking differently—an intellectual commitment to celebrating noncapitalist spaces and practices—is all that is required to change the world. Celebration here is effectively a code word for an idealist naiveté that ignores the reality of capitalism and a devolved neoliberal state dedicated to its expanded reproduction. But what if the way in which this reality is invoked to rein in the potential study of something other than capitalism is itself part of what keeps capitalism dominant? Perhaps, the persuasiveness of the argument that capitalism is the real economy, while the alternative economy is fanciful celebration, is the ultimate confirmation of performativity.

Research based on the realist vision of the alternative economy tends to focus on how self-consciously alternative economies are defined by their vulnerabilities—how their marginal status undermines their normative commitments or how they are always in danger of being outcompeted by the mainstream or in coming to resemble BaU. Alternative food movement spaces such as farmer's markets and Community Support Agriculture, food and consumer cooperatives are regularly treated by scholars as marginal food spaces that replicate forms of class privilege and racial exclusion, while longstanding successful experiments such as the Mondragon Cooperative Corporation are represented as having betrayed their principles through their strategic decisions around internationalization. The trouble here is not that the alternative food movement space can be exclusionary or that Mondragon may well have become a form of collective capitalism. Indeed, these are real possibilities, but when we read these particular outcomes as evidence of an intrinsic deficiency, the term alternative comes to signify inevitable compromise, cooptation, or failure.

This a-priori assumption creates a theoretical blindness. When market forces, government institutions and cultural norms are presumed to be arrayed against alternative economies, we do not look for the circumstances where they might enable their development. And under those conditions, almost inevitably, alternativeness is reduced to sameness. The continued existence of alternative economic institutions—community-based credit unions, for example—is seen as threatened by the dominant ideology that governs finance; the laws of local, state, and national government; and the market forces that favor large capitalist firms. At the same time, it is imagined that alternative economic practices and institutions, such as local economic trading systems exist only in spaces of deprivation where they are a necessity or, conversely, in spaces of privilege where they can be indulged in. The premise here is clearly a binary opposition in which superior qualities are ascribed to the capitalist-mainstream. While alternative economic institutions are conceived as existing only in contingent circumstances, the presumed dominance of mainstream financial institutions creates the appearance that they exist autonomously, independent of conditions. More recently, this same logic now presumes to tell us what will transpire in the domain of the online sharing economy: that platform capitalists like Uber, will live up to their name, inevitably triumphant.

Foreseeing the term alternative as an epistemic bear trap, Gibson-Grahamin, The End of Capitalism, attempt to replace the binary opposition of mainstream and alternative with a conception of the economy as a space of difference. In this vision, self-consciously alternative economic activities constitute a fraction of the noncapitalist and alternative capitalist activity within a differentiated economic landscape. The economy is understood as being composed of many different processes of production, exchange, ownership, work, remuneration, and consumption without the presumption of necessary relations of dominance and subordination. The alternative economy as economic difference constitutes a distinct economic ontology that of diverse economies: a scholarship that centers community engagement and action research as the basis of its performative efficacy.Read more

The Trouble with Alternatives

The term ‘alternative’, by its very nature, underscores a foundational insight from modern linguistic theory – that no term derives its meaning self-referentially. The existence of an ‘alternative’ economy implies that there is a dominant or mainstream economy against which the alternative is defined. Moreover, the perceived spatial extent and viability of alternatives are shaped by how one understands the dominance of the mainstream economy.

Those who understand dominance from a realist epistemological perspective believe that it is possible to gauge relative degrees of power and the extent of vulnerability or powerlessness. They therefore almost always see alternative economies and organizations as weak and likely to be short-lived. Those who understand dominance as performative, on the other hand, see it as predicated upon and produced by the dissemination and repetition of knowledges. Neoliberalism, for example, has become hegemonic in large part because academic knowledges, policy discourses, protest movements, and bureaucratic technologies of enactment have made it the focus of belief and action, bringing it into being in both authoritarian and democratic settings. From this perspective, the continual interruptions, large omissions, and widening gaps in the performance of neoliberalism are openings for the other discourses and technologies that are always already participating in bringing different economies into being.

The resolution of this central debate as to whether the alternative economy really is a marginal set of activities or if it is performatively marginalized will determine the future direction of research into alternative economies. One interesting feature of this debate is that adherents of the performative perspective are frequently regarded by those adopting the realist perspective as idealists who imagine that thinking differently – an intellectual commitment to celebrating noncapitalist spaces and practices – is all that is required to change the world. Celebration here is effectively a code word for an idealist naiveté that ignores the reality of capitalism and a devolved neoliberal state dedicated to its expanded reproduction. But what if the way in which this reality is invoked to reign in the potential study of something other than capitalism is itself part of what keeps capitalism dominant? Perhaps the persuasiveness of the argument that capitalism is the real economy, while the alternative economy is fanciful celebration, is the ultimate confirmation of performativity.

Research based on the realist vision of the alternative economy tends to focus on self-consciously alternative economic institutions and practices such as the self-employed retro-retailers studied by Crewe, Gregson, and Brooks. These enterprises are threatened simultaneously by self-employment burnout and by conventional stores targeting the same demographic. The researchers’ analysis reflects a frequently expressed concern that the alternative is contingent and vulnerable in comparison with the systemic and encompassing dominant economy. The premise here is clearly a binary opposition in which superior qualities are ascribed to the mainstream.

If the alternative economy is understood from the outset as intrinsically deficient, it is not surprising that alternativeness is always vulnerable to erasure. Market competition, cultural cooptation, and state repression are seen as forces arrayed against the alternative economy that will, almost inevitably, reduce alternativeness to sameness. The continued existence of alternative economic institutions – community-based credit unions, for example – is seen as threatened by the dominant ideology that governs finance, the laws of local, state, and national government, and the market forces that favor large capitalist firms. At the same time, it is imagined that alternative economic practices and institutions, such as local economic trading systems (LETSs), can exist only on the margins either in spaces that have been abandoned by traditional financial institutions (poor blighted communities) or in locations with progressive and affluent populations that can elect to sustain them. While alternative economic institutions are conceived as existing only in contingent circumstances, the presumed dominance of mainstream financial institutions creates the appearance that they exist autonomously, independent of conditions.

Gibson-Graham’s work attempts to replace the binary opposition of mainstream and alternative with a conception of the economy as a space of difference. In this vision, self-consciously alternative economic activities constitute a fraction of the noncapitalist and alternative capitalist activity within a differentiated economic landscape. The economy is understood as being composed of many different processes of production, exchange, ownership, work, remuneration, and consumption without the presumption of necessary relations of dominance and subordination. The alternative economy as economic difference constitutes a new economic ontology whose performative efficacy depends upon and produces an approach to scholarship that is centered on community engagement and action research.Read more

Alternative Economies

Stephen Healy, in International Encyclopedia of Human Geography (Second Edition), 2020

Alternative Economies

(1) Processes of production, exchange, labor/compensation, finance, and consumption that are intentionally different from mainstream (capitalist) economic activity; and (2) an alternative representation of economy as a heterogeneous and proliferative social space.

The form in which surplus (in labor, value, or product form) is produced, appropriated, and distributed. Class processes theorized by Marx and Resnick and Wolff include slave, feudal, capitalist, independent (ancient), and communal.

Community Enterprise

A market- or nonmarket-oriented economic organization concerned to improve community well-being.

Theoretical proposition that economies are intrinsically heterogeneous spaces composed of multiple class processes, mechanisms of exchange, forms of labor and remuneration, finance, and ownership.

A representation of economy as radically heterogeneous.

Theory that discourse participates in constituting the reality it purports to represent.Read more

Economies, Alternative

S. Healy, in International Encyclopedia of Human Geography, 2009

St. Martin and other members of the Community Economies Collective explore the alternative economy as a space of experimentation and difference through a research process that involves them collaboratively with people in place. Far from being idealist, the performative dimension of these action research projects makes use of what already exists, hidden in plain sight, in order to develop political, ethical, and organizational potential. The performative theory of economic difference is not blind to the realities of power, but emphasizes the power of representation and research.

The examples of Collective Copies, the ADP, and community-based fisheries management suggest that the future of alternative economies research within economic geography might revolve around reconceptualizing research as a process of performatively enacting community economies. Activist researchers could engage in disseminating and replicating such experiments in forming community economies, recognizing the powerful role these efforts might play in demonstrating how another economy might be possible.

Ironically, we might turn to the success of the neoliberal project itself for inspiration. As David Harvey points out, the basic tenets of neoliberalism articulated by Friedrich Hayek operated on the margins of economic orthodoxy for decades until the economic crisis of the 1970s gave proponents an opportunity to widely disseminate them. In the same way, perhaps identifying alternative economic practices, conceived as part of a larger field of economic difference, might become a central part of an activist research agenda for economic geographers. Nearly 40 years after the economic crisis that propelled neoliberalism into a position of discursive dominance, it is neoliberalism that is now widely perceived to be in crisis. The flat rejection of export-oriented development and state devolution in Latin America must be seen in the larger context of the failure of the capitalist development project as a whole. When this failure is combined with a deepening awareness of global environmental contradictions, we may find ourselves in an ideal context in which to engage in a performative scholarship and politics of alternative economic development. The expanding presence of the World Social Forum and national forums like the USSF cannot only be read as reflecting a tangible hunger for alternative economies but as a practical context for activists and activist scholars to engage in experimentation and dissemination.

Given the widespread recognition of the failure of development-as-usual and the ubiquity of alternative economic practices foregrounded in the theory of economic difference, the formation of community economies becomes a process that is potentially global in scale while being particular and local in practice. This approach to constructing economic alternatives offers no guarantees; it simply foregrounds possibilities, with the understanding that a wider sense of possibility is a first step toward enacting alternative economies. It is the connection between a performative concept of knowledge, an ontology of economic difference, and a transformative politics of research that will define this area of study and its promise in the future.Read more

Alternative Economies

Stephen Healy, in International Encyclopedia of Human Geography (Second Edition), 2020

Diverse economies researchers explore the economy as a space of experimentation and difference through a research process that involves them collaborative engagement with people in place. Far from being idealist, the performative dimension of these action research projects makes use of what already exists, hidden in plain sight, in order to develop political, ethical, and organizational potential. The performative theory of economic difference is not blind to the realities of power but emphasizes the power of representation and research in a context where all economies are “alternative”—continuously and differentially (re)enacted.

The examples of Collective Copies, community-based fisheries management, and emergent solidarity economies suggest that the future of alternative economies research within economic geography might revolve around reconceptualizing research as a process of performatively enacting more-than-capitalist economies. Activist researchers could engage in disseminating and replicating such experiments in forming community economies, recognizing the powerful role these efforts might play in demonstrating how another economy might be possible.

Ironically, we might turn to the success of the neoliberal project itself for inspiration. As David Harvey points out, the basic tenets of neoliberalism articulated by Friedrich Hayek operated on the margins of economic orthodoxy for decades until the economic crisis of the 1970s gave proponents an opportunity to widely disseminate them. In the same way, perhaps identifying alternative economic practices, conceived as part of a larger field of economic difference, might become a central part of an activist research agenda for economic geographers. Nearly 40 years after the economic crisis that propelled neoliberalism into a position of discursive dominance, it is neoliberalism that is now understood to be in crisis or terminal decline. When this failure is combined with a deepening awareness of global environmental contradictions, we may find ourselves in an ideal context in which to engage in a performative scholarship and politics of alternative economic development. The expanding presence of social movements interested in other economies as crucial to building other worlds cannot only be read as reflecting a tangible hunger for alternative economies but as a practical context for activists and activist scholars to engage in experimentation and dissemination.Read more

Economies, Alternative

S. Healy, in International Encyclopedia of Human Geography, 2009

Contemporary economic geography has seen a theoretical centering of the relationship among neoliberal governance, economic globalization, and capitalist development. The question within this research program is whether to see neoliberal capitalism as a single force defined by its regularities, or as a referent that describes a variety of relations between the state and the economy (see Harvey’s A Brief History of Neoliberalism). Against the backdrop of this larger conversation about neoliberal capitalism, a small but growing number of geographers have turned their attention to a variety of economic activities and sites that can be described as alternative in one of two ways. In the first approach, the alternative economy is simply imagined to be something other than a presumptively dominant capitalism and its associated systems of governance. The term ‘alternative economies’ describes an array of processes of production, ownership, labor, exchange, and consumption that differ from those of the mainstream economy. A second understanding of the alternative economy coalesces around an epistemic break which posits the economy as an always already and intrinsically heterogeneous space. This second approach not only represents the economy as a field of difference but possesses the potential to reconfigure scholarly research within economic geography.

While there has been considerable excitement around the idea of alternative economies, and especially noncapitalist economic activity, the alternative economy remains a marginal concern because of the underlying and frequently unspoken spatial ontology that governs its academic (and popular) representation. In many representations, alternative is synonymous with self-consciously intentional efforts undertaken on a local scale. This association renders what it describes as peripheral and relatively powerless, vulnerable to cooptation or even state repression. From the outset the alternative economy is seen as socially insignificant and thus unworthy of scholarly attention. What is required to combat this double marginality is a theoretical framework that diverges from the conception of the alternative economy as local and intentional. The first step in developing such a framework is to recognize that the marginality of the alternative economy comes from defining something as alternative in the first place. The second step is to produce an ontology of economic difference that highlights the ubiquity (in place) of nonmarket and noncapitalist practices alongside the variety of capitalist forms.Read more

Anthropocene Economics and Design: Heterodox Economics for Design Transitions

Joanna Boehnert, in She Ji: The Journal of Design, Economics, and Innovation, 2019

Heterodox economics responds to global challenges with theory and practical proposals that can be activated with design methods. It reveals the limitations of neoclassical and neoliberal economics and develops a basis for redirected, distributive, regenerative economies. The version of Anthropocene economics described in this paper draws on ecological, feminist, and Marxist economics with their explorations of diverse economies in the commons, the household, and the state. These alternative economies open space for incorporating and valuing currently undervalued work, including provisioning ecosystem services and the labor of marginalized majority populations. Economists, design theorists, anthropologists, and others investigating the intersection of economic value and social values have exposed the ways that economic processes and structures colonize social and environmental values, systemically de-prioritizing environmental imperatives. Economic processes are driven by what institutional structures are designed to value, and these system structures then strongly influence social values and even affect human subjectivity. I have argued that ecologically viable and socially just futures depend on redirecting the systems that determine what is designed. Design must help build economies that will work with, rather than against, ecological circumstances. Sustainable futures depends on a redirection of design practice, design economies, and broader economic systems. It should be evident that redesigning economic processes and structures is a social and political problem—not a technocratic one. Design—a social practice accustomed to inciting human desire and negotiating subjectivities—is poised to enable redirected, regenerative, and distributive economies on a variety of scales in an infinite number of ways. Considering evidence provided by climate and other environmental scientists on the trajectory of our current economic system, its transformation is a generational imperative that must not be shirked.Read more
