Unavailability Of Classic Titles Is "Holding Game Culture Back", Says Platinum's Hideki Kamiya

Games should be available to "everyone who wants to play them"

The way we play and consume classic video games has become a hot topic of late, thanks largely to some rather shady practices being employed by collectors to boost the value of certain titles.

While some people are keen to increase the value of their collection while it sits on the shelf, those of us who simply want to play and enjoy video games are losing out ‚Äì because, in a lot of cases, the reason retro games are worth so much is down to the fact that there's literally no other means of playing a certain game other than in its original form.

VGC posed this question to PlatinumGames' Hideki Kamiya, an avid retro gamer and collector. He says that he understands the appeal of getting a particular physical title in the best possible condition, but laments that people who simply want to play games are often missing out:

As a collector myself, I understand the lure of wanting to have that game in the sealed package. People want the value of that package and not necessarily of the game itself. But as a fan, it‚Äôs a problem if somebody wants to play a game but they can‚Äôt get it because it‚Äôs being traded in these ridiculous marketplaces.

He had particularly stern words to say about those companies which own the IP to certain desirable games but don't make them available digitally at a reasonable price:

And the responsibility for keeping those games available belongs to the company that owns the IP. If people want to play a classic game and they can‚Äôt, because it‚Äôs not available on new platforms and can‚Äôt be found in its original form either, that‚Äôs like a threat‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs holding game culture back. The people who own the rights to these games should be actively making moves to preserve game culture and making games available to everyone who wants to play them.

Ironically, Nintendo ‚Äì one of Platinum's most regular clients ‚Äì is particularly bad at this. Take Metroid Fusion as an example; with Metroid Dread on the way, interest in the series has gone through the roof and loose cartridges are now fetching handsome prices online, mainly because it's not (currently) possible to play the game on Nintendo's most recent system, the Switch (it is, however, available on the Wii U Virtual Console).

There are numerous other first-party Nintendo games that are effectively "out of print" right now. Nintendo's strategy is usually to re-release or remaster these games and sell them at a premium price (as it did with Zelda: Skyward Sword HD and Super Mario 3D All-Stars), but this often means that there's no way to play classic Nintendo titles unless you either stump up the cash to buy the original hardware and the game, or you emulate them on a PC or other platform ‚Äì especially as the Virtual Console is no longer a thing on Switch and has been replaced by Nintendo Switch Online, which currently offers a rather uneven selection of classic SNES and NES games via a paid subscription.

Hard to believe that scarce availability of retro games, as well as companies neglect (if not refusal) regarding re-release fan favorites (looking at you Nintendo), is pushing people to emulation methods and flash carts ü§îü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Once again, emulation is my best friend

Honey, wake up! It's time to ***** all over the lacklustre Switch Online offerings again!

The number of times this gets brought up, yet nothing ever gets done about it... Hopefully the GB/GBA rumours are true. But I doubt it at this point

This is why I like the Virtual Console system that the PS3, Vita, Wii, Wii U and the 3DS use. A great chance to play older games.

There is some truth to what he says, although I fear the message is being warped into one that states that all classic games must be available on the latest platforms no questions asked. Kind of like the PS4-PS5 free upgrade crowd. For costly titles not available in any cheap form though, I totally agree.

I also agree with the Metroid Fusion example as it seems prices on eBay have shot up crazy (I remember cartridge alone for ¬£15-20). Also 2nd hand Wii U console prices is another barrier to the VC option.

Yeah, it's getting ridiculous, for instance one of my kids asked me to play my Metroid Gameboy advance cartridges but since I fear he my brake them I thought why not buy some more? Off I go to look for them online only to find they are like 100 dollars each. (I still don't know if I will buy those games again but I let him play my cartridges cause you know, that's what games are made for)üôÇ

Kamiya gets it. Most of us just want to play games. Collecting is fun but thats just not what's important. I want to get into MvC2. How am I supposed to do that legally?

@CharlieGirl I just bought my first flash cart last month. It, well, hasn't arrived yet, which is causing me more and more anxiety as the days go by, so I have nothing to say about it yet, but I bought one.

@EriXz Just invest in a flash cart. Everdrive is a popular option.

@EriXz A family friend once passed their metroid prime onto me, and when I told them how much they were going for he said "you shouldn't have told me that."

Respect for letting your kids play

Games of certain IP do stand out as missing amongst all other retro titles made available. It would be nice to have a Turtles collection on par with Konami‚Äôs Castlevania collection which could also feature games from the same consoles. Gameboy, NES, SNES etc.

Some of the classics are based on Disney IP or other TV / films. It would be good to see more of these games available to buy. Surely it would only benefit the companies associated with them.

I agree. That's why I emulate all of my old systems.

Games are made to be played. Collecting has gotten absolutely out of hand and it‚Äôs taking the fun out of the hobby. I‚Äôm not sure anybody should really feel that bad about emulating a game that you can only buy for massively inflated prices.

@nessisonett Collectors have become hoarders, and it sucks all the fun out for casual hobbyists. It's sad that hoarders forget these are GAMES meant to be played for fun.

Let's face it, Nintendo had to give virtual console a generation rest, with a sub type thing, so they can come out the heroes and sell us all those retro games again on the next system.

Oddly enough I finally started playing Fire Emblem: Shadow of the Dragon last night. I'm really enjoying it and the fact that it's a pretty hard Fire Emblem game. The only reason I got it was cause I had some gold coin credit and didn't want to miss out as a Fire Emblem fan. I was going to tell a mate to get it if he fancied a bit of old school strategy. Can't can he, as it was a limited timed release. Bloomin' rotten that is, no need for it.

This is the reason I download games that are not easily available to purchase digitally. I have downloaded many abandoned ware games that companies don't releases digitally. GoG has been great in this instance. They could do more but what they have done is fantastic. This is why when going forward companies need to be able to allow backwards compatibility for all games. Even if they didn't allow it physically allow it for all digital games.

Everdrives and ODEs are for people who want to play original hardware. a one-time investment and you're done. Also emulators. Paying these prices for retro games is stupid at this point

Companies have no "responsibility" to make classic games available. Please stop with the entitlement nonsense. Products of every stripe run their course and usually are not revived. With each of the past three console generations, Nintendo has made hundreds of retro games available at affordable (I said "affordable") prices. If someone really, really, really wants to play a game, there are ways to play that game. Nobody's rights are being violated because some GBA game is scarce or some 1960s sitcom isn't available on demand or some rare, speed-fueled Elvis Presley 45-rpm vinyl is out of circulation. I want a 1925 Studebaker for Friday night joy-riding with Ms. Spear, but I'll just have to live without it. Sorry for the rant, but a company's "responsibility" is to produce a useful product without poisoning people, not to ensure that every last video game ever made is on the current console's menu.

@Burning_Spear I can see your point of view but if companies see it that way then companies shouldn't complain about people downloading roms of their old games that are not available to purchase online digitally.

@Burning_Spear @Burning_Spear Burning Spear this is the dumbest thing I've ever read. I want to play Banjo Kazooie, but it costs like 50 dollars used and I don't have a N64. My brother won't let me use his copy because I erased the save file by accident. So I have to pay like 300 dollars to buy a used N64 with Banjo? And then when I beat the game I have to sell it all back? These games should all be free on Switch online. It takes no effort to port these games, but Nintendo has an anti-consumer attitude about selling everything and making us wait for it.

While i understand that the license-situation surrounding many titles is complicated, the IP-holder is involved, the developer (Or the company who bought up the developer), and so on, but so many games are for the average person outright unattainable right now.

There's also the battery-factor, save data on cartridges will be at risk due to batteries dying, which can also cause trouble, so re-releases on modern hardware would be awesome, people are plenty willing to pay for those games, just not inflated collector prices.

I got a flash cart for my GBA last year, excellent investment, i can put stacks of games (With a market value of "I'm happy not knowing") on there, save data is secure, i can play romhacks and all.

It's not like i'm being literally forced (I can always not play those games), but face it, if i want to play old games and i don't own them yet (I never got rid of my old systems and games), it's a lot more affordable.

Yeah, I've no qualms about using emulators as long as that continues being the case.

And I've always been supporting the official re-releases when it comes to titles that interest me.

@Minecraft_Master " It takes no effort to port these games" It isn't as easy as you think it is.

Meanwhile, people make fun of Skyrim for being available in almost every console for the last 2-3 generations

I have learnt something. If the retro games are unbuyable due to inflated price, i decided to let them go. Just let them go, play other games with affordable price and forget those inflated price retro games. I don't have to taste every single retro games to be called a gamer. I will not thinking about emulating the games illegally since i have decided to become original gamer, playing the games with actual hardwares and softwares without modding.

@Burning_Spear Sucking up to billion dollar companies won't make them your friend.

@CharlieGirl is that what a repro cartridge is? Cuz I found fusion and zero mission for like 20 bucks and the guy said those were repro cartridges, he told me they work just the same but one was missing the label

"And the responsibility for keeping those games available" Come on, that's silly. Nobody has a "responsibility" to keep games available. Nobody has some ephemeral duty to spend their own money bringing these games on to modern platforms or in remakes or on new hardware that plays classic games.

There is money out there to be made for old games.... IF there is the demand for them. Not every game has enough demand to justify the expense of doing so. The vast majority of them don't. Nobody should be expected to lose money just to bring these games up for the few people who are interested.

And just because a game has a high resale price on the second-hand market doesn't NECESSARILY mean there would be the demand to actually buy it to PLAY. Much of the price is for pure speculation, and the person who would pay $300 for Game X because they suspect it'll be worth $400 in a year is not likely to pay $50 for Game X Remastered.

@CharlieGirl I'm not pandering to big companies but instead criticizing the attitude of, "I want, so I get ... and free."

@CharlieGirl I have to say you're wrong here - as a collector, I only track down old games that I genuinely will play. I don't believe in keeping them factory sealed as a means of investment, I know people do that, but it doesn't mean you have to attack everyone who's hobby is collecting games. Also, what's the likelihood of "casual hobbyists" wanting go back and play old GBA games, for example. I'd imagine casual players would only be interested in modern systems and available games rather than sitting out in the sun with Boktai.

@Gidorah thank you!! I mean, they are going to lose me once Dread comes out, so they better know what game I'm going to be investing my time on

@Burning_Spear Yeah I hardly viewed your comment as 'sucking up'. People just don't like it when you have a different opinion from them. And I fully agree with you! I'd love it if Terranigma and Panzer Dragoon Saga and Baten Kaitos Origins were available digitally on my Switch, but whit ye gonna do eh?

@EriXz Not exactly! Repro carts are literally reproduction carts - they have a copy of the game installed to them, designed to run (nearly) flawlessly on original hardware.

A flash cart is similar, because you can put it in your original system of choice (Game Boy, Super NES, etc), but to play games you need to put an SD card inside. An SD card one could fill up with games downloaded from the internet, if they so chose üòâ

@FantasiaWHT "Not every game has enough demand to justify the expense of doing so. The vast majority of them don't. Nobody should be expected to lose money just to bring these games up for the few people who are interested."

Agreed. Go to a retro-gaming store and ask the owner about his or her winter home in Aruba. The person will laugh at you. Those stores aren't awash in profits, and it's because retro games are largely a niche thing once you get past the classics. The so-called "demand" for the obscure games is really just one or two people wanting one game, one or two people wanting another, and on and on ... there's little profit to be found in a large-scale reproduction of back catalogues.

Oh, I think I understand what Hideki Kamiya is saying... We're going to get Mad World on the Switch, right?!

@CharlieGirl oh, this is very interesting to me, maybe I should investigate further into this fascinating topic. Thanks for the heads up üôÇ

@Burning_Spear @PessitheMystic

From the perspective of "corporate products," you're both right. From the perspective of culture and understanding the medium, not being able to access the classics is an immense loss. That is what Kamiya is referring to. It goes beyond "entitlement." My favorite film is from 1939; my favorite book is from the 19th century. I sure am glad both were preserved for posterity.

This is a major issue with console gaming. Each game is tied to the console it came out on and does not carry over to the next console.

This is why I have moved over to PC gaming

Nintendo should create a retro games division to bring back old games that can be emulated on Switch and future Nintendo consoles, via Virtual Console but linked not to one platform but to your account so that you can move your library with you to the Switch 2. I would be more than happy to double dip just for the convenience of not having to plug my SNES/N64/Gamecube in. Having my library of Nintendo games fragmented on so many different systems is a shame.

@Beaucine Hey, I'm on the side of videogame preservation here too, I think it's a damn shame that some of the titles I mentioned above are not widely available. Videogames are a different beast to movies though - remember when Sony's own Jim Ryan said "who would want to play this" when referring to old games?

If your favourite film is from 1939 (I'm gonna guess Wizard of Oz or Gone with Wind here, for arguments sake), those are 2 massively beloved cultural landmarks of cinema, which could perhaps be the equivalent of Super Mario Bros. in the videogame world? The point I'm making is that not all movies from 1939 are preserved and distributed on Bluray or whatever nowadays, only real significant titles will make the cut. Same goes for games unfortunately.

Would it be nice to have easy cheap legal way to access to all games ever sure. Is it feasible not really. Rights expiry, some games aren't profitable and others aren't good enough to bother. Companies don't have to do anything like that's silly trying to make it a responsibility or right. It would be nice if the big 3 made better efforts though but then retro gaming isn't for the mass market and profit drives all companies. Are collectors ruining it well like they are one preserving games that probably be binned if no one did . If they were incredible cheap wouldn't have much people or stores selling them. Evaluation and roms are options I'm not going judge people for using them, like it's way more feasible and I'm not going scream at companies taking down as they are the rights holders. It's just the dance that is emulation.

@Old-Red this is the worst thing. In 06 being able to download so many games without resorting to emulators. And seeing this happen on the 360 and PS3 was great. Obviously some games wouldn't come out and I bought so many.

But seeing these games become unavailable on switch and to get just a fraction of them on Switch but only if you pay for a subscription is an insult. I spent around 200 pounds on wii and wii u virtual console games and to be expected to keep spending to get them again is a complete rip off and shows a complete lack of gratitude for what I spent from 06 to 14. I have a wii u with those games but knowing if it brakes down it could all be lost isn't right. Microsoft allow you to move 360 downloads over new consoles. It's awful that Nintendo expect you to pay again, and again.

@Boldfoxrd @Boldfoxrd Boldfoxrd, I agree. If I buy a game once I should get it for free or maybe a dollar or two every time it is re-released. Why should I be forced to keep buying it?

This is why I'm glad there's such an active focus on emulation in fan communities. I'm happy to buy re-releases and ports as they come out, but if a company can't be bothered to bring their stuff forward I have no problem downloading the ROMs and playing them on my PC.

The way I see it, old games will always be available one way or another, because there's such a passionate following around games. Given that, companies have the option of either capitalizing on it by offering up their own legitimate re-releases, or losing out on all that money while a modest contingent of the interested audience just handles it themselves.

Or, you could take Nintendo's approach, which is to offer up next to no legitimate ways to access the back catalog while wasting company resources in a hopeless battle to remove ROMs from the internet. I think they'd be a lot more successful if they stopped paying lawyers to C&D ROM sites and instead put that money towards building out a comprehensive base of their legacy content for a reasonable price. Their work with the SNES and NES apps is a decent start, but there's a lot more room to progress there.

Hideki Kamiya is a smart dude.

It's time for Nintendo to make their own Gamepass like service and spend some actually money to get third parties on board.

Sure, I'm aware of the logistical and economic realities of it all. Not everything is going to survive. But it's important to have this conversation, because publishers and developers aren't always going to care unless we do. Part of the issue, really, is that games ‚Äî and especially console games ‚Äî aren't always made to last. There's no unified format for storage and preservation. Frank Cifaldi has an interesting talk about this from GDC 2016: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLWY7fCXUwE. With film, what you often have is infrastructure in place so that, once a film is digitalized, it can be distributed in different formats. (It's not always as easy as all that, of course. Especially with very old movies.) With videogames, that's not usually the case, because so many games are tethered to specific hardware. That drives up preservation costs in the future, because no plan was made in the present. The emulation scene, of course, partly gets around that, but it's not ideal.

The 1939 movie in question is The Rules of the Game. It's admittedly canonical, one of the most respected French films of all time, but not exactly The Wizard of Oz in terms of commercial prospects.

Good thing they are Indeed available to everyone, it's only a matter to search them well! If Batman Returns (SNES) will never be available on modern platform officially, there are other ways...

I wholeheartedly agree with what he‚Äôs saying. If companies like Nintendo, Sega, Namco, and Konami aren‚Äôt going to make their games readily available, there is NO reason we shouldn‚Äôt emulate them.

Collect only what you really really want - and for everything else there are Everdrives, GCVideo, MiSTer, flashcards, etc.

I‚Äôm not convinced that game collecting is out of hand, as users above seem to think. Yes, some titles are going for ridiculous prices, but an overwhelming majority of other titles are still being sold for very fair deals. This is especially true if you import them from Japan. My copy of Mario 4 (Super Mario World) cost me only $7. I got Super C, Zelda 1+2, and Dragon Warrior for $12-$25 each, depending on the title.

The only games that are outrageously priced are games that were in rare print, or sealed games/CIB games.

And of course, emulation has solved this problem, once and for all. Emulation‚Äôs exceptional quality was the reason I didn‚Äôt have any problem giving my collection away to a friend.

Agreed, there are so many classic games I want to play but they are priced too high for me to want to take the plunge, I know it's simple supply and demand but it discourages me from playing games from past generations.

@Dpishere Import Japanese versions. Mega Man X3 is nearly $300, but Rock Man X3 is usually around $20 if you buy from a Japanese seller, and it‚Äôs an identical game in every way, save for the story portions being different languages. Many, many, many classic games can be bought for a fraction of a new Switch game.

@Yorumi Exactly. There should be some timeframe on games that have been abandoned completely. That way a different company can continue the legacy, if they wanted.

@BloodNinja True you can get the Japanese versions, I don't know though, something about having the American version appeals alot more to me, and I would need a Super Famicom as well. There are some GameCube games I want to play but they are obscene prices, and those games tend to be more text heavy than Super NES games so a Japanese version won't do most of the time.

Sorry for people who didn't buy a Wii U or sold theirs, but Metroid Fusion is available right now on the Wii U eShop. It's less than $10. Play it in handheld mode or on the TV. Nintendo isn't keeping it from the general public, and hoarders can't stop it from being on the eShop.

Anyone could have bought this game if they owned the consoles that were readily available for nearly 20 years, but now Nintendo is supposed to release a cheap version? I'm not following this line of thought. If someone is REALLY into retro games, go buy a Wii U on eBay. You can get one for less than a hundred dollars. The eShop offers a huge array of affordably priced retro games. If you don't want to do this, then it's your choice, of course. No harm or shame. But then the question is: Are you into retro games, or do you just want the games of your choice cheap or free?

This is why i get so mad when Nintendo attacks another ROM site. If Nintendo made the content available by legal means people would take that avenue. But at least 95% of Nintendo library just isn't available any other way.

I think NL and lots of other people are working on that that is you say something enough that it will eventually become true.

You keep running these articles to make yourselves feel better, Nintendo and others will still be there to stop people making money off their backs!

@earthinheritor It's a long explanation and not worth the can of worms it opens, but the short answer is that it's difficult from a legal standpoint for Nintendo to pursue legal action against the true pirates if it's turning a blind eye toward ROM sites. Not saying it's right, just explaining why Nintendo behaves this way.

I agree with a lot of Kamiya's point. It has definitely led to inflated prices for certain titles. Chrono Trigger (SNES/DS both expensive), and Pokemon Gen 4 and Gen 5 (easily $120 - $200 for complete copies) immediately come to my mind but there are countless others. The original copies of these games would probably still command a premium, but probably not quite as much as they do now.

@Dpishere All you need to do to your SNES is open it up, and clip two pieces of plastic off and you can play Japanese games on it. Very, very easy mod, can be done with an exactoknife. There are two plastic tabs on either side of the cartridge slot that prevent Japanese games from being inserted. Once removed, you can play Japanese region carts on it.

NES is a more complicated affair, since you need to find a specific version of Gyromite that has an adaptor inside it, remove the adaptor and place it into an empty NES cart with with a famicom game inserted into the adaptor. But, NES and Famicom games are fairly similarly priced.

Anyway, don't let these articles mislead you. Yes, a sealed copy of Mario 1 is going for a fortune, but if you actually look on eBay I think you'll be surprised how cheap the majority of games are, and if all you really want to do is play them there are many that are playable regardless of language differences, since the gameplay is the important part.

Just make sure that what you are buying is authentic, and not a reproduction. Do research before you decide to get into collecting, if you ever do.

@Yorumi Indeed. There needs to be a more elegant solution for this, if companies really want to take a stab at emulation.

Whatever device you are reading this on, probably plays old roms. Problem solved.

It seems like the real problem here is that games are not available in the exact format you want to play them in.

It's like sitting in traffic complaining about traffic. I'm not traffic, you say, because my trip is important. All these other people are in my way. Taking the train is immoral and all these people are ruining driver culture.

Game culture is fine. Retro games are preserved and playable for free.

People need to understand that their "principled" anti-piracy position is not a virtue. These corporations refuse to sell you their old games and our laws regarding the public domain (in the U.S.) are a twisted joke. What was originally a 28 year time-span where the state would protect your copyright has ballooned to nearly 100 years. Every tax-payer is paying to protect these corporate interests due to lobbying on their behalf.

Metroid fusion was released in the Wii U. It is not Nintendo‚Äôs fault people didn‚Äôt buy a WiiU and play it. Although I agree all games should be made available digitally at least that is a very bad example and shows how much this journalist actually knows and how much research was put in before making that comment.

Tell second hand sellers to stop inflating prices and then everyone can have games.

I disagree. The owners of these IPs have every right to do whatever they want with their IPs and if they want to do nothing with the historical titles from said IPs then that‚Äôs their prerogative. No gamer is entitled to x game being re-released/remastered etc. Gamers shouldn‚Äôt act in this way IMO.

@BloodNinja Thanks for the tips they are appreciated.

@Yorumi Thank you for the advice, I had forgotten that about the Super NES.

We all know Metroid Fusion is going to be a free unlock with Metroid Dread. Right? Right?

@mattmanvsuperman It really depends on which titles you are referring to. 3rd parties are a law unto themselves but it‚Äôs my understanding all platform holders had a retro gaming service right up to last gen. Again, I feel some are acting extremely entitled, whilst the game companies don‚Äôt ‚Äúowe us‚Äù these retro titles people are clamouring for.

@Chibi Sure, they have every right to do what they want. I'm not proposing any kind of law that would force them to re-release games. On the other hand we have no duty to wait for them or abstain from playing classic titles either. We will have those experiences and they can be a part of it and profit from it or not.

@Chibi Gamers want to play good games, if those games aren't officially available they would find some other ways to play them...

Unfortunately there's a growing mentality of "Who cares about old games? Just play new stuff". Probably younger people that never experienced those old classics and are missing out on how amazingly they still hold up today.

Sealed and sealed / graded folks just have a slabbed box of wealth, they don't care if it's a game, comic, card, just that it's worth money.

My Virtual Console: Internet Archives

@Gidorah MvC2 for Original Xbox may be the cheapest option, unless you want the DC version. It was de-listed on PSN and Live Arcade a long time ago.

Hopefully Hideki had Konami and their hoarding of Hudson Soft in mind. What a waste of an IP catalogue. Konami barely gets much of their own back catalogue out

@Burning_Spear some rare Elvis 45 rpm vinyl may be out of circulation, but I guarantee you the actual songs that were on that 45 are available to buy digitally or stream via Spotify, Apple Music, etc. Do you not see the difference? That's why your Studebaker example is farcical and irrelevant. We're not talking about physical goods.

And we know Nintendo‚Äôs problem: they‚Äôre drip feeders in a desert of their own making. Every drop can have a high price and maximum demand. And they‚Äôve only gotten less ‚Äúgenerous‚Äù since Wii VC

@Chibi It's not that we feel owed, that's ridiculous. We want to PAY for these things on modern hardware, at reasonable prices. That wouldn't mean that anyone is being entitled, since there is a FAIR and REASONABLE exchange between two or more parties. Yikes man.

It is weird to be against piracy on the one hand and also think property owners have a responsibility to provide access to their IP. I mean, it's not a contradiction but it's super selective. Which is why I find this kind of moralizing dubious.

@Chibi Actually, they do have a right to access because games are now culture. If games want to be taken seriously as culture and art, then they need to be available, just as the works of Shakespeare, Michelangelo, Dostoyevsky, Chopin, the Beatles, Mark Twain, etc. are available. No one is asking for freebies. I will happily pay for this stuff. All people are asking for is ACCESS to these games. A lot of PC Game companies do this as you can find tons of old Origin, Sierra, Interplay, Microprose, and LucasArts games on GOG.com, so there is a precedent.

If a company keeps this stuff locked away in a vault, then they should not be allowed to be considered art or part of culture, and that includes Nintendo.

"They should not be allowed to be considered art or part of culture" is truly one of the most baffling things I have ever read on this site.

The idea that "they [games] should not be allowed [anything]" requires someone to allow it. Who is it that is not allowing games to be considered art or culture? What authority do they have? Who gives them that authority? Since games are inanimate objects they are not advocating for themselves to be consider art. So who wants them to be considered art or culture?

@Purgatorium The history of art is the history of the world, going all the way back to Ancient Egypt or Sumer or even earlier to the cave paintings at Lascaux. We have these cultural touchstones in order to understand the world we live in. Imagine being unable to teach someone about Shakespeare or Beethoven, or even Alfred Hitchcock, because their work was simply and completely inaccessible. That's what companies like Nintendo are doing. It's Nintendo that is removing themselves from the cultural conversation. They have decided to not be available and so should not be considered when we discuss what is actually culturally important or relevant.

Let me put it another way. Imagine that I‚Äôm talking to someone about some side-scrolling platformer I‚Äôm really into, like "Hollow Knight" or "Dead Cells" or something, and I‚Äôm going on and on about stuff I like about the games. The person I‚Äôm talking to responds with, ‚Äúwell in 'Metroid Fusion' you could blah, blah, blah this, that, and the other.‚Äù It would have no meaning for me, because there is no way for me to go and try the game to see what they‚Äôre talking about.

Contrast this with a lot of PC Games. I could be telling someone about "Ultima 6," "The Secret of Monkey Island," the original "Fallout," or "System Shock," and they can actually go and buy the damn games and play them to see what I‚Äôm talking about.

So, you may have some great memories of old Nintendo Games, but if people can‚Äôt experience them now then they are irrelevant to any conversation. They might as well not exist.

I'm sorry, but Nintendo's historical cultural status is not being diminished by the limited availability of Metroid Fusion. I can understand and appreciate Coca-Cola's place in Americana without having ever sipped a Diet Coke or one of the many variants the company has marketed, and I can understand the Beatles' place in culture without having listened to every last bootleg recording. It would be great to be able to easily play every video game ever, but we don't need that luxury to be able to get the full cultural experience. How many of us have even played 10 percent of the available games?

"there's literally no other means of playing a certain game other than in its original form."

Uhh if have to disagree with that. Keep fighting the good fight, keepers of the roms.

Not a very difficult problem to overcome, unless you're an anti-emulation snob.

Not sure what all the fuss is about. There are good options for playing almost all retro games. Many mentioned above.

@CazSonOfCaz That doesn't really have anything to do with what I'm talking about. In your reply I suppose you're saying the companies like Nintendo are preventing their work from being a part our culture by limiting access to their work. What I was responding to was the idea that their work "should not be allowed to be considered art or part of culture."

I prefer playing games on authentic hardware with the original software. Something is lost with emulation. It just doesn't feel the same. I can't blame those who take that route, but there's something about digging though my collection to find a cart or disc, putting it in the system, and instantly booting it up and playing with an original controller. I don't have to mess with emulator settings or worry about input lag.

Retro games, like blurays/DVDs and CDs, are an investment in my future entertainment. No internet connection, updates, or compatibility issues to worry about.

With all of that said, I do appreciate official rereleases, as long as they're handled well.

Gaming culture has all but taken over and replaced any remnant of real culture. Perhaps a little bit of holding back is in order?

I whole heartedly agree that more legacy titles should be available.

I just don't agree with the entitled nonsense people spout where they act as though we are owed access to the games and if they wont sell it at a reasonable price, then we can pirate the whole library from that platform and save it to our PC.

I have a couple thousand retro games in my collection and I thankfully got 90% of my holy grails before the retro game rush during the lockdowns. I visited all the retro stores in my area and nearly puked at the insane prices they're commanding because Billy Bob was bored and decided to buy an SNES and a copy of Super Mario Kart. Then 20 more Billy Bobs came in and did the same thing, now they are just sitting in a closet collecting dust and we have to wait for those systems to cycle back in. This was explained to me buy a store owner. There are also some people selling off entire collections to make ends meet and this could drive prices down soon.

Right now a CIB SNES runs nearly $300 when just 18 months ago they were maybe $100-150. A loose, yellow, and cracked SNES is around $150 now. Many of my own games have surged in value over the last couple of years and I had to increase my insurance premium on them because of it.

@HexagonSun 100% feel the same. I have a couple thousand games in my collection and I take great care of my systems and even modded some of my handhelds to have better screens and sound so I can enjoy them more on the regular. I daily drive a GBA that has a new screen and sound board and it's not the same as even emulating it on my PSP or Vita. Sadly, this is something that is lost with time and I feel anyone under 25 right now wouldn't appreciate this or could care less. They just don't understand the feeling of a physical disc, memory card, accessory, rumble pack etc. The sound of the disc drive scanning way in the middle of the night, and even just knowing what was on the disc/cart is what you got and there were no patches unless it was re-released. Even handhelds are being considered retro with everyone emulating PSP games even which is crazy. I don't blame them though, things get lost with time and thankfully there are still people like this in the newer generations who are curious and appreciate the past. I get being a purist is expensive. I don't even bother with CRTs for 90's consoles and just mod them and get high quality cables and use a retrotink to make them look great on newer TVs. Even that's expensive to do. My component Saturn cables alone were $80.

Classic games are available. You just have to know where to look (wink wink, nudge nudge).
