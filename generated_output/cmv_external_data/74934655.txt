Welcome to the official X-Men subreddit. The home of all things X-Men on reddit, be it comic books, film, television, gaming or any other medium that Marvel's mutants have inspired people over the last half-century.

Why are mutants hated and feared, but other superpowered beings such as the avengers and the fantastic four respected and accepted by most of the general public?

It’s almost like prejudices don’t have to actually have any basis in logic or reason, because they’re irrational, illogical reasons to hate peoples based on arbitrary classification and division.

I know it's been two years since you posted this comment, but I just felt the need to give you some form of praise as well as gratitude!! This comment, although technically not what the OP really asked for, is without a doubt the correct answer. Thank you, good sir and/or madam, and/or they/them.

This is the best answer.

This is a cop-out. Even if it doesn’t make sense to US, the person doing the prejudicing always has some sort of internal logic. It’s valid to question what that logic is.

Facts. It's a terrible answer.

Humans fear what they don't understand, or something that is stronger than them. They aren't experiments or gods or people in high tech suits, they are humans with natural enhancements, as in, they ain't human human. Stronger than humans

Plus like what another commentator said, these stronger humans could be anyone, and that's dangerous for the basic human that doesn't have a special mutation

The truest answer I've ever really gotten whenever I've tried calling someone out on their prejudice/bias/whatever is basically just "because", regardless of how big or minor it is. Even if it's just 'the way they were raised' or whatever, prejudice is rarely built on a single, definable moment/event. The irrational, illogical nature of it is usually the extent of the internal logic as feelings can't be controlled or decided, just the actions we perform with them. Unfortunately, we usually trust our feelings and build the reasonings up around them which is how you get chuds pulling the 13% out of their ass. Cop-out or not, I feel like what appears to be destructive genetic sleeper agents is a lot easier to irrationally fear just "because" than people with a different skin color.

but the superheros visually spit in the face of everything they hate. there's a point where you can't outlogic your own ignorance anymore. the only person who hates spiderman is JJJ and he don't get that traction going much. so there's a point where if you hate mutants, you hate ALL superpowered heroes.

It's because mutants can be anyone. They aren't all public facing heroic figures, and even then many of the public facing figures are actively malicious.

No, the little girl down the street might have a Sonic scream that she can't control that could destroy your house or kill your dog. Your friend from school might suddenly develop laser eyes that kill your girlfriend.

Even stillany mutations are less super power, and more grotesque feature, as withany of the back cast of Grant Morrison's X-Men. They might be hard to look at. They might be accidentally dangerous. You don't know where they are or what they want.

It's very different than the avengers. It could be anyone. And it could be very threatening to you

There was a single issue in Ultimate X-Men that had a boy wake up to find himself alone; his house is empty, his neighborhood is abandoned, and nothing is alive anywhere around him. Turns out his mutant power is (I can't remember the exact ability) to atomize everything living thing around him.

That's the fear that I can kind of see people having regarding mutants, untrained teenagers with hidden nukes. Look at any instance of the major players when they first got their powers; Scott blasting through walls, Rogue zapping a boy, Storm destroying an ecosystem. As you said, it could be anyone and that's kind of terrifying to the general public.

Hulk and Juggernaut is more dangerous than the entire mutant species

Yea and they’re both feared your point? The government was chasing Hulk for years and Juggernaut is a damn villain.

Franklin Richards, Gambit, technically Scarlet Witch, Mathew Malloy, Legion....

But most mutants aren't powerful or omega level though? Most mutants have very insignificant mutations/abilities. Only a very small percent is able to cause damage.

That's true, but the public doesn't know that.

It's the same with every other minority group; a black person is arrested for selling drugs, then bigots will point to all black people selling drugs; a trans person decides to detransition and bigots will demand that every trans perfect will change their mind.

Hatred isn't based on reality or sense but on seeing a small sample size and attributing it to the larger community. There's a reason why bigotry is larger in parts of the world or countries where diversity isn't big; a small town in South Dakota might not have many asian people compared to California so to people there, their own real exposure to asians are from the news. To some people in the Marvel Universe, all they hear is "Young boy destroys school with eyes", "Woman traps neighbor in nightmarish hellscape over lawn dispute", and "Mutants found living in sewers", which means they don't know the reality, just the sensational which is why Xavier's whole plan is to normalize mutants, to show that most of them are teachers, gardeners, and IT support.

Sounds like an excuse for racism

That's what the thread was asking for

I mean sure but in one comic a kid literally woke up the power to atomise anyone near him and it was permanently on. So yeah I'd say the fear is kind of justified when anyone can wake up with uncontrollable powers that can level entire cities

Yeah and who knows when a police officer with gun might sleep walk, that's not a problem right. Man mutants are similar as natural stuff. If a lion eats your girlfriend are gonna consider your that lion your enemy and Sue that lion?

I would not doubt there is someone stupid enough to do that.

This thread is 2 years old....

But I might be forever traumatized by lions. I generally today think lions should be weary of them and if I saw one in the neighborhood I would expect something be done about it by the government

The debate will go on for eternity 🤣

More replies More replies

Yeah, people generally don't allow lions into society and don't think they deserve human rights. Most civilized societies also don't allow their police to have weapons willy nilly, and have higher standards for who can become a police officer, and make sure that guns are accounted for and tracked so not just anyone can use them.

Yesterday I saw a video. Police pulled over a guy and asked him to surrender and he did that too. But this guy was recording everything in his phone, police were screaming like put down the phone like he has some bomb. He said they can hand cuff him and he's not doing anything. But they still tased him. And all this was recorded in the same guy's phone

What does that have to do with anything?

Alr but so many random event have given other people powers right, spider-man got bit by a random bug, lizard, sentry and green goblin used an experimental serum on themselves, juggernaut just happened to come across a jewel and got op, hulk survived a nuke and became stronger than gods etc. , so u still have reason to fear these people coz the most random stuff gave them powers and hence any1 cld go thru a freak accident or random even and get powers and may either not be able to control them and get overwhelmed killing many in the process or become a hero or straight-up just a villain even if they can control said powers. Also inhumans who are basically the same as mutants are also born with their powers and just need a catalyst to unlock them (the catalyst being the terragen myst or crystal etc), then why do they not get a similar lvl of hate, hell they barely get any. I find this to be a big plot hole in the comics ngl and it needs more explanation.

Because they are the next stage in human evolution. They are here to replace US. People are scared that their species is coming to an end I suppose.

Which is dumb because they are our children

Pretty much. It boils down to xenophobia

Like, they say that it a lot that "the mutants are coming to replace us!" but that is irrational every new generation "replaces" the previous one. Mutants are mostly born from human parents. Its not like Planet of the Apes where a separate species threatens humanity as the ruler of the world, they are just our own children who happen to have superpowers. They are us. It seems to be a square trying to go in a round hole, the civil rights metaphor doesn't really work

More replies More replies More replies

Because there's a sense that others earned their superpowers. Captain America? War hero! Iron Man? Genius industrialist! Hulk? Well, people are scared shitless of him. Fantastic Four? People had a lot of issues accepting Ben, but again we're talking an astronaut and scientist and his family.

For many of them, like Thing (all FF at times, really) and Hulk, them getting their powers is treated as a tragic accident.

Do you know what we call it if you tell someone the way they were born is a tragic accident? We call it hate.

To be fair Spider-Man isn't widely accepted either, more due to J.J. treating him like total crap.

There are ways to explain it. I just think the X-Books do not acknowledge it sufficiently because it breaks the mutants=race/sexuality/etc minority analogy.

There's rational reasons to hate/fear mutants and not supers.

And even so, we see that people DO fear the supers. Civil War/SHRA events were about that. But anyway here are some reasons:

Supers are a small number and they don't expand at a huge rate. They're not a "population". Mutants were a growing population of 16 million. Normal citizens probably think all mutants are x-men tier, that's who you see on TV. 16 million x-men and rapidly growing is fucking terrifying.

Supers are 'developed' instead of 'born' (mostly). Basically no one is afraid that their kid will end up Iron Man or Cap because those people worked hard and/or got into a one in a million accident to end up like that. For many of them people feel they deserve their powers because they earned them in some sense.

Every kid can turn out to be a mutant, it's a very immediate personal fear. There's a good chance their power will not be benign but destructive or intrusive or hard/impossible to control or highly visible and requiring a lot of adjustment for quality of life.

And there's no "normal" way to deal with this. There's no school or program. There's just a variety of secretive paramilitary organizations who show up out of nowhere and sometimes brainwash you into agreeing. Your kid disappears and sometimes turns up dead because the "school" got into some shady shit. If there's rumors about the x-men coming for your kids at puberty that would be terrifying.

And then there's the really dangerous powers.

Just the existence of a growing number of telepaths randomly born into a population at puberty is a huge security risk and cause for alarm. Of course people are scared, they are worried they're being mind-controlled by random people living all around them.

Of course they want those people to be registered, against their will if necessary.

And on top of all that, there are asshats like Magneto who proclaim that mutants are taking over and humans are going to evolve out of existence. That's an existential crisis right there, who wouldn't be scared of that rhetoric? Especially when violent mutants want to speed up this process! Yes in theory it's ok for the human species to go and mutants to rise. But not when a dude wearing spandex is having a supervillain monologue about that shit on TV. And plenty of people feel strongly about passing on their DNA and way of life to their kids. It's the same subset of people who feel a difference between adopted and biological children (I don't personally care, but that's a huge thing for a lot of people).

Parents in 616 must get so worried when their kid hits puberty that shit is about to hit the fan... not just their powers, but the politics and the idea that their kid is going to think of himself as superior to them like Magneto preaches.

But the x-books almost never take this seriously.

That's why people keep asking this question. There are plenty of answers, the books don't like showing those answers because they ruin the allegory.

I think Hickman will change that, He is showing very clearly how the X-men feel superior to humanity now.

I hope so. But I doubt it.

I suspect it's going to stay everything the x-men do is validated because the humans are just assholes for "no reason". Them feeling superior is "justified" by some McGuffin making it so, "see [phoenix force/moira/timetraveller/w/e] says the mutants ARE superior so it's not racist to agree with it, it's a cosmic fact!"

I think a lot of readers/authors have totally bought into this allegory and get very personally offended when it's questioned. Marvel knows that and writes books to cater to it. People are cheering for Hickman's superior x-men lol.

I don’t think they need a reason to justify their superiority, they are just superior to humans in every conceivable way. They are quite literally the next step in human evolution.

The one you forget is #5 religious reasons, it has often been portrayed that those against mutation are against god's will, as man was made in his image. The amazing thing that if you look at the real world and comics in truth it doesn't matter what belief system you follow, the extremists hate anything that is different or out of their control. It is often why we see that in the 616 groups that hate mutants at times attempt to use mutants for their cause, and then dispose of them when it suits their needs.

Yeah that's a good point. I guess all I know about the religious angle is groups like Friends of Humanity (I think?) who are just extremists as you say, hating anything different.

The reasons I listed were ones that make sense (imo) and aren't based on bigotry.

It's the whole matter of evolution and one species replacing the other. That in X amount of years/generations, homo superior will be the dominant species over homo sapiens. Unless they keep getting slaughtered like we've seen in the various events.

Not only are they a possible danger to your loved ones when they first come across their powers for th first time and don't know how to control it, but when they do know how to control it, it often means they'll have an advantage over you, your family, and your descendants.

With the other heroes, they are singular, individual people that can do amazing things. And when they die, they'll be gone. (Its comics, so that's not true, but you know what I mean.)

It's not going to be the Fantastic Four, and then Fantastic Forty, and then Fantastic Four-Hundred Million. But it will be that way with mutants.

There's fear of the unknown, of physical harm, of being replaced or left behind, of the loss of self-worth because of this. The Avengers are a set amount of people with a known base of operations and are people that are known and understood.

But anyone could be a mutant and you wouldn't know, whether your in downtown New York or hiking in the middle of nowhere, anyone you come across could be a mutant with a power you can't predict, and any method youve thought of you defend yourself and navigate dangerous situations might not apply. So how can you ever be safe?

They are a species and not an individual person that has been enhanced in some way. That's the difference, and that difference is a big one.

Mutants are presented as the next step forward in humanity. Meaning simply that if you aren't one you are obsolete just you dont know it yet.

The various other heroes fall in 4 categories: trainig like the black widow or night thrasher, technology like iron man or cap, magic like Doctor strange, or mutate like the FF hulk and spiderman. Training is simple, eat your wheaties and work hard and you can save the world so everyone could be it. Technology is simple get in the robot or take the shot and boom you can save the world. Magic is less accepted but again it could be anyone who gathers the right relics or learns the right spells.

The last group the mutates are people who have a genetic mutation that let's the survive and get powers when exposed to some stimuli rather than a whole lot of cancer and dead. Those people while being powered and almost certainly unrepeatable aren't a direct threat to humanity's status as top dog of earth since no matter what maybe at worst their line is going to be a powered and that line can easily be murdered if to scary.

With other heroes, something happened to the other heroes that gave them their abilities (super-soldier program, experiment gone wrong, they gained/have access to advanced technology, or just good old hard work), or they are somehow aliens. In the Marvel Universe, that's easier to understand than "they were born that way". With most non-mutant heroes, the argument is that "they were born like us, it's not their fault that lab exploded spilling chemicals on them that make them fart rabid chipmunks" but with mutants one of the parents has to "be to blame" or "they should know better than flaunt their powers".

Commenting because I don't think I've ever seen a good answer to this, lol. Mutants? Despised. Hunted. Mutates? Loved! Their own penthouse suite and team! lol

the difference between the acceptance between mutants and mutates are the control factor, mutates are made and as such their creator has a measure of how they are mutated and of them. Which if you read the books are often how those programs start, but then go horribly wrong. They then spin in the media and the public that it is a random mutations fault and so random is bad and uncontrolled.

Because people consistently love characters like Spider-Man and the Hulk in-universe.

Mutates are accidents and sometimes engineered. Mutants are natural. The hate for Mutants are the people who fail to reconcile the two. "There has to be something wrong with them"

and there have been hate toward mutates too . many people think the FF are Freaks , famous and rich but freaks after all.

And I remember many kids of the Avengers Academy whose parents didnt wanted them involved with super guys.

More replies More replies

There's an element of control to most Marvel superheroes. You can predict when they'll show up after you hear about some sort of accident involving gamma radiation or radioactive spiders. And I should note, neither of those superheroes are particularly well-liked within the context of the Marvel Universe by the public at large - but they're at least respected for being involved with an institution like the Avengers, which has someone like Captain America as the face of the organization.

But Mutants? Those powers come out of nowhere. Anyone you care about could transform into a monster with reality-warping powers with no warning. And if they don't know how to control their powers, they can be a threat to you. There are also plenty of organizations out there that have bad Mutants out there that could recruit them. The thing that's frightening about hatred for Mutants is that, many times, it isn't without reason.

(I should also note that the whole "feared and hated" angle didn't really kick in until after the comic was initially cancelled. Chris Claremont really hit the ground running with that. Originally, X-Men was a story about five teens and some bald guy that taught them. So that likely contributes to the discrepancy between how these heroes are treated and how other heroes are treated.)

Looking through the comments and I'm a bit surprised nobody said the thing I'm about to say.

I remember in the 90s cartoon (yep, bit biased, sue me, but it's the best I've got to go off of right now) when Jubilee asked why are they like that (why are there mutants) and Hank tallied off things like radiation and pollution. I'd imagine there was a campaign to smear mutants the moment there was evidence found to support that careless corporations are the cause and they needed to cover their asses and continue to make money.

Kinda like how back in the 80s, emails were uncovered showing that Exxon Mobil were very aware of the affect fossil fuels can have on global climate, but instead of informing the public or making better decisions (like, I dunno, not continuing with the use of fossil fuels and help curb us away from its uses as much as possible as soon as possible), they kept it a secret, and started campaigning against "the tree-huggers" and such just so they could keep making money. One of the ways they continued doing this is by lobbying for politicians that would support them.

So it could be a matter of corporate entities and government officials trying to cover their asses by placing the blame on the people affected themselves claiming they are dangerous when it wasn't mutants who dropped the damn bombs in Nagasaki and Hiroshima (I say that because it's humans who call the shots with the nukes, who made the nukes, not the mutants, who just wanna find out what's going on with themselves). Keep the people fighting each other, and you keep an uprising against corporate and government powers from happening.

This is an opinion based off the only explanation given as to why mutants exist I can remember being given from the franchise itself.

I think its because the avengers they have been trusted by people because they have never done anything wrong but xmen some like wolverine have been caught doing wrong things and stuff so thats probably why

People fear/hate what they don't understand unfortunately.

Because the writers of XMen wanted to make an analogy for the repressed...superheroes were written by someone else wanting with different ideas

There is a sentient bacteria called Sublime that has infected a high percentage of the human populace, but mutants are immune, so sublime makes humans hate mutants. It's actually really annoying that Reed Richards never figured this out and eradicated it when he thought his son was a mutant

Regardless of what justifications people come up with, the real answer will always be that X-Men were not initially imagined as being part of a larger Marvel world (no Marvel series was, in fact). The arbitrary distinction between mutants and "mutates" (stupid name, btw) or Inhumans are purely for the sake of brand indentity.

Stan Lee and Jack Kirby just wanted to create a world where anyone can have superpowers without needing to come up with a unique origin story for each characte. The whole civil rights allegory came after, so all the mental gymnastics about new species and discrimination being irrational and whatnot are all post-hoc rationalizations.

Apart from the discrimination angle, X-mutants also break the logic behind creating superpowered individuals. What's the point on working your ass off creating super serums and chemicals and machines and whatever else, when you can simply use one of the thousands of mutants that already exist and have way stronger powers? Even if you really want superpowers for yourself, why wouldn't your first research source be the people who were born with superpowers to begin with? Surely that would teach you a lot more, specially in means of recreating it.

This is why X-Men only truly work in a world where they are the only superpowered individuals, as the Fox movies proved.

Always wondered that as well, but I think the fact that mutants can be anyone, at any time, with zero warning. You know when Thor is around, and you know Thor is more or less trustworthy, but the random incel teenager down the street who just got dumped might level an entire town with a magnitude 10 earthquake.

I honestly never liked the idea of mutants representing "minorities" because it self-defeating. An often spouted rhetoric of racism is that racial/sexual/gender minorities are dangerous. Mexicans are coming to steal your daughters, gays will rape your sons, transmen will sneak into women bathrooms to be perverts, etc, when they are just as human as anyone else.

Mutants aren't human, though, and most are fundamentally dangerous, even if they aren't omega-level threats. You can already not trust self-pitying teenage boys and firearms. Now replace a gun that you have to go out of your way to get your hands on, with an internally produced destructive ability, and you've got a recipe for disaster.

Because Mutants are Walking Time Bombs. People don't know who they'll be, where they'll be, or what they can do. Half of the X-Men's heavy hitters (Iceman, Storm, Phoenix, etc) all possess abilities that could easily destabilize the entire world if they decided one morning to abuse them for the lolz. and those are the ones who had training to help them control their powers. most mutant backstories involve at least one person being wounded/killed by their inability to use powers they just got a second ago (Rogue, Malloy, Zeitgeist, etc).

Tell me what group isn't hated or feared by some other group?

Mutants are the biological inheritors of the Earth - they are the next step in evolution. That's frightening. There is no bargaining, no peace treaty - one is born mutant and that is it. They are automatically inducted into the species - a free political ride (based on current outputs), and acceptance. It doesn't matter what powers they hold, or what memories, it only matters that they have an x-gene, and that they are going to eventually be the predominant force on Earth.

Taking over a modern culture - despite its downfalls - is always a primary fear of those that hate the X-men. Be it mutates, mutants, or superpowered humans, the way that these children develop is primary to how the child is treated. If mutant, the child is forsaken. If given powers by an alternate source, the child is accepted. There is no reconciliation between mutant and mutate, regardless of how many times the species has been saved.

It really is the largest weakness of the men storyline. When they were first created, it was a very clear allegory for racism in America. These days, there are so many superheroes all over the place that it really just doesn't hold up anymore.

Many people, myself included, feel like the X-Men would be much better in their own contained universe or at least one where there weren't 50,000 superheroes in New York City alone.

My heart wants mutants in the M.C.U., but my mind knows it would make no sense for this very reason (and that's not even counting Inhumans).

Writing out mutant hatred - a core piece of the X-Man narrative - just flattens so many great stories and antagonists without massive rewrites (which is still fine, but fans still want something original to remain, for nostalgia's sake).

The easy solution to this is to have the first few X-Men films to be about how Mutants become feared and hated... And that's really not as hard to do as people are making it sound. They spent five movies getting Spider-Man to the point where a significant portion of New York's population would see him as a menace, so there's no reason to think that they won't play the long game here.

Up until this point, Mutants will likely be a rarity (and don't tell me, "Oh, they weren't in the other movies, so they couldn't have existed at that time!", because Eternals, Deviants, Vampires, and eventually Atlanteans are going to have a word with you). Something you only hear about in tabloids, odd stories on the local news, or something that that balding guy running a conspiracy website keeps yelling about. "Gifted" and "Enhanced" people clearly exist already, not counting that stuff on Marvel TV that is probably going to be ignored... But perhaps they're being labeled incorrectly.

And then, after the absolute tragedy that was the death of half of all life on the planet, more of these sorts of stories pop up in the public sphere as people want an escape from the dreary life of a rotting planet. Maybe it's something about the level of gamma radiation increasing ever so slightly as a result of the incidents involving the Infinity Stones. Maybe there's a shock to the system when all that was lost resurfaced five years after the fact. But wherever it came from, the populace of the world has undergone two near-instantaneous black swan events, and with them, there's only one guarantee: change is happening.

And because of all that, there are suddenly more of these Mutant cases then there ever were before. Cases of a subspecies of humanity that are completely unpredictable and potentially outright dangerous, in a world that is poorly-equipped to handle the sudden presence of a doubled population. Don't tell me that that's not grounds for people to be at least concerned. Especially if there just so happens to be a group of Mutants that collectively work against the interests of ordinary human beings.

Pretty sure the Brotherhood Of Mutants was formed due to human hatred, so it's not "just so happens".

Again, we also have Inhumans and the fact that mutates have already been in the spotlight, so I'm not seeing this working out unless it's applied to everyone.

More replies More replies

Not sure that they were created as an allegory for racism in the first place, rather adolescence.

Xavier was training them so their unpredictable, hormonal impulses would be softened to the point that they could be integrated into the wider adult world.

Well for current mcu they could use a terrorist allegory. Meaning some powerful mutant appears one day does some major damage ala 9/11. Suddenly all mutants are suspect.

Yeah people seem to forget that Magneto's first appearance was basically the world's first exposure to mutants. Not a good start. And from there some will jump to the conclusion that all mutants are evil

Yeah Hickman made a nice reference in HoX when he showed that one of the countries that doesnt accept Krakoa is Santo Marco. Santo Marco is a fictional country that was attacked by Magneto in one of their first appareances, He conquered it for a brief time and planed to destroy the country with a nuclear bomb once he was defeated .

Logically Santo Marco is very anti mutant.

well you could do something along the lines of the original Civil War story beginning, a mutant's power goes out of control and the explosion kills many. Then have some conspiracy group start blaming all that has happened on those mutants, perhaps JJ in his viral videos, and calls spiderman a mutant menace. You could also see in the films and shows how people blame mutants for all that has happened. Thanos was really a mutant, Loki was a mutant, Hydra was a mutant organization, everything that has every gone wrong in your life is because a mutant existed, they took your job, they are the reason you can find your keys, it's all a mutant's fault. Then the X-Men appear to try to counter that, but they are a militant mutant group that fights in human cities and then go back to their safe home. Humans need to take the fight to them, and reveal that with Stark gone, a member of the board has stepped up to use his and the companies tech to do that, Dr Bolivar Trask.

You CAN explain why mutants are feared above other supers in a rational way though. There's several explanations in this thread.

The books refuse to talk about it because it damages the allegory of mutants=minority to suggest they are feared rationally and not due to racism.

I don't think moving them into a separate universe will solve anything, just make it a bit easier to suspend disbelief.

Because mutants hold themselves as separate and claim they are genetically superior to humans. That they deserve to inherit the Earth.

I dont see the Avengers making their own country. They are an open NGO that is UN chartered.

True by Avengers aren't hunted by robot death machines.

Trask is an anagram of Stark.

Well they are hunted by Ultron haha. But seriously avengers have been against the goverment man times.

Wakanda is almost like their own Krakoa. A place where they can stay when the world is against them.

They think they should inherit the Earth, but they made their own society? Which is it?

That isnt mutually exclusive. They are creating this new society to inherit the Earth from the non-mutants.

Because it’s an allegory for marginalized people and bigotry and other superheroes aren’t (usually)

other Superpowered being are also hated or THE PLOT DEMANDS IT

Kinda late but.... Well, there are multiple reasons... For starters, the allegory for bigotry IRL.

Second, fear of the impredictability of their powers, as many said

Third, what most people (again) have said, they feel replaced. Think of Fox News when they say not enough white people are been born, or the "being replaced by immigrants" sentiment. The same sentiments is not shared when a Muslim multimillionaire goes to the US, but when it's "normal folks", you know the story. Iron Man, a Tech Genius, or Cap, a patriotic anti-nazi hero, are heroes look up to not exactly because of their powers, but their actions. This is not exactly accurate, but imagine the role media plays into this. In theory, they did something good to get their powers, in Theory, mutates are good people from the start whereas mutants are random people. Of course we know that's not the case, but I believe it is the narrative presented

Fourth, they are more relatable. Think of the American Dream. If you work hard enough you could become a tech genius, or a science genius, etc. Where in the other hand, mutants had their powers "handed to them", which overshadows non mutants, which of course they don't like. An example I could think about is people who idolize millionaires because they believe they can one day become one of them.

And Finally, the discourse. People will always have a biased eye towards the negative things groups do, and well, the source of the actions is key here. When Red Skull does something, he does it because he is a Nazi, or when Carnage does something it's because he is crazy, Magneto in the other hand is because if the politics of mutants. In other words, people will think that Magneto's actions are because he is a mutant, while other villains would be for different reasons.

Comfortable_Note_496

How I got here, by the same question, I'm gonna try to find an answer base on comics, series and movies, but first let's start simple are humans and mutants different? The answer is simple in the X-Men series from 1997 (if not mistaken), also the first superable people I was introduced, I was amazed and confused, why were they hated, why they were different than Superman o Spiderman, and the show that introduced me for the first time to the centinels, got the answer, Trask ask Mastermind to destroy mutants and Mastermind answer was, "Mutants are Humans" and basically claim his idea of a "human world" was dumb, and I know they are a lot reason and theories regarding why are mutants hated in marvel universe, but the idea is dumb, they are universes in which you can find X-Men, avengers and fantastic 4, so let's talk about Captain America the beloved héroe who fight in WW2, he was created by a process the place his body into a machine that make him superable, so his body was place into a change that anyone could claim is a mutation, and people may justify by, he is a hero, he is all American, he was made by us and not freako, but then we have villains and heroes, like Red Omega, who was base on the same process that make captain America and we have Bruce Banner aka Hulk that was made by trying to replicate the same process, and this is worst is Gama Ray's, in which marvel terms is like nuclear, change his physiognomy on a molecular level, isn't that a mutant, so where is the claim that no one wants kids or teenagers getting powers they are not able to control, and yes Hulk at some point in comics, movies and series is hated, but now with MCU and new hulk comic versions is all about ohh see how strong, green and in control of my powers I am, so why not making a version of the X-Men people love but X-Men have to be this underdogs hated by their own society their parents, friends, and if they get overpowered become villains, Jean Grey becomes Phoenix, so powerfull, but if Spider-Man becomes Ultimate Spider-Man he is the greatest heroe ever, and he is what a Brooklyn boy that was bitten by a radioactive spider, "Radioactive" making him what, a nuclear son, and as stated in X-Men movies, humans that undergoes radiation make activate their mutant latent powers, so let's go back to X-Men the animated series from 1992 (yes I know I previously say 1997 but was place again and know Disney+ is placing it again with a continuation), humans were afraid of Jubilee, she didn't have any physical changes and her powers on the series weeeellll, they were pretty, basically fireworks, and she wasn't physically trained as the X-Men, and even with training her powers were still pretty basic, so why fear her, she couldn't take a sentinel alone, most mutant couldn't, so why fear them, fear to what's different and according to Professor X, at some point everyone would have become mutants, next step on human evolution, just letting humanity take a normal course would have gotten to a superable society, X-Men is a great team, more human and approachable than the Avengers, let's take MCU Avengers, we got Thor literally a "norse god", then we have Cap with his super strength and endurance the all American golden boy, yes we have Hawkeye and Black Widow, Tony but he has a Super Armor and Hella rich, but even when they try to make them look approachable like in Thor one, when Odin took his powers well he was still really capable, X-Men have to endured a lot and still got the passion to fight for mutants and humans who hate them, Logan was place under so much pain with science experiments and got traumatized, Jean Grey killed her parents, Scott got his power while being in high school and lost his brother, Hank was being bully for being physically different, Raven took "normal human forms" to withstand seeing herself(when not being a villain), Rogue wanted so much to be "normal" because she wanted physical romance, I got to be honest I don't know what's Gambit dealt but he seem broken, why I don't recalled, but each one of them decided to believe in Charles to fight for mutants and humanity because as the freaking villain machine said, "MUTANTS ARE HUMANS" and yes I know current versions of cómic X-Men are place like basically fear us or face the consequences, but that's basically because they are tired, for society to attack common humans with let's be honest joke abilities or useless physical changes, so let them alone or at least let them be, X-Men have to be shown as overpowered because most mutants are common Joe's, like Jubilee with her firework joke powers or Cypher to translate any language or Dazzler just a copy of Jubilee firework powers, Maggot power basically just being able to digest anything but he undergoes physical changes, basically normal Joe's, who couldn't withstand a fight with a sentinel or with superable heroes like Cap, Hulk, real ms. Marvel not the crappy MCU version, or not even with a normal human with military training, Jubilee is shown multiple times to be overpowered by common folks in the animated series and in comics, so that's the reason recent X-Men comics is showing this version of X-Men that seems they believe they are better than the Homosapiens, X-Men have to make this displays of power Scott is a human concentrated laser, Jean Grey with her godlike mind power able to move anything or control will people or psychic attack them, Wolverine with his superhuman strength, endurance and senses, plus adamantium bone structure unless he is fighting magneto, Wolverine should be able to subdue The Thing or withstand Hulk by himself, Rogue with the ability to basically knockout every superable human just by her touch plus superhuman strength, speed and endurance due to taking those power from others, Colossus being show in the same level as World War Hulk, Kitty Pryde, her power seem not in the same level as the rest of the X-Men but her ability to "phase" is shown to be really useful and capable, Storm capable to command nature, lightnings or an snow inferno at will, Beast having animal sense, strength, endurance, plus being a genius then Professor X with Cerebro if use for bad capable of making simultaneous psychic attacks to normal humans, basically attack us and we will show you true fear, for the little guys who can't defend themselves, that's the difference between old comic X-Men and recent X-Men versions. The old X-Men where trying to save humans over mutants, even place themselves in risk for humans, but they hatred and tiresome got to them, it's not like they would attack humans just bc and say they are superior like Magneto, but they need to show humans, hey fear mutants so they don't attack mutants who can't protect themselves

Most superheroes fall into various categories of “altered human”. They were people once then got injected with super serum, exposed to cosmic rays, bitten by a radioactive spider or invent a flying robot suit. The public knows they were average people once and then became special. And if they did it, so can anyone. Mutants can’t be made, they are born. You are either mutant or you’re not. The public can identify with Steve Rogers and Tony Stark, because they can imagine they could be them. They can’t identify with mutants because they know there’s no way to become one.
