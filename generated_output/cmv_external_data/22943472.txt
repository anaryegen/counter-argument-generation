Understanding Third-Party Software Support

If you’ve ever had a specialist service your vehicle, instead of a dealer, or had a local, small business repair an appliance, you’re familiar with third-party support providers — trustworthy professionals who offer convenience, cost savings, and expertise.

Third-party software support began with Oracle applications (JD Edwards, Peoplesoft, and Siebel), but is now available for virtually any Oracle or SAP on-premise enterprise or infrastructure product set, including the latest releases. Most third-party support vendors have teams of highly experienced engineers that once worked for consultancies, integrator companies, or the software vendors themselves.

Benefits of Switching to Third-Party Support

Organizations often consider switching to third-party support when migrating from one on-premise environment to another (e.g., JD Edwards to SAP), or from an on-premise environment to the cloud (e.g., Siebel CRM to Salesforce).

The third-party support vendor maintains the existing environment throughout the migration while saving you an average of 60% on maintenance fees — funds that can be redirected to support your migration or other business initiatives.

Third-party support is ideal for organizations that need short-term cost relief or are in a longer-term state of financial hardship. Switching to third-party support is a safe way to achieve immediate cost savings and positively impact your financial performance.

Companies owned or partially funded by private equity firms are often mandated to grow quickly and/or dramatically reduce operating costs, making them prime candidates for third-party support.

Innovation and cloud transformation are major motivators for organizations to adopt third-party support, enabling them to sustain their on-premise applications while planning their transformation to the cloud.

These companies have stable, functional on-premise applications and choose a third-party to maintain performance, security, and interoperability while they redirect the dramatic savings towards hybrid cloud solutions.
