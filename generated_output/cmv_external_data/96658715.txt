A place dedicated to insightful posts and thoughtful, balanced discussion about atheism specifically and related topics concerning irreligion and religion generally.

Do you think that religion and critical thinking can coexist?

I don't. I think proper critical thinking would stray anybody from believing a religion, and that religious people are not good critical thinkers, or at least, turn off their critical thinking when the topic of religion arises.

But hey, maybe I'm wrong. If you disagree, I'm interested in hearing why. I know this sub may not be the best for gathering a variety of perspectives and counter-arguments, but I don't know of a better sub to use. Share

So they aren't willing to be critical of religion. Religion does not hold up to critical thought.

I do not see this as an admirable trait.

I do see this as an admirable trait. Think of the intelligence, curiosity and tenacity it takes to overcome religious indoctrination and still be a good scientist.

Something like 5% of hard-science PhDs still admit to believing in a god or being in a religion.

And 0% of them can so much as express their magic beliefs rationally or even coherently. There's no way that these ideas can actually overlap. It means that they are basically just pretending.

They don't have to explain their beliefs rationally. They know they can't and they don't try.

Which is where we start playing fast and loose with the word "belief". If they don't actually have a reason to think that a god exists, then it's hard to say that they believe it.

but can't stop themselves believing in a god.

That sounds like an obsessive or intrusive thought.

They can reason critically enough to keep their inexplicable belief separate from their real work, and that will just have to do, until the neuro researchers figure it out.

I would argue that there is necessarily an element of dishonesty involved.

Religion for many is just a social exercise. Science doctorates don't mean shit in this regard either, I have one and work with people in science and they hold plenty of shit views external to religion. It's just evidence someone has niche expertise, not that they're particularly smart or even critical.

Which involves making claims of fact about magic beings.

It shows that they know how full of shit the magic claims are.

Absolutely. I'm familiar with the scene, but seldom do those politics directly and overtly conflict with the very basis of their work.

People who claim to drink Jesus aren't making a run-of-the-mill claim. It doesn't take niche experience to see that this sort of thing is complete horseshit.

Which involves making claims of fact about magic beings.

Yes but also no, jews are a great example with several I've spoken to at synagogues explicitly tell me they don't believe in any of the stuff that goes on, they just come for the community and because it's what they were raised in.

It shows that they know how full of shit the magic claims are.

It doesn't though because they're separate things. Just because you can pull apart and build an electron microscope doesn't mean you won't vote Trump or believe in a God. They're entirely different fields of expertise. Building critical faculties reduces the likelihood of it, but doesn't prevent it.

Eh, people working in climate driven academic fields while giving zero shits about their own footprint says a lot to me. People are excellent at compartmentalising. Even the devout pick and choose exactly how much of their silly books they apply to life.

I think it just tickles the ritual muscle which exists in all our brains, it's less literal for most people besides the crazy fundies

Can a religious person think critically about a given subject other than their religion? Sure.

About their given faith? Not unless they can come to the conclusion that they have absolutely no true evidence to support their beliefs.

Yes, of course. Francis Collins, former director of the NIH, is a theist, as have been many prominent thinkers throughout history.

People can and do compartmentalize, particularly if whatever religion they learned was learned while their brain was pre-rational (as small children).

I think it is worth it to point out that you can definitely attain noble titles and academic success without having a shred of critical thought.

I still agree with your point, though.

Francis Collins wasn't just made director out of nowhere. He was the leader of the human genome project for over a decade. That absolutely required great critical thinking.

Compartmentalism is one of the most dangerous and most necessary of human brain tricks.

Yes, of course. Francis Collins, former director of the NIH, is a theist, as have been many prominent thinkers throughout history.

But he definitely has to wipe his hind end with any of the critical thought he used in his work to make a claim about a magic being existing.

That’s the compartmentalization part.

Compartmentalizing implies that at some point you actually have respect for the science. You have to wipe your ass with it to make the magic claims.

Science doesn’t give a rip whether you ‘respect it’ any more than the Heimlich maneuver does. It’s a method, not a religion.

Compartmentalizing implies that he’s going to science for some areas and religion for others. I couldn’t do it, but a lot of people can. Religiosity varies inversely with education, but that’s a statistic that does not describe every individual, and the degree to which it is true varies by academic subject area. Iirc, biologists are among the least religious, while engineers and medical doctors show the lowest (but still significant) correlation). I suspect it comes down to the differences between mastering theory and memorizing facts, and its influence on the god of the gaps arguments, but that’s just my opinion.

Yes, but he and the others don't think critically about religion. Collins admits this, he was convinced by a frozen waterfall to believe in the Trinity.

Nope. The Bible is literally an atheist mass-production line. Nobody who reads that book cover to cover leaves thinking they’ve just experienced the word of the universe’s almighty creator. There’s no logic that makes sense to me that can explain why when kids reach that certain age when they set aside Santa, the Tooth Fairy & the Easter Bunny, that they don’t go that extra step of sensibility & lose god too. Religious people older than 18 are what I refer to as “adults with imaginary friends “

Nobody who reads that book cover to cover leaves thinking they’ve just experienced the word of the universe’s almighty creator.

What an absurd assertion, clearly contraindicated by the existence of thousands upon thousands of notable theologians, scholars, and clergy members.

I don’t agree with much in the Bible, but to imagine people can’t read it and come away with any perspective other than your own is…. limited.

It’s clearly the work of various (very) mortal men. It’s not a stretch. Anyone who hasn’t recently sustained a major head trauma would agree….which VERY few so-called believers can say they’ve actually done

A lot of religious people also fundamentally believe that the vast majority of the original beliefs that constitutes religions are just metaphorical stories intended to guide people through life, that these are all stories told by humans to explain creation and to give laws to people so they didn’t kill each other, not the literal word of God. Where these kids of people and atheists differ is solely that people who still believe in some kind of God think there are some aspects of the universe and creation that cannot be explained by science and there needs to be a higher power of some description to explain it, whereas I and most other atheists are of the view that there is a) nothing that requires the existence of God in order to be explained, everything has more mundane explanations than that and b) the extraordinary claim of God existing requires more extraordinary proof than “I don’t know how the Big Bang occurred unless God was the catalyst”.

If that’s the only point on which I and many people who believe in some kind of higher power differ, then I don’t see how I can call them fundamentally irrational

It can coexist. Having faith in one thing, as dumb as it might appear to everyone else does not necessarily prevent you from doubting other stupid shit. Of course you’re more susceptible to BS if it’s related to the thing you have faith in, but it’s not a given. For example, you believe a certain cream fights wrinkles as advertised because you’re not familiar how cosmetics work and what the ingredient list on the back says and does. You still don’t buy that aliens kidnapped your neighbor last night. Believing one thing does not make you immune to critical thinking in general. Never ever paint the world black and white - because this is what extremists do.

No but they clearly were asking if religious views can survive critical thinking. They can't.

In my opinion it can. There are two cases where I would suggest this is the case. First would be in a context isolated from education (like poor sheltered homeschoolers, or the whole world hundreds of years ago). Secondly I think a lot of the time, our conception as Atheists of what religion is feels limited. In my experience, religion doesn’t necessitate belief in a God, or belief unverifiable truth claims. Religious scholar Huston Smith once likened religion to mere wisdom traditions. Obviously though, most religious practices/doctrines include unverifiable claims and thus are incompatible with critical thinking in the context of modern education.

In my experience, religion doesn’t necessitate belief in a God, or belief unverifiable truth claims.

Then it really isn't a religion. Religion needs some supernatural power or else it is just a philosophy.

I guess when I say things like this, what I mean is that religious practices fulfill certain needs in religious life, but that those needs can also be fulfilled through means that don’t require unverifiable truth claims or belief in God. I still count those approaches as religious practices in my own life, simply because they’re tending the same needs; but I can see why you would not.

Yeah, the Renaissance wouldn't have happened otherwise.

Gregor Mendel was an abbot that started the field of genetics by studying peas.

There's too much evidence to think otherwise.

The person should probably have asked if religion can coexist with critical thinking when critical thinking is applied to religion. Many, perhaps most, of us think critically about some things but not about others, especially not things we were indoctrinated to believe before our reasoning faculties fully developed.

A skeptic, in the philosophical sense of the word, would be a person who consciously attempts to question and think critically about every belief they have, and only believe what can be supported through reason and evidence. Necessarily, the skeptic must accept that the correct answer to many questions is, "I/we don't know."

They did. They said:

Their answer implied it, but their question was far from clear.

Do we really know that he believed in a magic being? Most people in that era did not choose their path in life, and if he said out loud how dumb the religious claims are, he would have faced serious consequences.

Mendel was an abbot. I'm not sure if you read that correctly, but he had devoted his life to studying the Bible and God. And he lived in the 19th century. Sure, it was still largely religious, but it wasn't inherently dangerous to not believe in god in most western nations at the time.

I'm sure that plenty of clergy knew that it was full of shit.

Depends what you mean by "co-exist".

Some religious people can think critically about their faith, but start with crappy premises. Does that count as co-existence?

And I don't believe anybody is completely void of religious thinking, even the most stallwart anti-theists among us hold onto some faith in other areas (how many of us support a political party, say?)

Is that co-existence?

At issue is whether or not any person can think critically all the time about every thing.

No human person can do this.

So we end up with folks like Francis Collins and Sam Harris.

So you think having faith in something = religious thinking?

More or less, yes. We might bicker over the grammar, but I am confident that this is correct.

Faith is an assertion of belief without sufficient evidence.

Religion is institutionalized faith.

Religious thinking proceeds from faith.

Note that nowhere did I mention deity...

I think that to have a meaningful conversation we would need to agree that religious generally implies a deity. That being said, I don’t know that I have any assertions of beliefs for which there is zero evidence.

we would need to agree that religious generally implies a deity.

Since this is unambiguously false I see no way to proceed.

assertions of beliefs for which there is zero evidence.

And now I must invite you to read what I wrote and reply to that instead of something you imagined I said.

We can place belief in a deity in a larger psychological context. The type of belief religious people typically hold is dogmatic. And many humans are inclined to strongly identify with a community that holds a certain viewpoint. Sure, most religions technically require a deity. But religious thought has broader implications.

That isn't the kind of faith it takes to claim that a god exists. We can root for a team without going full ham and believing in magic.

At issue is whether or not any person can think critically all the time about every thing.

We have the same capacity for critical thought regardless. People have to willfully ignore it to make a claim about a god.

Part of critical thinking is considering the source. Taking that further is considering other sources. When I was starting to learn critical thinking, I decided to read The God Delusion to check my sources critical thinking skills. That turned me. I think the fact that they shut out books like that, shows they lack true critical thinking skills. Some think it will be a waste of time. If they truly thought critically, they would see science as critical thought in action, but science is often the enemy. I just think they are not good critical thinkers. They may try, but fall short in the religious aspects for fear instilled in them of missing out. Literally FOMOing an afterlife.

Critical thinking like "If I go outside when it's -5 windchill, I'm going to freeze" can coexist with religion.

Critical thinking like "a baby's heart starts beating at 18 days so you can't have an abortion" is neither correct nor critical thinking, but you cannot convince some religious people that some facts are proven by science and they contradict what is taught to them by their religious institution.

Could you have a critically thoughtful conversation with Neil Degrasse Tyson about the origin of the universe if he was in the evangelical church that believes the earth is only 6000 years old? Can you have a critically thoughtful discussion about how women are equal to men and should be treated as such with the Taliban? Can you have a critically thoughtful discussion with the Amish who drive tractors on the shoulder of the highway because they don't believe cars are godly, but tractors that operate using the same technology are fine?

Not in any rational way. Critical thinking is the antidote to magic claims.

No I don't think religion and critical thinking can coexist. Religion gives you a set of dictates and tells you this is what you have to believe or else you're going to hell. Critical thinking is just that and it also is asking questions, which religion just won't tolerate.

This is a straw man of religion

Nearly every high-level debate between theists and atheists is a demonstration that religiosity and critical thinking can coexist.

What you might not recognize is that their critical thinking is being applied so as to defend their religiosity, rather than to tear it down.

NOMA is the biggest BS that actual scientific-minded people have come up with. I think it's a giant excuse to stop critically thinking.

NOMA does not imply that questions about values should be exempt from critical thinking.

Look up "psychological compartmentalization" and "cognitive dissonance".

Take care not to confuse the category of terms you are trying to compare. Critical thinking is a method, practice, process or mechanism and religion is an idea (or a set of ideas). Ideas may or may not necessarily come under the scrutiny of one's apparatus of logic and reasoning. Human minds can curtail and make exceptions for critical thinking when the conclusions (also ideas) drawn from such are in conflict with a belief one holds. It's not the critical thinking itself that is in conflict with religious ideas directly, so each idea or thought process must be compared, and if sufficient numbers of these conflict, then we might be tempted to general say they are incompatible.

Likewise, religious ideas may encourage a thought process that is divergent to rational critical analysis, but here again, one needs to be careful not to paint with a broad brush. Many people's perspective about religion is that the stories and lessons in religious cultures are useful as allegories and abstracts, so it's difficult to criticise based on critical thinking, the way one may suspend critical thinking when reading a poem, a fable, or a fiction. I may draw many insights from these sources even if I know them to be factually or materially false when critical thinking is applied to them, because the content is not meant to convey or be perceived with that kind of focus on factual data, so it may not be a suitable idea to inspect under critical analysis.

That being said, in general, no, religions are not compatible with conclusions drawn from a critical thinking analysis of those claims, if one takes the religious ideas at face value. Many, in my opinion also do not make sense from even the allegorical and pedagogical perspective, even when taken in the context and "spirit" of the teachings. But that's just my perspective.

I'm sure it can if the person doesn't care of their beliefs are true.

To believe religion cannot possibly survive critical thinking, you have to believe that theistic scientists from Isaac Newton all the way up to Pope Francis (Master's in Chemistry) and Guy Consolmagno (director of the Vatican Observatory, did postdocs at Harvard and MIT) have just never bothered to apply their powers of reasoning to their faith. That seems pretty unlikely.

It's more likely that as with a great many academic subjects, it is possible for intelligent people to look at the same data and reach different conclusions.

Religious, not really, spirituality, yes, absolutely.

Some people just have a spiritual connection with things I don't understand, and they walk the ways of whatever the fuck floats their boat.

But religion requires organization, requires rules, rites, community, protection from different thinkers, control. Religion is the appropriation of spirituality.

Of course they can. And it’s not really debatable. Some of the greatest minds to ever exist were theists. And not all religions are Christianity. Many religions promote critical thinking to a degree. Judaism actively encourages questioning. Many rabbis are even atheists, yet they are still Jewish. Disbelieving in god doesn’t disqualify you from some religions. We wouldn’t have a lot of our modern mathematics without the many great Muslim mathematicians.

I think your take comes from treating all religion like western conservative Christianity, which is a closed-minded take to say the least.

Depends on what you mean by "critical thinking." Philosophy and logic have often been harnessed to apologetics, and in that context believers certainly think they are doing critical thinking. To me apologetics is just motivated reasoning, even if there is logic involved. So I guess the answer is that opinions vary.

Maybe bot in most people, but certainly in some. Newton was devoutly religious, but still managed to describe the universe as no one had before, and to invent calculus. Many, many people had to transcend religious indoctrination for the Enlightenment to happen. There are countless examples like these. But I think these people had to be extraordinary. In a world without religion there might be far more people capable of critical thinking. Or maybe not.

As long as the religion doesn’t incorporate supernatural or otherwise non-falsifiable elements, then sure.

Yes, because of cognitive dissonance, so really no.

Yes. Nobody applies critical thinking skills to every facet of their life. In that sense, critical thinking can “co-exist” with all sorts of views that we don’t subject to that process.

I think if you are an atheist but still follow some of the principles of a religion that it can coexist. I did learn how to have a view in life to help others from my religious upbringing, and I can say that it does help me to just be a better human overall.

But to believe in a fairytale is to be foolish.

Haha of course they can. Every person alive has beliefs they don't scrutinise, including atheists. Fuck, especially atheists

I’m an agnostic Christian. Critical thinking has led me to the conclusion that there is no hard evidence for God’s existence, but it’s also led me to the conclusion that the potential falsehood of my belief in God will never outweigh how compelling it would be if it were true.

I refuse to proselytize or to assert religious claims as fact. I preface all of my beliefs with “I believe” when I’m speaking to someone nonreligious or nonchristian. If they are curious, I will outline the aspects of Christian theism that I find compelling, but I will reassure them that there’s no way to know for sure, and they can’t be faulted (even by God) for deciding not to believe.

I feel that critical thinking is largely absent from the lives of many traditional Christians, but it cannot follow from this fact that critical thinking and religious belief are wholly incompatible.

The strangest claim for me have always been the hard deist or atheism stances which claim full or perfect knowledge.

Odd to claim perfect rationality and supreme knowledge in any sentence.

I'm an agnostic for the same reasons but practice the faith to keep the cultural festivals going.

I thought a bit about this and I suppose critical thinking is not an exact point. It's like a continuum. There's varying degrees of it. To which extent some religious thought might exhibit more or less.

I grew up in a Methodist family but attended Catholic schools K-12, but my state is dominated by Baptists. I have quite a bit of exposure to all three, therefore. My experiences, Vis-à-vis old testament:

Baptists/Evangelicals- The racial bigotry, ethnic cleansing, and violence committed in the OT is often (directly or indirectly) Allotted as proof the Jews really are "God's chosen people"- baptist Sunday schools are existent, but often rather weak, so this phrase actually doesn't exist anywhere in the Bible.

Catholics- In all my years at Catholic schools, I never really recall learning much about the horrible violence and other such acts committed in the OT. The Catholics seem to have tried to avoid those parts of the Bible, in favor of the beautiful poetry of Psalms or maybe some of the more rational addages in Proverbs. They neither promoted nor condemned some of these genocidal acts of violence, they just simply ignored them in favor of other teachings.

Methodists- If you grew up Methodist, you know... we're HUGE on Sunday school. Often you'll find Methodists some of the most well-versed in regards to the Bible. We actively learned, somewhat like the Baptists, but a little bit better than them, the slaughter of the Amalkites, for example. But in Methodist Sunday School we were taught this is wrong, this is no longer correct, this is no longer right action, that things like the beatitudes or the golden rule replaced these old ideologies. (However they might have useful information as religious history.)

[I should note here there are still a few sects of Judaism that believe if you find an Amalkite, you should kill them; tho they admit the Amalkites no longer exist, but if they did these Jews say it would be OK to kill them]

What I'm getting at is this – you have the three broad interpretations I have submitted, which one seems more in line with critical thinking? Of course any rationalist would say that the evangelicals are the least critical thinking, the Methodists the more critical thinking, and the Catholics possibly somewhere in between.

So I think a better question is really "To what extent can religion and critical thinking coexist?"

As a further example I would like to mention evolution. Even the Ayatollahs of Iran don't deny evolution. They merely claim evolution is the mechanism with which God created what we see today. Furthermore the Quran says "the world was created over many eons".

I would submit that is more in-line with critical thinking, than Christian Evangelical Young Earth Creationists.

I would finally submit this means that, quite possibly, no religion is "quite there" when it comes to critical thinking; but some are a bit better at critical thinking than others.

Yes of course, fiction and science exists. Religion doesn't have to be stupidity as most of them are now. One of the main issues is that religion does not change with time, because they have THE truth.

Yes of course, fiction and science exists.

They exist separately. Science fiction can't exist with science, or it would stop being fictional. They exist, they don't coexist.

Religion doesn't have to be stupidity as most of them are now.

I'd say it requires you to hold at least one unjustified view about an important issue.

Many stories in science fiction come from, or have root in, science and many new ideas come from science fiction. In the same way that all religions are based on, or rooted in, previous ones.

I think proper critical thinking would stray anybody from believing a religion, and that religious people are not good critical thinkers, or at least, turn off their critical thinking when the topic of religion arises.

So by coexist they are saying explicitly that if you apply critical thinking to religion, you can't be religious anymore. That's what they mean by "can't coexist"

The analogy to science fiction would be, can the things in science fiction stand up to scientific scrutiny? No, they can't, that's what makes them science fiction.

No the OP wasn't asking if people can critically think about one thing and no critically think about another. That's why they say "or at least, turn off their critical thinking when the topic of religion arises."

I understand, I'm not saying it's rational or that it makes sense logically , I'm saying it's a fact. Critically thinking scientist are perhaps rare, but they exist. So for the human mind to be critical and still believe unexplainable nonsense, ie: virgin birth, or justify it to themselves somehow someway it's a thing.

The Vatican has scientists and people that use critical thinking to test claims of miracles. It that I believe in that sort of thing, but they do.

And the fact that they verified even one miracle tells you how critical their thinking is.

It’s all relative I suppose.

The Vatican has scientists and people that use critical thinking to test claims of miracles.

The Vatican definitely deals in goofy pseudoscience.

Religion is based on the lack of critical thinking, so no.

There are plenty of believers in higher powers that execute excellent critical thinking in all other aspects of their lives. Be they doctors, solicitors etc.

It’s more that religion and critical thinking also have a third roommate: cognitive dissonance.

Belief doesn’t mean stupidity or an lacking the ability to critical think. I can guarantee you that there are smarter people than you who belief in a god. It’s just cognitive dissonance affects them.

That's ignorant, religious people ( in most of the cases ) just don't think critically of their belief. If religious people lacked the ability to think critically that would've not led to plenty of inventions made by them. Religion can give a person hope to survive and thrive, I personally believe it doesn't really matter we will all die one day anyways who cares if we thought someone in the sky would make our life better. ( I apologise if my English is incorrect)

Yes, because throughout history, we have examples of extremely pious men who nonetheless made critical contributions to science, mathematics, logic, and other things which require intellectual rigor.

The only question is if the religious person wants to be able to think criticly.

If your religion is based on a set of traditions and doesn’t actually expect it’s followers to literally believe, then sure.

People that the Bible is literal truth give other Christians a bad name. There are so many Christians who just want to treat other people with kindness and use Jesus as a model of how to live your life. But you don’t have to “believe” it to be a Christian.
