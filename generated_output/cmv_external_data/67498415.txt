Medically reviewed by Daniel Bubnis, M.S., NASM-CPT, NASE Level II-CSS, Fitness — Written by Emily Cronkleton on June 12, 2020

Basketball is an enjoyable sport that suits many skill levels and ages, owing to its worldwide popularity.

A standard basketball team has five players per side. You can also play two-on-two or three-on-three games, or even on your own. With indoor courts, you can play basketball year-round.

The main objective of the game is to score points by shooting the ball through the hoop. You use defensive strategies to prevent the other team from scoring.

You can play basketball with a playful or competitive spirit. Either way, it’s a fantastic way to gain strength, coordination, and muscular endurance. Plus, you’ll have the opportunity to be a part of a team and a larger community.

Read on to learn more about how the physical, emotional, and social benefits of playing basketball can improve your overall health and well-being. You’ll also learn how to get started if you want to pick up the game.

1. Strengthens muscular endurance

Playing basketball requires agility, strength, and stamina. You must quickly move and change directions using high-intensity, short-duration muscle contractions.

You’ll also need muscular endurance, which is the ability of muscles to repeatedly apply force for an extended period. You can increase your muscular endurance by playing basketball and doing exercises to build lower and upper body strength.

You can also focus on strengthening your core and back muscles. This will have a positive effect on your stamina, energy, levels, and performance.

2. Builds healthy bones

Playing a team sport, such as basketball, can provide unique physical and mental health benefits.

Research from 2018 found that playing a team-based sport has a positive effect on bone strength.

People who played handball and football were shown to have more bone mineral density than those who were sedentary.

3. Improves balance and coordination

Playing basketball requires you to develop hand-eye and foot coordination as you maintain your balance throughout the movements. As you play, you need to move your body quickly as you jump, pivot, or change direction.

Basketball requires you to use motor skills such as shooting, passing, and dribbling. You’ll also become skilled in rebounding and defensive moves. Maintaining a strong body will help you perform all of these movements with greater ease.

4. Develops fundamental movement skills

Playing basketball offers youth the opportunity to develop the motor skills necessary for development.

Research from 2018 points to the effectiveness of basketball in enhancing the fundamental movement skills that children need to learn.

Playing basketball helps to improve motor coordination, flexibility, and endurance. It also encourages speed, agility, and strength. These skills are shown to have a positive effect on promoting a healthy body weight and encouraging more physical activity, which can enhance cardiorespiratory fitness and self-esteem.

5. Improves body composition

2018 study, researchers found that playing basketball had a positive effect on overall body composition. In this study, untrained men underwent 3 months of street basketball training, which had a positive effect on overall fitness and body composition. After the training, the men increased their lean body mass and lowered their body fat percentage.

6. Boosts heart health

Regular physical activity helps to improve heart health and overall fitness levels. According to research from 2019, basketball increases resting heart rates, which has a positive effect on cardiorespiratory fitness. This is linked to a lower chance of developing cardiovascular disease.

7. Develops self-confidence

You may develop self-confidence as you find your voice and learn more about who you are in a new situation. As a team, members can encourage, motivate, and support each other. They can also point out areas that need improvement, which can lead to positive growth.

Success on the court can extend into other areas of your life, and you may find that you have a newfound belief in yourself and your abilities.

Engaging in physical activity releases endorphins, which are the feel-good, or happiness, hormones. Endorphins may boost your mood, promote relaxation, and reduce pain. They can also alleviate depression, boost self-esteem, and enhance your work performance.

Playing basketball will also help you hone your concentration skills by staying focused on the game. This may also help you develop present-moment awareness or mindfulness. These tools may be effective in allowing you to deal with anxiety in other areas of your life.

9. Encourages team spirit

Playing basketball helps foster a sense of community and teamwork. You may have the chance to positively interact with people from different backgrounds, which can broaden your perspective.

Plus, you’ll learn to play fairly and graciously regardless of the outcome of your performance. Your teammates and you can aim to be supportive, positive role models for each other.

10. Develops communication skills

As you interact with your teammates, you may learn new ways to communicate verbally and nonverbally. You’ll have the chance to talk to your teammates and listen to what they have to say.

Most likely, there will be time to communicate before, during, and after a game or practice. Whether you learn to speak up or stay silent more often, positive communication skills will bring benefits to your athletic, personal, and professional life.

Basketball is suitable for a variety of abilities and ages, making it accessible to a wide range of people. If you or your child wants to start playing basketball, there are several ways to begin.

If you want to play basketball competitively, join a team or league in your area. Check out local athletic or basketball clubs or sports associations. If you want to play basketball informally, you can shoot hoops on your own or with a few friends.

Here are a few basketball drills and practice ideas.

Once you find a public or private court, the only equipment you’ll need is a basketball and comfortable, supportive athletic shoes. Shoes designed especially for basketball are helpful, but they’re not essential. Optional safety gear includes mouth guards, knee and elbow pads, and ankle and knee braces. You can also use athletic tape and protective eyewear.

Talk to your doctor if you’re new to fitness or have any medical conditions that affect your performance. If you have injuries, especially in your shoulders, hands, or lower body, talk to a doctor.

Basketball is an excellent way to get in shape and stay active. You can play it at a moderate or strenuous intensity. Putting in some time on the courts can help you gain strength, flexibility, and endurance.

You’ll learn to move your body in different ways as you jump, pivot, and twist. Plus, you’ll have the opportunity to connect with fitness-minded individuals and work on being a good teammate.

People of a variety of ages and skill levels can participate in basketball, whether it’s a neighborhood pick-up game, competitive league, or weekend tournament. You’ll be certain to gain satisfaction as you reap the benefits of the game, progress on your own path, and most importantly, have fun.
