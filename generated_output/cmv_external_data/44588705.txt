The consequences of delaying decisions

The Proactive Leader

We all want to make progress. We humans are learning organisms and we have a tendency to evaluate our existence in terms of growth and profit. Finding the strength to continually improve is therefore one of the things that we look for in life. Any opportunities that present themselves must be seized with both hands. It is built into our DNA that we want to go further, faster and higher. Viewed from this perspective, it is little wonder that a failure to take decisions is equated with failure and ineffectiveness. Procrastination and avoidance are not compatible with our fundamental human instinct to keep moving forward. Leaders who are unable to satisfy this basic instinct will not be long tolerated in their role as representative of the group. If you cannot win approval and support from your followers, your career as a leader is destined to be a short one.
