Partisan attachment is a major source of group identity in democracies, accounting for a strong in-group bias when citizens make judgments on trust, cooperation, and resource sharing. Yet what factors condition behavioural expressions of partisan in-group bias are not well-understood. Here, I explore the impact of one theoretically-critical factor - election cycles - in fueling partisan-based discrimination and favouritism. Using an experiment embedded in a panel study fielded immediately before and after the 2015 Canadian federal election, I find that pre-election in-group bias levels were cut by a full third within two days of election day. The bulk of the decline is explained by a decrease in willingness to discriminate against out-partisans, while co-partisan favouritism levels remain stable. Further, in-group bias substantially decreases post-election among supporters of gaining parties and among strategic voters, while losing party supporters and sincere voters continued to express it strongly. I discuss theoretical implications on our current, static understanding of partisan-based discriminatory behaviour.

Political parties are a major source of group identity: parties represent the interests of collectives, and voters consequently develop strong attachments to partisan group identities (Huddy, 2013). These identities are inextricable from - and arguably essential to - the effective functioning of party-based democratic systems. In recent years, a large literature has documented how partisan attachments fuels the growth in political affective polarization. The outcomes of these processes are by and large negative: as partisan identities gradually become more salient and more aligned with other longstanding group identities (Abramowitz and Webster, 2016; Iyengar and Westwood, 2015; Iyengar and Krupenkin, 2018; Iyengar et al., 2019; Mason, 2018; Robison and Moskowitz, 2019), they result in is a strong partisan in-group bias that affects judgment and behaviour even in domains that are normally seen as unrelated to politics. Numerous studies document how individuals make socially and financially consequential judgments through a partisan lens - they tend to trust, materially benefit, and cooperate far more with those who share their own partisan identity than they do with out-partisans (Carlin and Love, 2013; Iyengar and Westwood, 2015; McConnell et al., 2018).

This body of research is characterized by two distinct analytical approaches to the role of time: on the one hand, the pace of change in partisan attachment levels is normally measured over years. On the other hand, most recent research that assesses the negative behavioural expressions of partisanship relies on one-shot studies, which by design capture a snapshot in time of the behavioural outcomes of partisan in-group bias. As a result, we have relatively little insight into shorter-term dynamics that might condition people's willingness to act upon their increasingly polarized partisan identities. Nevertheless, political science literature highlights a list of factors that paint partisan attachments as potentially contingent and subject to shorter-term changes, such as the appearance and disappearance of parties, dynamics of political power holding, and strategic voting. Of those, one of the most widely documented regularities is that the overall salience of partisan attachment rises and falls in line with the dynamics of political electoral cycles (Michelitch and Utych, 2018; Singh and Thornton, 2019). At present, it is unclear whether individual expressions of partisan in-group bias are conditioned by such factors, or instead are dominated by the more stable trend of constantly growing polarization: if elections and campaign effects strongly condition the salience of partisanship attachment, should we expect citizens to favour their co-partisans and discriminate against out-partisans at the same levels before and after elections take place? Are partisan in-group bias levels contingent on the electoral fortunes of one's party and on one's eventual vote choice? And how rapidly do such changes occur? These questions are central to our understanding of how and when citizens express their partisan identities, and of how partisan polarization shapes behaviour - but have yet to receive much theoretical and empirical attention.

In this paper, I report results from a study designed specifically to inform these open questions. I fielded a two-wave panel shortly before and after the 2015 Canadian Federal Election, in which the same 1100 respondents participated in a series of dictator games before and after the election, where the recipient's partisan identity was manipulated (Fowler and Kam, 2007; Iyengar and Westwood, 2015). As I explain below, the Canadian case poses a hard test for observing changes in partisan in-group bias.

Using this case, I find evidence that partisan in-group bias levels change dramatically around elections, in predictable patterns. Specifically, I find that citizens' overall partisan in-group bias significantly decreases - on average, by a third - after a few days of a national election taking place. I also observe that the majority of this change is explained by a drop in partisans’ willingness by to discriminate against members of partisan out-groups, while their favourable treatment of co-partisans remains relatively unchanged.

I further theorize that discriminatory giving towards out-partisans changes around elections in ways that are tied to the eventual electoral fortunes of one's in-group, such that supporters of a losing party will sustain high in-group bias levels after an election relative to other partisans, while supporters of the eventual winners will exhibit a pronounced reduction in out-partisan discrimination, post-election. The results provide preliminary support for these hypotheses. In addition, I find that voters identified as likely to have voted strategically show an in-group bias drop that is double the size of that observed among respondents who voted in line with their party ID.

Taken together, these results, while inherently limited in their generalizability, suggest that the partisan in-group bias in altruistic giving may be highly volatile around elections, above and beyond any stable trend that is implied by existing findings. They suggest that changes in partisan-based discrimination on non-political outcomes may also be conditioned by fast changes to the salience of partisan group identities relative to other group attachments, and that motivated reasoning and rapid emotional reactions may differentially impact the importance that different voters ascribe to their partisan identities before - and after - elections.

These findings speak to existing theory in several ways. First, because we know that voter-level partisan polarization provides politicians with a strong incentive to engage in legislative conflict (Harbridge and Malhotra, 2011), and that in-office strife impacts citizens' levels of support for political compromise (Kane, 2019), this study helps identify how the dynamics of the electoral cycle can condition when citizens are more or less likely to support cooperative behaviour by representatives, and when representatives have attitudinal incentives to act accordingly. If voters become far less willing to condone discriminatory measures against out-partisans shortly after elections, the potential for and acceptance of compromise may be highest at this stage of the electoral cycle. It also casts doubts on the ability of politicians to engage in similar behaviour as elections approach. Second, that different partisans express different - if not entirely opposite - reactions to electoral outcomes, that are likely conditioned by their parties' performance, provides a richer empirical and theoretical foundation for understanding partisanship attachment cycles (Michelitch and Utych, 2018). If supporters of losing parties are more willing to use their partisanship as a guide for materially and socially consequential decisions even on the downward slope of an electoral cycle, while winners more readily disengage from partisan-dominated reasoning, then this provides grounds for inspecting cyclical partisanship trends more closely and dissect them by these subgroups. A resulting open question is whether partisan attachment is indeed uniformly cyclical, or whether it is driven by rapid and large fluctuations among a unique subset of partisans, while others - presumably, the more aggrieved ones given an election's outcome - sustain it for longer periods of time. These questions are important for evaluating and explaining off-cycle mobilization disparities between political groups, among other outcomes, and politicians' strategic response to them (Golden and Min, 2013; Wilkinson, 2006). Third, quantifying the degree to which a given election reduces in-group bias levels provides a previously nonexistent benchmark for evaluating similar shifts in additional country cases and electoral systems, and presents a new way of assessing the immediate and longer term impact that elections have on partisan polarization and downstream societal outcomes.

Finally, from a methodological standpoint, these findings underscore the importance of incorporating a dynamic perspective when studying the non-political consequences of prevalent partisan group identities, and of finding ways to identify fast-paced, short-term changes in political attitudes and dispositions. This is a nascent research agenda that has already been producing promising contributions (Michelitch, 2015).

The paper is organized as follows: the next section reviews relevant theory on partisan group identity and in-group bias, and promotes the hypotheses I test. The next section describes the study design, and is followed by the results. The final section concludes.

In what follows, I briefly review the theoretical foundations of group identity and its implications for material discriminatory behaviour in particular. I then discuss existing, static findings on the role of partisanship as a source of in-group bias, and the emerging literature on dynamic partisanship effects. I then derive three sets of hypotheses.

Group identities are a strong determinant of individual-level decision making and of discrimination in particular. Social identity theory explains

This study was conducted in Canada during the 2015 Federal Election. The Canadian case sets a high bar for identifying dynamic changes in partisan in-group bias, according to the typology and data offered by Michelitch and Utych (2018): Canada is a highly developed country with a high quality of democracy, very high party permanence over the electoral cycle, and a relatively small effective number of parties in recent elections. Together, these features suggest that electoral cycle fluctuations

The basic quantity of interest in the following analysis is the amount given by respondents to a recipient in the dictator game out of the amount they are allocated. Because dollar allocations are done out of an initial sum of $100 that needs to be divided, I use dollar amounts and percentage point proportions interchangeably. To extract the degree of in-group bias in giving, I focus on respondents who indicated a party ID, and compare the amount they give to co-partisan recipients (in-group

Partisanship is one of the most persistent and consequential forms of group identity in modern democratic societies. Supporters of political parties strongly discriminate against out-partisans in various contexts, and these patterns are largely unmitigated by the social norms that govern other kinds of group-based discrimination. We know that the underlying factors that drive partisan in-group bias - partisan attachment and affective polarization - appear to be on the rise in many countries.

The Downsian roots of affective polarization

2023, Electoral Studies

A growing literature studies the relationship between ideological and affective polarization. By taking a Downsian approach to affective polarization we contribute to this literature and demonstrating that affective polarization is driven by congruence between citizens and their party, relative to other parties, in the general liberal-conservative space and across a host of salient issue domains. We find robust support for our theory using individual-level national election survey data from the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, and Finland. Moreover, we find that ideological differences inform affective polarization independently from partisan identifications and that they drive more out-party animosity than in-party affinity. These findings have implications towards a more unified understanding of the citizen determinants of affective polarization and the role ideology plays in shaping the views held by partisans across democracies.

Validating the feeling thermometer as a measure of partisan affect in multi-party systems

2022, Electoral Studies

Lastly, we measured discrimination against partisans in dictator games, an experimental module used to evaluate the degree to which individuals change the allocation decisions they make based on the partisanship of the target. This design is commonly used to assess non-political implications of affective polarization (Carlin and Love, 2016; Sheffer, 2020; Westwood et al., 2018). Participants were asked to divide a hypothetical sum of 100 Shekels between themselves and an anonymous recipient, who was alternately described as being a supporter of one of the aforementioned parties.

Affective polarization is increasingly studied comparatively, and virtually all studies that do so operationalize it using the feeling thermometer. Yet this survey instrument has not yet been validated in a multi-party context. We argue that for the thermometer to be a valid measure of partisan affect also in multi-party systems, it needs to capture sentiment towards partisans and to correlate with other measures of affective polarization. Using panel study fielded throughout Israel’s elections in 2019–2020, we show that both requirements hold. We use text analysis to substantiate that thermometer scores reflect sentiment towards party supporters, and demonstrate that they go hand-in-hand with preferences for social distance and discrimination in economic games. We discuss implications for the study of affective polarization.

The Israel Polarization Panel Dataset, 2019–2021

2022, Electoral Studies

How stable over-time are different components of affective polarization (Westwood et al., 2018), and to what a degree do they move in unison? How are over-time polarization dynamics shaped by strategic considerations of coalition construction and by elite cues meant to legitimize and de-legitimize political partnerships to achieve such outcomes (Michelitch and Utych, 2018; Sheffer, 2020)? Answering these questions requires comprehensive data on multiple dimensions of polarization, collected over-time and with repeated respondents.

Research on affective polarization – that is, dislike and hostility across party lines – originated in the study of the American two-party system and only recently traveled into multiparty contexts. This emerging body of research is hindered by lack of comprehensive data that capture multiple dimensions of polarization and examine how they develop over the course of political events such as electoral campaigns or the formation and dissolution of coalition governments. This research note introduces the Israel Polarization Panel [IPP] Dataset, 2019–2021, designed specifically to address this shortcoming. The IPP consists of 10 panel waves, following the same individuals over four elections. We first survey the key features of the IPP and then discuss its applications. The dataset is publicly available and should be of interest to scholars of polarization, political behavior and electoral politics.
