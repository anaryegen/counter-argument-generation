What‚Äôs the deal with Reddit being so anti-religion? I thought these people believed in tolerance

Ngl it annoys me whenever I come across a smug post denigrating people that believe in God. I thought that one of the virtues of the modern secular society was supposed to be tolerance, yet these secular people don‚Äôt tolerate believers. Like c‚Äômon Reddit, just because someone has a different belief or world view than you do doesn‚Äôt mean that person is below you

Much of reddit gets caught up in its own hivemind. Much of reddit is also in a demographic where lashing out at authority - any authority (and who is a bigger authority than God?) - is en vogue.

There are subs where it's worse and subs where it's better. Stick to the better ones and spend the rest of your time with your family and friends. Don't invest too much in Reddit's strange rhetoric.

When you see something intolerant, pray for the person who said it. If it's threatening, report it.

I've been around reddit since the very beginning, back when it was a single front page. When they first added the subreddit feature, the first months were amazing. I often think about the what the atheism subreddit used to be: they used to actually discuss theism. Even saying that now it sounds impossible to believe when you look at the current state of it.

I was an atheist back then, and it blows my mind to think that I used to have lengthy, constructive discussions with religious people on reddit. It shows just how quickly things have dissolved into pride simply over "being right" and getting upvotes.

Reddit's culture equates upvote with "I agree", but I think it would be so great if upvote meant "Well written/good point" whether you agree or disagree.

Isn't that what it's supposed to mean? Up vote for adding something constructive to the conversation, down vote for off topic? I vaguely remember reading that somewhere once upon a time.

It was definitely in the Reddiquette. Not sure if it's still in there, or if the Reddiquette even exists anymore.

I remember when the atheism subreddit was an auto default subreddit alongside askreddit. I often wonder how many literal millions of people have been influenced by that flick of a switch.

I don't mean anything that may diminish your experience. One thing I've realized is that we change often more than the world around us. If you can find them online anywhere, I'm sure you'd be mortified at the things you used to say. I know I am!

Oh, absolutely. One of the many things that brought me back to the church was seeing the way discourse had dissolved, and realizing I was part of it.

That was also my first step back to believing. Atheists had become too smug about their unbelief, and no longer talked about it, but merely assumed they were right. Believers in the true the good and the beautiful, believers in hope and justice and love, are the truly tolerant. They uphold those who believe as they do, and pray humbly for those who don‚Äôt.

Its pretty easy to say it's just a hive mind but keep in mind a lot of those folks got hurt by religion

This is almost verbatim the answer that is posted every time this rant is made.

Tolerance has become a left-wing buzzword that means acceptance of everything they support and a total denigration and eschewing of anything which remotely contradicts their way of thinking.

Bishop Barron has an interesting video on the limits of tolerance on YouTube - you should definitely check it out.

When pressed about this, the response I usually hear is ‚ÄúI am only intolerant towards intolerance.‚Äù Online, they will sometimes link to an infographic of the paradox of tolerance.

Ultimately, I think there is a difference of terms. My charitable understanding is that ‚Äútolerance‚Äù is viewed as synonymous with ‚Äúpermissiveness‚Äù in matters that do not harm others. For instance homosexual acts are perceived as not harming others, thus ‚Äútolerance‚Äù is condoning it and ‚Äúintolerance‚Äù is opposing it.

I think there is also a fundamental disagreement on what to do about acts that are harmful not to others but to yourself. I think many who have this definition would be okay with such things (e.g. if you want to do drugs, go for it, just don‚Äôt harm others!) while the Church is against it (e.g. you are harming yourself with your sin, repent!).

Karl Popper's original point is that society should not tolerate those who use violence to impose their views. That's "intolerance" for him and that's where he draws the line.

It is sad and unfortunate that people have been taking that quote out of context to justify exactly the opposite of what he was trying to defend.

We tolerate them and love them despite heir murderous views on abortion. It's literally the worst thing a human can do, and we tolerate them, because we know they don't know what they're doing.

They do not tolerate us because we're not out there enthusiastically stating our pronouns.

ReluctantRedditor275

My pronouns are thee/thou/thine.

I think technically it would be thou, thee, thine given that's the conjugation order.

Only warning for bad faith engagement and anti-Catholic rhetoric.

By anti catholic rhetoric do you mean ‚Äúcomments that aren‚Äôt true?‚Äù Or ‚Äútrue comments you don‚Äôt like to hear?‚Äù Thanks for clarifying.

The funny thing about people that preach loudly about tolerance is that they are most likely the first people to persecute people who they deem intolerant. That makes the concept of tolerance a bit of a catch22. I think Barron also spoke about this

Also the line between tolerance and acceptance. People blur that line, or they‚Äôll ask for one but really be expecting the other.

Tolerance has become a left-wing buzzword that means acceptance of everything they support and a total denigration and eschewing of anything which remotely contradicts their way of thinking

Tolerance is actually not much preached any more. It was, say, 20 or more years ago. Not any more.

Maybe it was something of a Boomer and Gen X thing, but Gen Z does not consider it a good thing, or have it as one of their ideals.

Leftists are tolerant of anything leftist.

Otherwise, simple dissent becomes "hate" or "racist".

Once the revolutionaries win (which they have), the cudgel of "tolerance" which was very useful during the ascendancy of the revolution goes away.

Honestly, I'd be surprised if you've seen anyone in the revolutionary set urge for tolerance in the past decade or so. So I'm not sure where this question is coming from.

‚ÄúWhen I am Weaker Than You, I ask you for Freedom because that is according to your principles; when I am Stronger than you, I take away your Freedom Because that is according to my principles.‚Äù ‚Äï Frank Herbert, Children of Dune

You are on the wrong platform for any semblance of tolerance. You will think, act, and respond in a way that suits leftists. Otherwise you will be banned.

You will accept that all subreddits are veiled leftist indoctrination venues. Any response that does not strictly align with leftist political views will be meant by a swarm of semi-literate responses from the goon squad hyperventilating about how offended they are by your existence.

Other than that, it‚Äôs a great platform üòÄ

In all seriousness sports is the only topic on Reddit that seems sane IMO

Tolerance is very big here on Reddit, as long as you are an atheist and a liberal

They believe it only to the extent that it benefits themselves as a secular cult. "Tolerance" has always been doublespeak by secularists/anti-Catholics to seize the moral high ground and supplant the existing culture with their own. Evangelization by deception. Because they are clear enemies of the Church, it is acceptable to deny them their demands.

‚ÄúOh, Liberty, what crimes are committed in thy name!‚Äù

If you want to see what eerily similar (thankfully without the extreme violence), read a very good book on The Terror, aka the French Revolution.

I was just reading about the fate of the royal family of France and what happened to little Louis XVII was abhorrent but both King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette would pray and forgive the men harming them with Louis going as far to say in his will "I pity with all my heart our brothers who may be in error but I do not claim to judge them, and I do not love them less in Christ, as our Christian charity teaches us, and I pray to God to pardon all my sins. I have sought scrupulously to know them, to detest them and to humiliate myself in His presence. Not being able to obtain the ministration of a Catholic priest, I pray God to receive the confession which I feel in having put my name (although this was against my will) to acts which might be contrary to the discipline and the belief of the Catholic church, to which I have always remained sincerely attached. I pray God to receive my firm resolution, if He grants me life, to have the ministrations of a Catholic priest, as soon as I can, in order to confess my sins and to receive the sacrament of penance. I beg all those whom I might have offended inadvertently (for I do not recall having knowingly offended any one), or those whom I may have given bad examples or scandals, to pardon the evil which they believe I could have done them. I beseech those who have the kindness to join their prayers to mine, to obtain pardon from God for my sins. I pardon with all my heart those who made themselves my enemies, without my have given them any cause, and I pray God to pardon them, as well as those who, through false or misunderstood zeal, did me much harm."

We are living in a cold reign of terror.

Nah, nobody cares about tolerance. We are probably one of the most tolerant subreddits. Tolerance for the rest of the world means ‚Äúagree with and validate me or die‚Äù.

And gay used to mean happy.

And unicorns were symbolic of Christ.

And rainbows showed the love of God.

And tolerance meant not hating those who are different.

Things change quickly these days.

Well lets just pat ourselves on the back?

We are just keeping the idea of tolerance alive so that when the world is ready to be tolerant again, we can show them how.

Statement of fact, not a boast.

This is a strange case where the grammar contradicts the formal logic statement, "You can't prove a negative."

Tolerance is a lack of action (the "negative" above). If you claim this sub is intolerant, you have to provide evidence of a specific instance of intolerance.

See how this sub reacts to people who disagree with our beliefs. See how other subs react.

Reddit is a left wing sewer for the most part.

You have to curate your feed and avoid that stuff.

Because tolerance is not a virtue. Just a word designed to gaslight you into accepting their moral superiority. They cried for "tolerance" as defined by themselves when they had no power. Now that they have power and are the self-deemed standard of tolerance, they feel no obligation to reciprocate.

Remember you‚Äôre dealing with people who are on Reddit, when on Reddit. There‚Äôs no repercussions for bad behavior online.

The entire West has been and is experiencing a civilisational apostasy.

We simply must recognise this fact and realise that this fact has consequences.

Reddit's intolerance of religion in general and Christianity in particular simply echoes the general civilisational allergy to Christianity.

Welcome to the internet lol

This maybe shows how far the West has secularized and that we should cease putting our heads into the sand. This is not the time of st. John Paul II., in reality there is a large cohort of practically atheist youth (not just agnostics) among younger people in the West. Actually probably over a half, I would say in general around 60%. In believe this irreligion, atheism was taking hold already after 2000, but the militancy hasn't sprung up until a couple years ago. So this is maybe the reason for us being flabbergasted, since secularist youth of the nineties wasn't actually 'anti-religion' but just indifferent. And a part of the aspect is also, that leftist ideas that were practically dormant after Reagan/Thatcher victories and after fall of Berlin Wall, are now reemerging in a way with vengeance. And the Church doesn't have a clue how to counter it (as opposed to Church's strong response in 18th and 19th centuries) due to its reputation scarred and scuttled in the abuse scandals.

It‚Äôs also worth noting that anti-Catholics are behind the sensationalism and exaggeration of the abuse within the church.

They make it seem as though child abuse is more common in the Catholic Church than any other institution, when this is simply not true.

Unfortunately, abusers exist in every single institution. Any position that allows for unsupervised, close contact with children is one that is taken advantage of by predators.

A child is more likely to be abused by a teacher, neighbour, coach, relative or another child than by a member of the clergy.

The world sees the church as old

Church refuses to meet modern standards and change its teachings

Secularists get upset and complain before looking for another church to try to secularize,

that's why I feel the pope is so important as a role, having a decisive leader to guide the church keeps the church stable and following the same path, it's why some Protestant churches have become more progressive allowing female priests, gay marriage, etc. Because they don't have a leader to guide them

Reddit is like the last bastion of the edgy Dawkins/Harris crowd, it's been full of neckbeardy atheists probably for its entire existence.

First mistake is thinking Reddit believes in tolerance or free speech. They don‚Äôt.

It's the paradox of tolerance. There are very few niche places online that are truly free speech, and none of the big platforms (including ones like Gab/Parler/Truth/etc) actually support free speech.

In terms of allowing almost anything, places like 8chan come to mind. People there can freely share their ideas without worrying about getting banned for open racism, calling for violence/death upon specific groups/individuals, support for genocide, racial supremacy, etc. Just good old free speech.

The paradox of tolerance is a rhetorical tool used by neoliberals to cover their butts. It has no meaningful existence.

they aren't so much anti religion as they are anti Catholic. Catholicism is the last acceptable prejudice. Satan hates the one true Church.

TBF, the prejudice is against Christianity generally. They'll praise Pope Francis when it suits their purposes or when his words are twisted by the media.

Yes they hate Evangelicals guts, that doesn‚Äôt mean Prots are right

Which is odd, because the "new atheists" targeted Islam just as much or more than they did Christianity back in the early 2000s.

Once they realized the quick powerplay was to incorporate western culture combined with Christianity as the source of everything bad in the world, other religions got pushed out of the bullseye.

They targeted Islam as bait to garner attention but all of their actual activism work was targeted against Christianity

It's almost as if the majority of Reddit userbase lives in the West, where Islam's presence is minuscule and holds zero influence in peoples' lives. Activists in the West have no practical reason to go after Islam because it's not affecting them.

These were geopolitical activists. They are not limited to just the domestic sphere.

New Atheists were successful and celebrated while they focused their attacks on "approved" targets. In their na√Øvet√©, they thought that they were helping create a world without religion!

But as soon as they dared criticize the wrong dogmas, they were promptly condemned as heretics.

they aren't so much anti religion as they are anti Catholic

Meanwhile on r/Islam they say reddit is anti-Islam.

That's generally how it goes...

Catholicism is the single largest Christian denomination in the US I don't know what your talking about

That‚Äôs just a testament to the divisions within Protestantism. It has nothing to do with the level social ostracization faithful Catholics faces

Reddit also tends to have a bias against police.

I feel that the motivation for both is the same. Too often people in positions of power and authority have misused their power and hurt people. Then many of the other folks in power with the abusers will coverup for the abuser.

Reddit has no tolerance for powerful people hurting others and then other powerful people covering it up.

This applies to the Church, the police, politicians, Jeffery Epstein, and the list goes on.

We in the church see how hard many of use are working to change the behavior of the past and now protect children. But that just is not visible enough outside the church.

Many folks might disagree with me (and downvote me) but as a priest and campus minister this is certainly why I think Reddit is so biased against religion.

Reddit also tends to have a bias against police.

I'm not in disagreement, although...

They do seem to really like the FBI, Father. But, therein lies a paradox. The anti-authoritarian element on the left seems perfectly fine with it as long as it's "their" authoritarian doing something horrific.

I was "discussing" why the war in Ukraine is unjustified in the Marxist Catholic sub. I mentioned the Holodomor during the Soviet era and got attacked pretty badly. Full-on support for the USSR and the communist governments in Eastern Europe, which is an offense to Pope St. John Paul II. The Soviets were the good guys. Everything we know about the Soviet Union is wrong and caused by capitalist propaganda. This was a "Catholic" sub.

Again, I largely agree with you. People want to see justice. Before the 24-hour news cycle and before the internet was in every home, we'd write letters in school to do something to try to make the world better, like writing letters to the South African apartheid government to end the mistreatment of their population, whatever good that did.

But now, Orwell's 2 minutes hate has become 24 hours hate because of Fox News and MSNBC and the like. People get fired up and tribal and argue on the internet. It's very hard to disconnect from politics and remain connected to the news of the world.

I guess the question is why do most platforms tend to lean to the left, rather than have equal representation. I think the big reason is demographic.. Most people on reddit are under 25, people who tend to be more left-wing. That's what I would think.

I was explicitly avoiding taking political sides when I was offering a perspective.

I understand 100%. I think an elephant in the room, Father, is that we are reaching a point where politics colors everything. A generation ago, Orrin Hatch and Ted Kennedy were best friends.

Today, even within the two major parties there is terrible ideologically-driven divisions.

I hope we can reach a place again as a nation where the violence and hatred ends.

Why do you think that is?

What material power and authority does the Church have in today‚Äôs world? Jack sh*t really.

It has nothing to do with power. If it did, public schools would be at the top of every headline.

It has everything to do with the friend-enemy distinction. To them, the school system is friend and the Church is enemy.

I mean that with no disrespect, Father

If you mean no disrespect then the most immediate indication of that would be avoiding vulgarity. Just saying. That wasn‚Äôt necessary.

I think you‚Äôre ‚Äúmoving the goalposts‚Äù

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_the_goalposts

I never said, and few believe, that the church has material power. But that isn‚Äôt what I said. You‚Äôre changing the terms of the conversation.

True, the church does not have ‚Äúmaterial power,‚Äù But the church absolutely has sentimental and moral power, especially within our own enclaves.

We have very significant power amongst those who share our beliefs and who are willing members of our institutions. When those numbers of members reach a certain threshold or National percentage then that translates into cultural influence.

Regardless of how we want to play rhetorical gymnastics that is still a form of power.

It seems petty to twist this simple and obvious point out of shape so that you can then cast the church as the victim.

Until we accept full responsibility for our past and rid ourselves of false idilic notions of religious authority we won‚Äôt be able to become who Christ calls us to be as the Church.

The Left is known for being hypocritical. It's where they are most consistent.

It's not hypocrisy; it's hierarchy. Once you learn who is above whom, it all becomes very clear an consistent.

Edit: This should not be taken as a compliment to leftism.
