Updated August 15, 2024

Teamwork is an effort to reach a common goal that requires group respect and collaboration. In work settings, the diversity of personal behavior types can be a challenge to cooperative efforts. However, by learning more about different behavior types in the workplace, you can improve your managerial skills and help your team successfully work together. In this article, we discuss four main behavior groups and then look at the 12 types of workplace behavior. Understanding these behaviors may help improve your team performance and working dynamics.

Human behavior basicsA study published in Science Advances states that 90% of people can be classified into four basic personality types. Researchers used computer algorithms for a test group of 541 people to determine four basic groups of human behavior: optimistic, pessimistic, trusting and envious. A fifth group, representing 10%, could not be defined by the algorithm.

Envious: The study defines “envious” as those who don’t actually mind that they achieve as long as they’re better than everyone else. This type accounted for 30% of study participants.

Optimist: The study describes “optimist” as those who believe they and their partner will make the best choice for both of them. This type accounted for 20% of study participants.

Pessimist: The study defines “pessimist” as those who make choices based on what they see as the lesser of two evils. This type accounted for 20% of study participants.

Trusting: The study describes “trusting” as those who are natural collaborators and will always cooperate without regard to winning or losing. This type accounted for 20% of study participants.Researchers suggest that there are also subgroups within each primary personality type. These subgroups, along with the basic four types of behavior, are likely to be the foundation for the various behaviors that occur in private life or the professional environment. For example, a leader in the workplace may have an optimistic behavior type, believing that teammates will want to make good decisions.

12 types of behavior in the workplaceEvery workplace contains a wide variety of people who behave in different ways. By understanding the different types of workplace behaviors employees may have, managers can help their teams increase performance and complete work tasks more effectively. Here are 12 types of workplace behaviors to consider:

1. Leadership behaviorA workplace leader is a team member who assumes responsibility and volunteers to help. These individuals typically focus on accomplishments and project directions. It is essential to assess how your workplace's natural leaders interact with the rest of the team. Managers can mentor team members who show leadership skills and teach them to network.Related: How To Be a Leader

2. Creative thinking behaviorSome team members who are excellent at creative thinking can develop solutions to seemingly impossible problems. These individuals like to be innovative. To manage a creative thinker, provide them with a structured workplace and explain your expectations of their tasks. You can balance their workload with both routine and innovative tasks to maximize their output and keep them stimulated.

3. Isolating behaviorSome team members may be isolationists who prefer working alone and can excel at independent project management. As a manager, you can encourage an isolating team member to try new things and complete deliverables with the involvement of other team members. Make sure you also give them work tasks they can perform independently.

4. People-pleasing behaviorPeople pleasers avoid conflict in the workplace and focus on building relationships with others. They want everyone to like them and be positive at all times. They often volunteer to take on additional work tasks. As a manager, you can acknowledge their accomplishments. Help them by making sure they learn to focus on their high-priority tasks before taking on additional responsibilities.

5. Playful behaviorSome team members may be playful at work and focus on having fun. The playfulness of these individuals can motivate their team members to enjoy work more and perform better. One way to manage playful team members is by ensuring that the team takes part in team-building and other playful activities to build team cohesion.Related: Improving Accountability in the Workplace

6. Introvert behaviorAn introverted team member is quiet and enjoys working alone. They perform well when provided with a detailed list of tasks to complete. To manage introverted individuals, you can encourage them to work with team members and provide detailed instructions for work they have to complete. Also, it's a good idea to give them tasks they can perform independently as they typically need time to work on their own.

7. Analytical behaviorThe analytical team member loves analyzing situations and challenges. Analytical individuals prefer working on predictable projects. They enjoy finding the obstacles and possible complications more than figuring out how to overcome them. To manage an analytical team member, you can encourage them to be more open to creative thinking and finding solutions for the problems they identify.Related: Analytical Skills: Definitions and Examples

8. Referent leadership behaviorA referent leader is a natural leader in the workplace, a team member who people admire for their capabilities, confidence and charisma. Other team members often follow them with no resistance, which can help them improve a team's effectiveness in the workplace. They work well within a team and organization but need new challenges to use their excellent leadership skills.

9. Aggressive behaviorAn aggressive team member discharges acts of unplanned anger or intimidation to meet their own needs. Under specific circumstances, aggressive behavior may work well, such as during emergencies or in situations that require quick decision-making. To manage aggressive team members, be understanding and patient. It is best to communicate with these individuals often to make sure they feel safe in their team. Encourage them to share their views on workplace matters openly with you.Related: How To Handle an Aggressive Manager in 10 Steps

10. Assertive behaviorAssertive team members express their workplace feelings and desires appropriately. Their communication is direct, respecting the communicator's and receiver's opinions and rights. Assertive communication assists with the maintenance of relationships and usually results in a compromise between parties. The best way to manage an assertive individual is to be transparent and direct when communicating with them.

11. Passive communication behaviorPassive communicators choose not to express their workplace thoughts or feelings to others to keep everyone happy. Sometimes, passive communication is valuable, such as when emotions are high. When managing a passive team member, schedule due dates ahead of time to ensure they have sufficient time to complete their tasks. Engage with them regularly to discuss opportunities in the workplace they may be interested in, and make sure they contribute during meetings by asking them for their view on a particular issue.

12. Passive-aggressive behaviorPassive-aggressive team members incorporate components of both the passive and aggressive communication styles. Individuals may appear passive but act out their anger indirectly by, for example, delaying the completion of tasks. As a manager, you can encourage open communication and feedback. Try to be firm and calm in your communication, clearly setting expectations of their behavior at work.Related: How To Use Organizational Behavior Management

Why is understanding workplace behavior important?Understanding workplace behavior allows managers to do the following:

Create a high-performance teamYou can strengthen your team through the diversification of workplace behaviors. Different types of behavior add distinct advantages, and some behaviors blend well to collaborate productively. When considering adding to the composition of your team, identify types of workplace behaviors that would benefit your team, and seek new members who could add to your team's capabilities.

Reward best-performing team members appropriatelyWhen a team member performs well, it's vital to reward their contributions to the team and the organization's goals. As a manager, consider that individuals with different workplace behaviors may appreciate different rewards.Related: Rewarding Employees for Performance

Individualize feedback using behavior typesWhen you find that a team member has consistent performance or behavior issues, it's best to have a conversation with them. By understanding their particular behavior style, you can customize your constructive feedback in a better way to help that individual identify and deal with the issue. Together, you can develop a plan to improve their performance.

Customize your management styleTo get the most from your team members, understanding their workplace behavior is critical. Spend some time getting to know your team members to understand their behavior types with strengths and weaknesses. This information can help guide your management style for each individual. For example, you might notice that one team member is a referent leader. By mentoring this employee and teaching them several new skills, you can begin delegating some responsibility to the referent leader, knowing that the rest of the team is more agreeable to policies supported by the referent leader.Related: 10 Ways To Show Professional Behavior in the Workplace
