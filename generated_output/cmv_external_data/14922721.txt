Key stakeholders in the longevity movement offer perspectives on ethical concerns related to pursuing longevity.

Most longevity enthusiasts believe in pursuing longevity in order to alleviate suffering associated with aging and death.

Critics worry pursuing radical longevity instrumentalizes humans for collective ideals and exacerbates existing inequalities.

We discuss whether concentrating on an "ideal" human ​state respects diversity in conceptualizations of successful aging.

We discuss whether an ethical imperative exists to ensure equal access to longevity technologies.

While the major scientific discoveries that would extend the length and health of human lives are not yet here, the research that could create them is already underway. As prospects for a world in which extended and improved lives inches closer into reality, the discourse about what to consider as we move forward grows richer, with corporate executives, ideologues, scientists, theologians, ethicists, investigative journalists, and philosophers taking part in imagining and anticipating the rich array of humanity's possible futures. Drawing from in-depth interviews with key stakeholders (n = 22), we offer empirical insights into key values and beliefs animating the “longevity movement,” including what constitutes an ideal human state, the imperative to intervene, and the role of individual liberty and concerns for equality. Emerging from these interviews are common concerns about reducing suffering, preserving diversity in visions of successful aging and how best to promote access to a future that may not remain hypothetical for long.

Our knowledge of variables that influence exceptional longevity in humans continues to grow, from biological to genetic factors contributing to survival into extreme ages (Pradas et al., 2019; van den Berg et al., 2019), to advancements in prosthetics and artificial organs, skin, and muscle that stand poised to reduce or remove physiological human limitations (Acome et al., 2018; Grimmer, Riener, Walsh, & Seyfarth, 2019). These rapid advancements in biomedical and biotechnological innovation, coupled with the recently reinvigorated debate about the natural limits of human lifespans (Brown, Albers, & Ritchie, 2017; de Beer, Bardoutsos, & Janssen, 2017; Hughes & Hekimi, 2017; Lenart & Vaupel, 2017; Rozing, Kirkwood, & Westendorp, 2017), creates a renewed urgency to consider what we wish to prioritize in the context of our growing capacity to delay, stop, or even reverse aging. As part of this effort, we turn to key stakeholders in the “longevity movement” (Scott & DeFrancesco, 2015) to examine what they perceive to be the broader goals, values, and ethical imperatives shaping the pursuit of longer, healthier lives in light of modern approaches to human life extension. These are embedded in larger narratives about technology, aging, and death, and how we should prioritize today's resources in anticipation of an imagined—and sometimes idealized—future.

Over fifteen years ago, Juengst et al. (Juengst, Binstock, Mehlman, & Post, 2003) called for better engagement of the public into conversations about aging. His appeal encouraged a number of inquiries into what is meant by “successful aging,” which can be culturally or individually defined based on personal beliefs (Flatt, Jr, Ponsaran, & Fishman, 2013; Lamb, 2014), as well as lay attitudes toward life extension and its technologies. These works reveal general support (in Western culture) of

Our interviews build on a preliminary content analysis (first research phase) of literature, media, and interviews with longevity researchers (n = 15) that identified major technologies and diseases in play in the “longevity movement” (Scott, 2017) and uncovered stakeholders for semi-structured interviews for the present study (second phase). Many of the candidates interviewed in this second phase of the project (n = 22, see Table 1) were identified using snowball sampling of contacts from the

Pursuit of the “ideal” human state and reduction of human suffering

Most longevity advocates emphasized that they are not pushing for—nor do most believe in—immortality. Instead, they explained that their goal is to extend the health span—not just the life span—via anti-aging therapies, regenerative medicine, and curing diseases of old age like dementia and Alzheimer's. Proponents emphasized therapy over enhancement, viewing aging as a disease rather than a natural process solely governed by biology. In this way, they conceptualized the “fight against aging” as

Debating moral and social issues raised by longevity technologies helps society actively work toward a desirable future and avoid or prepare for problems we cannot prevent (Harris, 2000). A primary point of agreement among stakeholders – including those who feel deeply passionate versus acutely critical of pursuing human longevity – is that we need to reach a consensus about priorities in the pursuit of life- and health-span technologies. Binstock (2004)) and Jeungst el al. (Juengst, Binstock,

The questions of preserving personal choice and expanding access are important because anticipating the worst outcomes can help us to avoid potential problems and maximize potential benefit. Avoiding bleak but remote futures, however, cannot come at the expense of important innovation today, and scientific advancement cannot be held hostage at the altar of equality. Perhaps a challenge that transcends neat or elegant solutions is whether we can avoid unwise expenditures (both public and

Seven open questions in the futures of human genome editing

Scholarly discussion around the governance of human genome editing (HGE) recognizes that development and application of HGE techniques could result in unexpected societal outcomes. However, it contains few to no methodological models for how to anticipate, prepare for, or shape such outcomes. This article presents early-stage results from research guided by anticipatory governance, a framework for broad expert and public consideration of innovation processes and purposes. We present and discuss key themes emerging from a set of future-oriented interviews with genome editing practitioners and experts, designed to inform broadly scoped deliberations about plausible futures of HGE. We articulate our results as seven “open questions,” the answers to which will be important components of HGE’s eventual shape and outcomes. Some themes are perennial in studies of science and society, and others are more novel to HGE. Each helps to reframe HGE beyond a simple comparison of risk and benefit. Such reframing opens up new and important terrain for discussion among policymakers, academics, scientists, and publics. We suggest that discussion framed around broad and reflexive questions like those presented here will help governance efforts to better acknowledge and flexibly respond to the uncertainty and complexities of HGE developments.
