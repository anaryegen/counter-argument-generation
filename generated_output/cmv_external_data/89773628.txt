 The new findings reveal the subconscious impact of music – and, crucially, how it differs from the conscious response.

The report, named ‘A large-scale investigation into the effects of music in advertising’, builds on SoundOut and Goldsmiths’ work mapping the conscious emotional impact that music has on consumers.

Largely financed by the UK government’s Innovate Fund, the project was of unprecedented scale and ambition both in the field of academia and commerce. The findings provide a rigorous foundation for a suite of technology tools that will enable brands and agencies to harness the emotional impact of music to strengthen brand associations.
