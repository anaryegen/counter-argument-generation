A. Brown, in International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioral Sciences, 2001

For Communists the term ‘Communism’ meant both an international movement dedicated to the overthrow of capitalist systems and a classless society which would exist only in the future. What are generally known as Communist systems were called ‘socialist’ by the Communists themselves. These systems, which first came into being with the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, were not uniform over time or between countries. They were not always totalitarian but never less than highly authoritarian. Although there was enough variation to encourage the study of ‘comparative Communism,’ Communist systems possessed five common features which, taken together, distinguished them from other authoritarian regimes and, still more fundamentally, from socialism of a social democratic type: (a) the monopoly of power (‘leading role’) of the Communist Party; (b) intra-party relations which were highly centralized and strictly disciplined (‘democratic centralism’); (c) state, rather than private, ownership of the means of production; (d) the building of communism as the ultimate, legitimizing goal; and (e) a sense of belonging to an international Communist movement. The zenith of Communism was a forty-year period between 1949 and 1989 when more Communist regimes existed than at any time before or since. By the beginning of the twenty-first century there were only five Communist states left, including China, compared with 23 in 1985.Read more

Post-Socialism: Political Economy

Aleksandra Sznajder Lee, in International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioral Sciences (Second Edition), 2015

Communist Legacies and Challenges to Economic Reform

These daunting reforms were complicated by the type of development transition economies had undergone during the communist system. All of the countries discussed here had large industrial sectors, ranging from 30% GDP in Hungary to 59% in Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, 1999). More problematic than the sheer extent of these economies' reliance on industrial production was the type of industrial production in which they were engaged. The effort to build a communist economy entailed a massive modernization project where heavy industry, rather than industries producing consumer goods, played the primary role. Because success was measured by output, and the enterprises did not have a hard bottom line, industries such as steel, heavy machinery, armaments, and chemicals suffered from overcapacity and inefficiency in the context of a market economy. The case in point was Czechoslovakia, where the communist authorities sought to close the developmental gap between the Czech lands (Bohemia and Moravia) – the most industrially developed in CEE – on the one hand, and the largely agricultural Slovakia, on the other. They succeeded, but industrial development took, in part, the form of armaments factories that serviced the needs of the Warsaw Pact. The end of the Cold War rendered these obsolete and greatly complicated the reform process in Slovakia (Wolchik, 1994: p. 64). The monoindustrial towns throughout the postcommunist region, where the entire local economy revolved around a single giant enterprise faced particular economic and social challenges.

Despite their shared legacy of central planning, membership in the barter-based, Soviet-sponsored Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, and political dependence on the Soviet Union, the former communist countries did not all begin the reform process from the same starting point. Even though they shared the same basic challenges, their exact nature and severity varied by country. These differences were rooted in the historically contingent nature of communist rule in each country. There are nuanced typologies of communist regimes in CEE that take into consideration the relationship between the communist authorities and society (see Kitschelt et al., 1999). For the sake of simplicity, however, communist regimes can be broadly divided into more ‘liberal’ and ‘orthodox’ in their approach to political and economic developments.

The more liberal regimes, most notably Poland and Hungary, allowed for greater personal freedoms than their more orthodox counterparts, and they also engaged in forms of economic liberalization. Both countries allowed private enterprise to exist. Private sector's share in GDP equaled 30% in Poland and 25% in Hungary in 1990 (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, 1999: pp. 228, 252). The relatively large private sector in Poland resulted from aborted efforts at collectivizing agriculture, which then remained largely in the hands of individual farmers. It also stemmed from limited forms of small private businesses. Hungary's private sector reflected the Hungarian regime's tolerance of the so-called second economy, or parallel markets, where individuals, often using machinery leased from state enterprises, would produce consumer goods undersupplied by the state (Stokes, 1993: p. 81).

Both countries' relative openness to the West also had its price as it led to accumulation of large amounts of foreign debt in the 1970s. The abundance of petrodollars and ease of credit created incentives to engage in a Western loan-financed, large-scale industrial investment project extravaganza. The projects had disappointing results, and the countries were left with the bill. By contrast, Czechoslovakia had very little foreign debt, as did East Germany, which nonetheless benefited from significant (unofficial) West German subsidies. Bulgarian foreign debt only ballooned in the late 1980s while Romania paid off the entirety of its foreign debt as part of its leader's brutal campaign for total independence from the West (Stokes, 1993: p. 143).

The communist-era economic reform efforts in both Poland and Hungary led to partial liberalization prior to system change, but these measures created the need and opportunity for further reform. Partial price liberalization fueled inflationary pressures. So did the self-management of enterprises where the managers faced worker pressures for increased wages. The same was the case in Yugoslavia, which was not a Soviet satellite state and followed its own version of socialist self-management. Interestingly, similar problems also surfaced in the aftermath of Gorbachev's perestroika reforms in the Soviet Union, which preceded its breakup.

If the more ‘liberal’ communist states had already been exposed to some of the elements of rudimentary market principles, they were also westward-oriented in terms of seeking assistance with further reforms. The case in point was the joining of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank by Hungary in 1982 and by Poland in 1986, and the allowing of the creation of joint ventures with foreign capital. The pinnacle of westward orientation was a move that dramatically flew in the face of communist ideology: the decision of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party to attempt to sell more than 50 SOEs to foreign owners in January 1989 (Stark and Bruszt, 1998: p. 54).Read more

Capitalism and Division of Labor

M. Brayshay, in International Encyclopedia of Human Geography, 2009

An intermediate stage of capitalism occurring in late-Medieval England that laid foundations for the emergence of merchant capitalism and, later, industrial capitalism. Feudal tenancies were replaced by leases at costs that obliged peasant farmers to specialize and produce competitively for the market.

A system where goods and services are produced for profitable exchange in a free market. The means of production are privately owned, usually by independent companies operating competitively, and accumulated capital is reinvested in further production. Goods and services are produced by labor working for wages, and money is used to mediate the processes of distribution and exchange.

It refers, for example, to raw materials or intermediate products, as one of the two types of capital among the factors of production. The other factors of production are land, labor, and entrepreneurship (see fixed capital).

The process whereby every element in an economic system is assigned a price and is able to be bought and sold.

(see Marxism) A highly centralized political system and centrally planned command economy in which private enterprise and free trade are eliminated, and agriculture and industry are collectivized. Communist regimes have also aimed to acquire military power as a bulwark against the perceived threat of the capitalist world.

Comparative Advantage

The theory developed to explain why it can be deemed beneficial for two countries to engage in trade even though one of the parties might be easily capable of producing all the goods involved itself.

The ‘functional’ subdivision of production processes into a series of separate operations, each carried out by workers possessing relatively few skills, whose wages cost less than those of fully skilled individuals capable of producing the entire product. It also means the ‘geographical’ subdivision of production whereby the components of a particular product are made wherever efficiency and cost effectiveness can be maximized and subsequently brought together for final assembly. A ‘gendered’ division of labor is a wider concept covering both socially determined gender roles within societies, and the assignment of particular kinds of employment to men and women within an economy.

Right-wing authoritarian, centralist political philosophies promoting militaristic nationalism, which favor strong state economic control and regulation, and are suspicious of Western liberal capitalist democracy.

It describes a range of socioeconomic systems, generally comprising intricate linkages between lords, vassals, and land resources that existed in Medieval Europe as well as elsewhere in the world.

It refers, for example, to the plants or factories where goods are made, as one of the two types of capital that forms a factor of production (see circulating capital).

A form of industrial capitalism (taking its name from Henry Ford's pre-World War I Detroit motor car factory) that came to dominate Western economies, especially between 1945 and the 1970s, characterized by mass production through the assembly line, relatively high industrial wages leading to (through the virtuous circle) mass consumption.

All economic decisions regarding the buying and selling of goods, services, and money take place voluntarily and are free from any coercive government influence. Individuals trade, bargain, cooperate, and compete in an unfettered and decentralized manner, and the role of government is to defend market freedoms and the rights of an individual to determine the price at which he or she will sell their property.

It involves speculating on the future price of derivatives (financial instruments based on the value of shares, bonds, currency relativities, and commodities). If a trader expects a price will rise, then a fixed-term ‘future’ in it will be purchased, which means that when the term expires the original agreed purchase price will fall due. Assuming prices have risen, resale at the new prevailing value will yield a profit to the trader. However, if prices fall, losses will be incurred. ‘Options’ on futures are more sophisticated deals that allow traders flexibility about when to commit themselves to a futures deal. While futures can be a means of reducing uncertainty and risk, they have become a form of ‘casino capitalism’ comprising more or less informed guesses about forthcoming movements in prices.

Gentlemanly Capitalism

It describes the small elite group of London-based individuals who managed investment in, and the running of, Britain's colonial economy from the late 1600s until the 1930s. The theory identifies financial capitalism as the key driver and determinant of British colonial activity and imperialism.

The creation, extension, or maintenance of political and/or cultural, and/or economic control of territory beyond that of the imperial power. The term has acquired a pejorative, negative meaning and it is important to note that, like colonialism, different connotations were implied by using the term in the past.

Industrial Capitalism

The development of the so-called factory system of production, characterized by complex and intricate divisions of labor, both within and between production processes, associated strongly with the proletarianization of the laboring classes. The industrialist takes the place of the merchant as the key player in the capitalist system.

Complex and fundamental cultural, philosophical, political, and ethical objections to those aspects of the Western way of life that are regarded as degenerate. Includes opposition to the conspicuous consumption and profligate spending of the super-rich and the stark social inequalities that pervade some of the strongest Western democracies and offend Muslim teachings on charity and social justice. There are also Muslim ethical objections to Western bank interest charges that have led to the development of Islamic banking.

The ideas of the English economist, John Maynard Keynes (1883–1946), that capitalism is compatible with government economic intervention regarding taxes, interest rates, market regulation, and regional policy aimed at promoting higher levels of demand, countering unemployment, and combating deflation.

Laissez-Faire Economics

It describes a system in which individuals trade, bargain, cooperate, and compete in a free and unregulated manner. Governments defend market freedoms and safeguard the rights of private property ownership.

Resources that are necessary for any form of production to occur. Usually taken to include money capital, land, raw materials, machines, labor, knowledge and information, and entrepreneurial acumen.

Merchant Capitalism/Mercantilism

A phase of capitalist evolution in which merchants engaged in a spatially expanding network of trade in staple commodities and manufactured goods (the latter still mostly produced by artisans and craftsmen). Mercantilism involved state controls, subsidies, and monopolies that regulated and protected the activities of merchant traders.

Systems in which some of the means of production and distribution are state controlled and operated primarily as public services rather than for profit, but other parts of the economy are in private ownership and operation.

The theory developed by the US economist, Milton Friedman, that the health of the economy of a country is determined by the amount of money in circulation.

Costs of producing an item or a service in terms of the opportunity foregone (or the benefits lost) of not producing the next most valuable alternative.

Emerging since the 1970s, this form of production emphasizes flexible production, often made possible by the development of versatile, programmable machinery, capable of responding rapidly to changing consumer demand and market conditions.

The process whereby feudal peasants became landless wageworkers within the capitalist system.

Those obliged to sell their labor in return for wages in order to earn a living within a capitalist system.

Economic conditions in which high levels of price and wage inflation coincide with abnormally low levels of economic growth, resulting in high rates of unemployment.

Transnational Corporations

Very large companies that run plants and offices in several different countries and often take business decisions and make profits on a global basis.

Governments levy taxes in order to raise revenues to pay for a large measure of social provision such as unemployment benefit, healthcare, and pensions for the elderly.

World Systems Theory

A dynamic structural explanation of the evolving spatial characteristics of the capitalist world economy in which a fluid mix of core, peripheral, and semi-peripheral territories is defined. Core regions, with higher wages, advanced technology, and diversified production, exploit both the semi-periphery and the periphery. With low wages, simpler technology, and limited production, peripheral regions are economically subordinated. Semi-peripheral regions are capable of exploiting the periphery, but are themselves exploited by the core.Read more

LABOR RELATIONS DURING THE KOREAN CIVIL GOVERNMENT

Jae Won Kim, Sonja Tsi Hae Amberg, in South Korea, 2008

3.1.1 Rhee Syung Man Regime: The Rise of Patron Client Relationship and the Change to Repressive Labor Policy

The Rhee regime from 1945 to 1960 can be characterized as a “paternalistic and anti-communist regime with limited democracy or soft authoritarianism”. Because of political and economic instability and strong anti-communist ideology the Rhee regime excluded leftist groups from the civil society. The definition of left was broad and included communist dissidents as well as those advocating a radical change of the Korean society. Nevertheless, because of the US pressure, the Rhee regime ostensibly followed basic democratic principles.

In the beginning the state labor relations can be characterized in terms of a patron client relationship. Later based on economic and political reasons, the Rhee regime tightened the control over labor. One can suggest that import substitution adopted by the Rhee regime allowed it to develop a patron client relationship with labor. In contrast to export oriented strategy, import substitution did not pressure Rhee to suppress labor in order to gain a comparative advantage. Due to student uprising opposing authoritarianism and corruption, the Rhee regime collapsed in 1954.

Among the major labor laws which were enacted under the Rhee regime were the Labor Union Act, the Labor Dispute Mediation Act and Labor Standards Act. Major laws which reflect exclusionary labor policy of the Rhee regime can be considered to be the following: The Labor Union Law of 1953 introduced a decentralized collective bargaining system and enabled the coopted national union leadership to neglect the pressures from the base. Further, enterprise unionism aimed to isolate local unions from each other and contributed to the increase of managerial despotism, such as economic repression of labor. In addition, the National Public Service Law (NPSL) prohibited the unionization of public employees. This law was highly effective in weakening organized labor.

In addition, the fact that some provisions in Korean labor laws replicated Japanese and German labor laws benefited also the exclusionary labor policy of the Rhee regime. The replicated laws with relatively high labor standards were not suited for Korea. Because of the significant gap between norm, on the one hand, and reality, on the other hand, it was commonly believed that the labor laws had to be not respected (Y. B. Park).Read more

Post-Socialist Cities

L. Sýkora, in International Encyclopedia of Human Geography, 2009

Cities in former socialist countries were shaped by socialist principles adapted by the ideology of leading communist parties. The nature of socialist, political, and economic systems was radically distinct from capitalism. As a consequence, the impact on the built environment, land use, and residential differentiation yielded distinct patterns which contrast with capitalist urban development. Socialism was implanted by a radical reform to the preexisting social and cultural milieu as well as to the built environment. Most cites developed prior to socialism under feudal and capitalist conditions. The exceptions were new towns erected under the communist regime and that were numerous especially in the former Soviet Union. The urban environment itself differed because individual socialist countries were in strikingly different phases of industrialization and urbanization process. Furthermore, socialism itself was not uniform. It varied across regions and so did its influence on urban development.

The main political aim of the socialist system was to create a socially just society. This was supposed to be achieved by eliminating capitalist mechanisms, thought to be responsible for producing social inequalities and replacing them with a new, socially just system of production and distribution of societal resources. The key aspects of the socialist system were the common ownership of the means of production and the administrative allocation of resources governed by the state and the ruling communist party (consequently, some authors prefer to use the term ‘state socialism’ or ‘communism’). Socialist society was considered as a temporary phase in the transition to a classless communist society where everyone would contribute with her/his abilities and receive according to her/his needs.

The common ownership of almost all means of production was achieved through nationalization. Nationalization brought enterprises from private ownership to the hands of the state, and thus the exploitation of workers by capitalists was removed. To alleviate inherited injustices in housing, dwellings were redistributed from bourgeois to working-class families. However, the system highly favored communist party members and officials. Socialist ownership (state and cooperative) received explicit preference over private ownership. Furthermore, a distinction was made between personal ownership (given by the amount appropriate for the use by household) and private ownership (property in excess of what would be considered as appropriate to possess at household level thus providing means for extra income). For instance, while single-family houses were considered personal ownership, apartment buildings with dwellings for lease demonstrated private ownership, as they presented a capitalist mean that provided rent to the owner.

The distribution of revenue among employees, companies, and governments was regulated by the system of central planning. Central planning integrated political control and economic coordination of the state and the communist party. The main objective was to achieve economic growth that would guarantee an increasing quality of life and socially equitable distribution of scarce resources. Priority was given to production and strategic (mostly heavy) industries in certain regions. A significant portion of resources were allocated to the military complex.

On the individual and family level, the allocation of resources was governed by needs declared by the state. The administrative allocation set standards and regulated price levels. Support was provided for basic needs, not luxury goods. For instance, there was a normatively given relation between family size and the size of dwelling corresponding to it. An excess space was charged with higher rent. Public housing was heavily subsidized and real property transactions were governed by the state. Land rent in terms of the mechanism of spatial allocation of functions did not exist. The spatial allocation of investments was determined by a complex hierarchically organized structure of decision making within the system of central planning. Priorities in the redistribution of scarce resources yielded new economic, social, and territorial disparities. The administrative allocation resulted in new inequalities specific to socialism.

Socialism created specific features in cities. Since many legacies of previous capitalist and feudal systems could not be easily removed or eliminated, the socialist cities incorporated a significant share of pre-socialist areas and the inherited built environment importantly determined the development of land-use patterns under socialism. The new construction concentrated (beside infill developments) right at the city edge in high-density residential areas of multistory apartment buildings (see Figure 1), thus maintaining a compact urban form that contrasted with the sprawling North American and spreading West European cities. Although capitalist urban landscapes were affected by similar modernist planning ideas, the scale of housing estates constructed for several thousands of inhabitants, and the consequently high proportion of multiple-family housing noticeably distinguished the socialist city from the capitalist city. The inner-city decay that could be similarly observed on both sides of Iron Curtain was caused by the disinvestment of the state as the main landlord, whose prime concern was to build new socialist areas. Renewal was applied in some places beginning in the 1970s, leading to brutal reformulations of pre-socialist inner-city landscapes. Reconstruction and regeneration of old structures were used in an experimental form only during the 1980s.

Figure 1. The pattern of investment and disinvestment in socialist and post-socialist city.

The lower share of services and higher share of industry in terms of both employment and land use stem from the nature of the socialist political-economy including its strategy to keep manual workers as the revolutionary force in major cities. Thus, massive industrial areas spread from old inner-city locations to newly established outer-city zones. Services were distributed in a hierarchical structure of city, sector, and residential district centers, in order to guarantee economies of scale as well as even accessibility of population from residential areas to individual types of services. The commuting between places of residence, work, services, and leisure activities was assured by a dense network of public transportation. Central areas retained a significantly high share of residential function. The political role of city centers was accentuated through the location of government and communist party buildings there. Centers were prime locations of culture with the presence of numerous cultural amenities, such as museums or theaters. Although central areas concentrated on retail and other consumer services, they did not resemble the picture of capitalist urban downtowns dominated by commerce and corresponding business-driven architecture.

In socialist cities, population in urban space was primarily differentiated by demographic characteristics. This was caused by spatially concentrated housing construction, housing allocation to young generations, and a low level of migration. Consequently, particular generations of housing estates corresponded with certain age cohorts and their positions in family life cycle. There was a lower level of residential socioeconomic differentiation compared to the capitalist cities. However, residential socioeconomic inequalities still existed. This was not only because of the uneven nature of the residential environment and housing stock but also due to the mechanisms of housing allocation under socialism. Certain groups of people received better housing based on higher societal or communist party merits. This resulted in a pattern of large areas characterized by a social mix of households, less segregated and more evenly distributed lower social status population and a concentration of elite in exclusive neighborhoods. On the macro-level, social status declined with the growing distance from city center, with sharper decline in some inner-city sectors and stronger social status of some well-located new housing estates (see Figure 2). On the micro-level, a mosaic of various socially mixed residential areas reflected the combined effects of past and present as well as the less socially deterministic nature of the administrative allocation of housing. In the cities within the Soviet Union, the sociospatial pattern was even further complicated by ethnic differences caused by migration movements between Soviet Republics within the whole country territory.

Figure 2. Social status of population in socialist city and its changes during post-socialist transformations.

As socialism emerged as a fundamental alternative to capitalism, the socialist city was an alternative to the capitalist city. This was not only for the normative goals based on socialist principles but also due to the outcomes of the really existing socialism. Similar to capitalist cities, the socialist city was shaped by cultural modernity, industrialization, technological progress, and advancing divisions of labor. However, the particular character of the socialist, political, and economic organization steered these general processes of societal development through its backwaters.

Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania, Status of Media in

Peter Gross, in Encyclopedia of International Media and Communications, 2003

Timothy Garton Ash once remarked that the nations between the Elba and Prut rivers, those labeled Eastern or Central European and Balkan, went from a state of “normal abnormality” before 1989 to one of “abnormal normality” after that eventful year when the region's Marxist–Leninist regimes were toppled. Nowhere is this characterization of societal life in all of its facets truer for the pre- and post-1989 eras than in the Balkan states of Albania, Bulgaria, and Romania.

In these nations, there was no recorded instance of any uprising against, and no organized opposition to, the Communist regimes, that is, not until the very end of the Communist era. There was no underground press, except for rare instances of individual attempts to disseminate anti-Communist messages. The Communist media were more thoroughly controlled by censorship and self-censorship than in other European Communist countries, even if the media's use for mobilization, propaganda, disinformation, and manipulation were akin to that found throughout the Communist world. Never quite perfectible, the totalitarian experience in the region was nevertheless more complete, with oppression, fear, and poverty more accentuated than in the rest of the Communist camp. The Stalinist rule of Hoxa, Zhivkov, and Ceausescu was more paranoid than that of the Polish, Hungarian, Czechoslovak, and East German rulers, and the cult of personality dominated. History and culture—that is, the individual conception of the self, the views regarding relationships with authority and other individuals, and the collective Weltanschauung (their extant social-psychological values, attitudes, and behavior)—also conspired to accentuate and aggravate the purgatory established by Marxism–Leninism.

Bulgarians, Romanians, and Albanians, in that order, were the last of the Soviet satellite countries to shake off the yoke of communism. In Romania, unlike in the rest of the region, communism's demise was a bloody one, an event whose protagonists are still not all clearly identified and whose verifiable details await discovery. Thanks to the already mentioned absence of organized opposition to the Communist regimes, there were few if any groups and leaders to step into the void left by the Communists' departure from the helm of the three countries. The economies of the three nations, even less viable than those of their Communist neighbors, and the presence of historically undemocratic—even anti-democratic—cultures that were more negatively affected by the Communist era, also weigh heavily on the three nations. Consequently, the Albanian, Bulgarian, and Romanian post-1989 evolutions continue to be slower and more tortured than those of the former Communist nations of Central Europe.

It is in this milieu that the media systems and journalism, the focus of this article, evolved after 1989. The history of this evolution during the 1989–2000 era reveals more commonalities than differences as well as continuous changes. In general, the nations in question share strong similarities in the speed and level of foreign media investments made since 1989, the nature of their media systems, their assigned and self-assigned roles, the journalism practiced, and the laws governing them (but not always their application). They also share a common struggle to increase press freedom, access to information, and protection of journalists.

Undeniably, given their starting point, they also share a relative degree of achieved progress in the media and related fields. The differences are indeed cultural and are ones of degree and speed of change in the system, roles, journalism, and the rules and regulations governing media, journalism, and journalists.

Last but not least, the post-1989 media of these three Balkan nations share yet another commonality: save for the existence of television and the augmented radio outlets, the post-Communist media are in many ways very similar to those of the pre-Communist era. That is, the newspapers are, with few exceptions, partisan and politicized, and the journalism practiced by all media is, on the whole, opinion based. Literacy in all three countries is higher during the post-Communist period than it was during the pre-Communist one. Book publishing is well established if not extensive, the number of movie theaters is relatively high, and there is a film industry where none or a very limited one existed during the pre-Communist period. In addition, modern technology at least promises a future communications superhighway. The differences between the pre-Communist and Communist eras and the post-Communist period rest in the existence of a plethora of journalism training programs, mostly of questionable quality and benefit. The same is true of foreign-sponsored training programs that proliferated like wildfires after 1989. More important for the post-1989 media systems of Albania, Bulgaria, and Romania, for their media laws, journalism, and journalists, they are now part of a global system, with all of its attended benefits and drawbacks.Read more

Post-Socialist Cities

L. Sýkora, in International Encyclopedia of Human Geography, 2009

Centrally Planned Economy

An economy in which the allocation of resources and investments is decided by the hierarchically organized decision-making system with the main power held by the central administration (alternative term is ‘command economy’).

Specific, temporarily, existing type of transitional city characterized by the adaptation of inherited socialist urban environment to new political and economic conditions given by the political, economic, and cultural transformations to capitalism.

Post-Socialist Transition

A broad, complex, and lengthy process of societal change starting with the refusal of communist regimes and central planning, leading to democratic political regimes and a market economy.

‘State Socialism’ or ‘Communism’

A societal system characterized by the common ownership of the means of production and the administrative allocation of resources. Because of the totalitarian nature of communist regimes, the term ‘socialism’ is sometimes replaced by the terms state ‘socialism’ or ‘communism’.

A specific type of city significantly shaped by socialist political and economic regimes.

Spontaneous Transformations

Transformations of economic, social, and cultural environments that develop spontaneously within the context of democratic policymaking and international market economy.

Systemic Transformations

Government-controlled transformations of political and economic system, such as the establishment of democratically elected political representations, institutional de-regulation, price liberalization, privatization of state assets, and liberalization of foreign trade.

Transformation Processes

Transition consists of multiple transformation processes that are related in certain time sequence, address universal or more specific areas, and include both the political application of normative concepts as well as spontaneously proceeding societal changes within (re)established market environment.Read more

The Overthrow of Communism

While atypical of revolutions in many respects – for example, in their restorative character (Ash, 2009) – the uprisings that overthrew Communist regimes did involve mass uprisings from below, as well as a shift in the founding basis of state power and the accompanying ideology that had rationalized one-party rule. On the other hand, it was not entirely clear that the social basis of power had been fundamentally transformed, at least not in the ways envisioned by those who heralded these transitions as democratic revolutions. The shifts from centrally planned to market economies were often accomplished by opaque and corrupt processes of privatization, leaving concentrations of market power in the hands of the old party and state elites. In the former Yugoslavia, the collapse of the federal state was accompanied by the rise of ultranationalist demagogues and massive ethnic violence. The breakup of the former Soviet Union saw the emergence of corrupt and repressive autocracies in some of the Central Asian and Baltic states, violent conflict over ethnic separatist movements in Chechnya and Georgia, and in Russia itself a new centralization of power and restriction of liberties by Vladimir Putin through his United Russia party. Given these medium-term outcomes, it was debatable whether the uprisings that overthrew Communist regimes should be classified as revolutions, much less democratic revolutions.Read more

Ideology and the Commercialization of Book Publishing in China

Qidong Yun, in China's Publishing Industry, 2019

4.1 China’s Shaky Ideology before the Economic Reform

Ideology, as many have demonstrated (Freeden, 2007; Eagleton, 1991; Griffin, 2007), is a difficult word to define. It is beyond the scope of this chapter to review this definitional debate in detail, but it is important to have a working definition of this controversial concept before any sensible discussion about it could proceed. Thompson’s critical conceptualization of ideology as a symbolic form which “serves to establish and sustain relations of domination” (Thompson, 1990: 58) is a good starting point in the present context. Ideology, in the case of communist countries, often refers to the explicit and systemic political and economic doctrines officially upheld by the Party to legitimize its political domination and causes. Although this narrower approach may have the weakness of not being able to imply that implicit ideological propaganda is also carried out by the Party (and there may well be an increasing use of it), and ordinary, everyday media content often performs an ideological role unwittingly, I adopt this approach in this discussion for two reasons. First, despite all the transformations that have happened in China, the Party still upholds some explicit and systemic doctrines as its guiding principles, which this approach reflects well in this context. Second, my focus here is not on what exactly the Party ideology is, but rather on the shift of the official ideology and the impact of this shift on media commercialization. This approach has a relatively clear boundary, which minimizes possible confusions in this discussion.

Ideology usually played a crucially important role in the politics of communist regimes, and political systems like these were even called “ideocracy” (White, 1999). Communist ideology can be regarded as a “totalistic” ideology (Schwarzmantel, 2008: 7) as it is “all encompassing and prescribes a ‘politically correct’ view about everything from the origin of the universe to hairstyles” (Fu, 1994: 180). As a consequence it left only a narrow space for the Party to adapt its policies according to different political situations. The resulting inflexibility can be seen as an inherent weakness of communist ideology. In addition, the personality cult common in communist countries invested the predominant Party figure with the status of paramount ideological leader. This also contributed to the inflexibility of communist ideology, since ideological divergence may endanger the personal authority of the Party leader, a factor which partly explains the endemic purges within the Party on ideological grounds in many communist countries.

As communist states usually derive their policy legitimacy from the official ideology, variations or shifts of policy are usually manifested first in ideological debates. If the communist ideology was convincing to many people within and without the Party at the beginning of the People’s Republic, it gradually became shaky even during the Maoist period. There were several reasons for this.

First, as it was usually unavoidable for the party-state to adjust its domestic policies in response to changed circumstances, it was difficult for the party-state to maintain a consistent official ideology to justify completely different policies. Before the economic reform, there were already ideological debates and policy shifts in the economic field in China. The Maoist radical model of economic development differed from the orthodox Leninist model favored by other Party leaders (Schram, 1974: 43). The disastrous Great Leap Forward initiated by Mao became a focus of dispute among the higher echelons of the Party resulting in purges as Mao struggled to maintain his authority. However, following the Great Leap Forward, there were series of policy adaptations aimed at resolving the economic crisis it had created, which “led to a widening gulf between Maoist ideology and Party practice in policy implementation” (Ahn, 1973: 300). The reassertion of Maoist policy in the chaotic Cultural Revolution resulted in massive purges within the Party on ideological grounds. Economic policies such as “(m)aterial incentives, autonomy for enterprises, the encouragement of competition, pricing goods according to the real cost of production” were all judged unacceptable on ideological grounds and terminated (Gittings, 1989: 107). The vacillations of Party policies and the constant purges on ideological grounds during the Cultural Revolution weakened the credibility of the Party ideology.

Second, communist countries often diverged in their economic and political policies, especially foreign policies, which made it nearly impossible to maintain a coherent ideology across the communist bloc. This was clearly manifested in the Sino-Soviet split and the ensuing ideological debates between these two core members of the bloc. For example, Mao did not altogether approve of Khrushchev’s denunciation of Stalin because he saw it as potentially endangering his own personality cult in China and as repudiating “aspects of Soviet past” which he regarded as worthy of celebration (Schram, 1974: 38). The divergence of foreign policy between the Soviet Union and China was another example of ideological conflict. While the Soviet Union in the 1960s promoted peaceful coexistence between the communist bloc and capitalist states, China under Mao opposed this policy and called for revolutionary struggle in the Third World (Schurmann, 1968). The Sino-Soviet split created an ideological dilemma for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) since it had previously praised the Soviet Union as the first socialist state (ibid: 43). These disagreements between communist states, coupled with the vacillations of Party policies and the constant purges on ideological grounds during the Cultural Revolution, eventually brought the infallibility of the Party ideology into question.Read more
