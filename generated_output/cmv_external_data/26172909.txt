Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass service has over 100 games for subscribers to try, which includes a wide range of titles. Microsoft categorizes the games into specific sections, allowing users to find the kind of game they're wanting to play at the time. One such category is Family Friendly, which features a variety of Xbox Game Pass titles that can be played by the whole family due to a general lack of violent or inappropriate content.

It's unclear if Microsoft will ever move forward with the rumored Xbox Game Pass family plans or not, but regardless, there are still plenty of Family Friendly games available on the service. Game sharing means it's possible for families to play these games together on separate Xbox consoles while still only paying for one Game Pass account, plus many of the Family Friendly games also support local multiplayer and co-op options as well.

Many great games can be found under the Family Friendly category for Xbox Game Pass, with these five proving to be especially entertaining.

With the incredible work Playground Games has done on the Forza Horizon franchise, it's no surprise that Microsoft moved to acquire the studio for its Xbox Game Studios family. Forza Horizon 4, the latest title from Playground Games, is one of the highest-rated racing games currently available, allowing players to complete a wide variety of races in a gorgeously rendered open world. Forza Horizon 4 has Xbox Series X enhancements to take into account as well, making it a no-brainer for hardcore Xbox fans looking for a fun racing game to play with their family.

If one takes the time to play Forza Horizon 4 through Xbox Game Pass, they will quickly realize why so many Xbox fans are excited at the prospect of Playground Games developing the next Fable game. It's been confirmed that a new Fable is in active development by the studio, with the project aiming for release on Microsoft's next-generation Xbox Series X console. Whenever the new Fable comes out, fans can look forward to it being made a part of the Xbox Game Pass service as well, though considering the subject matter of previous Fable games, it may not necessarily be a family friendly title like Forza Horizon 4.

One of the perks of an Xbox Game Pass subscription is that it allows players to access games across a variety of generations. This includes brand new Xbox Series X games, as well as games from the original Xbox, Xbox 360, and Xbox One eras. One of the original Xbox games included in the Game Pass lineup is Fuzion Frenzy, a party game that served as a launch title for the Xbox back in 2001.

A 4-player party game, Fuzion Frenzy is essentially Xbox's answer to Mario Party. Players can compete with friends in a variety of different mini-games, and while aspects of it may be very dated by today's standards, it's still held in high regard by many Xbox fans.

Perhaps the most significant family friendly game available to play through Xbox Game Pass is Minecraft. The worldwide phenomenon, Microsoft's acquisition of Mojang and the Minecraft brand means that players can easily access the game through Game Pass. Minecraft supports local multiplayer and co-op options, plus online for up to eight players in a single world. Players can work together with friends to see how long they can last in Survival mode, or they can turn on Creative and try to build the most impressive creations possible. Minecraft is good for hours of enjoyment for both kids and adults alike.

Ori and the Will of the Wisps

Both Ori games are critically-acclaimed, must-play Xbox games, but Ori and the Will of the Wisps may have a slight edge over its predecessor. Ori and the Will of the Wisps is, like its predecessor, an emotionally-charged Metroidvania game with a big focus on platforming. One of the highest-rated new video game releases of 2020, Ori and the Will of the Wisps is one of the best family friendly games available to Xbox Game Pass subscribers.

Rare Replay is an incredible collection of some of Rare's best games through the country's history, and it's full of family friendly titles. There's a ton of variety here, as Rare Replay includes classic 3D platformers like Banjo-Kazooie as well as Zelda-like adventure games like Kameo: Elements of Power and even a pinata life simulation game in the form of the Viva Pinata titles. There are some games in Rare Replay that are certainly not for children, like Conker's Bad Fur Day, but otherwise the collection is full of high quality games with wide appeal.

Those impressed by Rare Replay may be tempted to try the studio's most recent offering, Sea of Thieves. Sea of Thieves is another family friendly game available to play through Xbox Game Pass for those interested, and at some point down the line, Rare will be launching the brand new IP Everwild, which also looks like it will find itself in the Family Friendly category on Xbox Game Pass.
