PIP: The problem of untimely termination of pregnancy has concerned not only doctors but protagonists of philosophy, psychology, technology, and sociology. In Czechoslovakia the number of abortions has been around 100,000/year since 1957 when the law allowed induced abortion. In 1986 this number increased by 19,000. With the introduction of mini-interruptions dangerous sequelae decreased significantly. Some female journalists have frequently stated the right of women to abortion as a basic human right. The problem of the unborn child centers around the question of potential life and its rights. According to Roman law unborn children did not have equal rights with living children. The Czechoslovak civil code protects the rights of children as long as they are born live, but there is not right to life of the unborn child. The fetus is classified in 4 possible categories: 1) its status is that of the human individual; 2) the fetus constitutes a human being only to the sum of tissues and organs; 3) it is the lowest stage of human life in an evolutionary sense; 4) and it is a self-contained, definitive entity. Under this definition no one has the right to injure the integrity of the fetus. Some members of highly esteemed European medical institutes, particularly Professor Smith of Germany in 1191 stated that the most important moment of the creation of the human being was the actual assembly of chromosomes at nidation. The essence of human form was already present in zygotes. At present there are 190,000 abortions for 10 million inhabitants. Lately the Ministry of Health has proposed to restrict abortions. The Czech Catholic bishops condemning induced abortion welcomed this initiative. Yet ban or restriction would increase the number of criminal abortions and elevate maternal mortality. The solution lies in the improvement of the health system contraceptives, and sex education.
