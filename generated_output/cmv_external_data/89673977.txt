Can we respect other people's religion?

THIS IS ACTUALLY GETTING TIRING.

so, i was on tiktok and there was a hinduism video of lord ganesha, i go into the comments to say something about it and its just filled with little immature kids making fun of my God. I clearly dont let it slide and defand my god, and one of the christans that were making fun of my God were being serverly disrespectful and told me to change my religon DISRESPECTFULLY and told me that my God is a stupid elephant and i cant do anything, they also said they find my "hindu elephant god" funny..

Unfortunately this is the worst i have gone through on tiktok, but it isn't the first nor the last. I go through this a lot, i have had many arguments with christians (not bashing christians., but its literally only them who disrespects my religion.)

Stop reading TikTok comments.

Any post on any religion on TikTok will be filled with vile crap if you scroll enough.

This is the only advice op needs. Dont engage, dont read.

I fear the day we meet aliens, is the day we find out they judged us by the "most popular" media...

We better start blasting philosophy into space or we're doomed!

thats a good point. i'll take your advice

My point is just why expose yourself to negativity when you don't need to?

that is true, thank you for your advice

Better advice is to stop going on tiktok at all. Reddit is already bad enough, but tiktok is super harmful in many ways.

You have to stop reading the comments on videos/shorts like these. They have always been, are now, and will always be filled with the worst of humanity. The comments sections on most unmoderated videos related to religion and politics are cesspools beyond all hope of saving.

Anybody who calls Ganesha a "stupid elephant" is an ignorant, bigoted moron who does not deserve one second of your time, let alone hours of your emotional energy. Your god is beautiful, and that fact utterly transcends the incoherent vitriol spewed by sad little bigots on TikTok.

everything you said in the second paragraph is a big W

Fellow Hindu here, and a devotee of the Lord of Obstacles. That stuff doesn't bother me one iota, because I know the value of His darshan, and don't listen to stuff being generated from the world of ignorance.

HistoricalLinguistic

If I may ask, what does darshan mean exactly? Wikipedia describes it as "an "auspicious sight" of a holy person, which bestows merit on the viewer", but I'm curious to what it means in practice

It has several understandings, but generally it's considered the sacred energy, vibration, that an adherent can feel coming from a temple, a holy person, etc. For many, it can be life-changing. Some people can feel it while others can't. I have a secular friend who came with me to the Ganesha temple I attend and his first question, after the ceremony, was "Does your religion believe in some sort of energy?"

At the same time I have Hindu friends who can't feel it, and wonder what the fuss is about. Hope that helps.

HistoricalLinguistic

Very cool! Thanks for explaining it to me. it actually sounds somewhat similar to my religion's concept of "feeling the holy spirit", which is usually tied to the presence of God, especially while reading scriptures, praying, participating in religious ritual, worshipping in religious buildings, or visiting other holy sites.

I think the main difference would be that with darshan, the source of it is quite evident, although perhaps not to an outsider. That's why 'sight' is included in the dictionary.

I have experienced the same hate for Hinduism from Muslims and Christians all over the internet

Be it Reddit, YouTube, or other Discussion forums

Especially about Cow Urine, don't know why they have the perspective that every Hindu drinks cow urine (I have never drunk and probably won't in my life)

I also heard the criticism about cow urine and feces used by Indians, but it is usually racist rhetoric against the people, not against Hindu religion. In fact it seems some racist pagan whites also admire que "aryan nature" of Hinduism.

I mean there are muslims who died recently from drinking their seyhs urine and eat his poop. I dont think they get to make fun of Hindus anymore

You should stop using TikTok, it’s generally filled with vile filth like that.

And it pushes it because profits > anything else. Kind of like the rest of social media.

Also it’s a Chinese company, I now doubt that ccp deliberately pushes polarising content online to shape their own narratives

TikTok is not the place to go if you’re looking for respect.

It’s TikTok. What did you expect? There is no point in arguing with literal children. Just block them or ignore it. People have their opinions technically and although their very rude, they are allowed to say that online. I get comments all the time because I’m pagan. I just ignore it. Cause it’s mainly from kids anyway. Or really old people lol

Keep in mind that the nature of social media will tend to funnel controversy and hostility into any topic. The point of social media is to focus attention. And disagreement focuses things like a treat. And the more immature it is the more attention it gets.

It's TikTok what did you expect?

I think that if such entities as "Gods" even exist, they wouldn't really care if us puny humans made any positive or negative remarks about them. Relax, it's just dumb people, don't waste your time on them.

There is a very easy solution to this. Don't use Tiktok

Ignore them, for it's a waste of your time. It's an important emphasis by a lot of Hindu sampradays to be unaffected by external comments and feelings. These comments are done on the purpose of offending people. If you don't bat an eye to them, it fails their purpose, as you'd have heard the Sanakrit phrase Vinaashakale vipareethabuddhi. Its these comments like these which personally make me cling more to my religion.

I would just ignore it. There are always going to be people like that and something about the internet brings out the worst in people.

A true Christian would never insult other religions because God calls us to love others. I respect your God. Actually one of my best friends follows Hinduism.

thank you very much, i wasnt aiming it at all christans but moreover THOSE christans, my best friend is christan actually, and she is NOT like this.

Many christians don't read their book anymore. There are many verses that teach against this mindset. In fact the entire NT, in it's essence, is against such behaviour. But people need to pay attention and apply what they understand or are reading.

It takes a long time, and it seems like initially such comments have power. And they do, to cause harm. But in time, as you realise that the filth, belittling, and mockery in their own mouths actually belong to them, these things start to have no effect. But it takes a long time. Not only to realise this, but to actually just not care anymore about the crp people say. At the end of the day, they will have to handle and bear their own load. It especially hurts when the people are close. Of course, the actual teaching, is to learn to take spite and hate without giving it back in return. That is, to live spiritually in the face of hatred. I know that Buddhism has such ideas, I think hindusim too, but I am not sure.

There is a verse "Men will have to give an account for every idle word." This means, in one sense, that if we treat people badly, and say rude things, at the end of the day, we still have to clean our own house, and learn to undo all the harm we have done [not only to others, but actually, to our own inner nature]. The more rubbish and hatred in all it's various forms that we spew out over the years, the more work that is required later to actually to go down a genuine spiritual path, not just a fictitious one. The more a person entrenches themselves in such behaviours, the harder they are to undo or remove later from our personalities.

So ya, just try ignore that stuff. Just block off communication. It does take some effort.

thank you for your kind words.

Stop watching tik tok.

My words exactly 🥂

Astral-Watcherentity

I'm not a Hindu practitioner, but I am an omnist, and here's my take:

I'm sorry to hear about your experiences on TikTok and the disrespect you've encountered towards your beliefs and Lord Ganesha. It's deeply unfortunate when discussions about faith turn into disrespectful and hurtful encounters. Everyone's beliefs, whether Hinduism, Christianity, or any other faith, deserve respect and understanding.

In an ideal world, there would be mutual respect for all religions and spiritual paths. Every faith has its own beauty, wisdom, and unique perspectives that contribute to the rich tapestry of human spirituality. Disrespecting someone else's beliefs not only causes unnecessary pain but also closes off the opportunity to learn from each other's traditions and experiences.

It's important to remember that the actions of a few individuals don't represent an entire religion. While you've had negative experiences with some Christians, many Christians believe in and practice respect for all faiths. Similarly, in every religion, there are individuals who may not represent the core teachings of love, respect, and compassion that are central to most spiritual paths.

In such situations, it can be helpful to engage in dialogue with a spirit of understanding, or sometimes, to disengage if the conversation becomes too disrespectful or hurtful. Protecting your peace and emotional well-being is important.

Lastly, remember that your faith and your relationship with your deities are personal and sacred. The disrespectful comments of others can not diminish the beauty and validity of your beliefs. As an Omnist perspective appreciates, every religion holds its own truth and beauty, deserving of respect and honor.

thank you for your understanding, i agree with you, i think that the world having so many religons and cultures is beautiful, i have no problems with christans and christianity, its just whenever my religon is disrespected, i just know its a christans cause every other religon minds their buisness.

I've also noticed that there are a lot of anti-Hindu comments found on TikTok. Unfortunately a lot of it comes from Muslims and Christians (more so Muslims, a lot of them seem to come from Pakistanis probably because of the whole India vs Pakistan stuff). In a similar manner, I've also seen a lot of Hindus leave Islamaphobic comments on YouTube.

It's unfortunate, but as other comments have said it's mostly just dumb kids commenting so don't take it so seriously.

Exactly. We should all learn to get along and respect each other’s beliefs. Lots of folks bashing other religions and wants to engage in a very toxic setting.

No drama about other subreddits or redditors here or elsewhere...for example, "Look at what the mods at (insert subreddit here) deleted!" or "This redditor at (insert subreddit here) is a joke!".

I mean, TikTok is a cesspool-by-design pretty much regardless of topic. Their algorithm clearly loves "engagement", which in practice mostly means "flame wars".

Now tack on that a certain brand of evangelical Christians seems to beat (probably not literally) any sense of human decency out of their kids, there's less than a snowflake's chance in stereotypical Christian fiery hell of anything to do with religion the algorithm actually pushes having a constructive comments section.

Not that other social media are much, if any, better. Reddit's arguably worse. You just found a rare gem of a sub here with moderators that truly moderate, rather than doing nothing or power tripping like a US mall cop.

I think I found your problem

I went on there once, start browsing the Satanism, then demonology, then witchcraft forums.. Jesus that rabbit hole sucked me in, hour after hour watching the most insane things being touted as reality, interspersed with liysynching and stupid videos of kids pointing at text that would pop up on screen as if mtv pop up videos was a new version of the history channel, another hour went by and I seriously though I might just have lost faith in humanity. It was the tranwreck scenario where I just couldn't stop looking.. I finally pulled myself back and looked at the clock. 4 minutes had passed. Fuck that drug, that was awful

Lesson is ignore morons emulated morons who constantly over-act, spit out "I just thought of this and it's deep" rhetoric, and just downright mental illness on display for other lonely teens to emulate thinking that is whats popular.

not bashing christians., but its literally only them who disrespects my religion.

It do seem that way right? Just keep in mind it is the overwhelming majority, and the larger the data set, the larger the amount of retards slip in.

thank you for understanding me, but i saw that you are a satanist, and i hate to ask but i have a question, what do you guys believe in?

I wish I could actually tell you, but it seems "satanism" has become worse than saying "I believe in god".

For me and those in my group, we follow the old Canaanite gods and goddesses, Ba'al, Astarte, El, Asherah, etc.. while accepting the demonization that modern religion pushed onto them.

Take the God Ba'al, we see that even after monotheism tried to stamp out the old ways, still remained relevant through first, counter coulter, and then into the occult. Beelzebub in the Goetia is the King of Demons, which is interesting since he was the King of the gods, and all those gods were later considered demons. All the way up to 1928 when Ugarit was rediscovered and the gods and goddesses were again worshiped under the revivalis tNatib Qadish.

So basically, it's Left-hand path (read: all paths since left, right, and center. none are off limits) pre Abrahamic poly theism

I would say that "most" theistic Satanists are reall just pre abrahamic poly theists, but the distinction lies in the accepting of the demon moniker. Demon after all comes from greek Daemon, as in Eudaemonia which as Plato put it, was the highest good you could reach, a place of ultimate "zen" if he knew the word.

I actually own a couple books about Ugaritic texts and commentary. Yes, I'm a Christian, but I find it imperitive to understand how different religions relate to people differently and how they developed. It's unfortunate that some Christians tend to get so ruffled by people who believe differently.

Religion of Islam does not allow disrespecting/insulting the Gods of other people.

Quran : al-An‘aam 6:108

"And insult not those whom they (disbelievers) worship besides Allah, lest they insult Allah wrongfully without knowledge. Thus, we have made fair seeming to each people its own doings; then to their Lord is their return and He shall then inform them of all that they used to do”

From these verses it is clearly drawn that such a practice in Islam is forbidden.

I am genuinely so sorry those Christians treated you like they did. It was wrong, even if someone doesn’t agree with someone else’s religion. It doesn’t kill someone to be kind.

thats what im saying. its mainly "tiktok christans' which is what i call them, litterly if you wanna see a toxic christan just go on tiktok, you will find one within a minute

Oh, I have seen them.

Everything I read about TikTok makes it clear that it’s a toxic cesspool. It just brings out the worst in assholes.

Muslim here I’ve encountered Islamophobia before best to just ignore what they’re saying about Hinduism and just live your own life

Social media is a dark place where the worst of humanity is often on full display. The best advise has already been said. Don't read the comments or engage. It's very hard to do. As a pagan my faith is often mocked and disrespected as well. It is a shared struggle we both face.

Your frustration is justified, absolutely, but nothing good comes of trying to engage with people already acting in bad faith. If I may, something that helps me to put my focus away from such people when I see them, comes from a work of traditional wisdom presented as the words of Odin, the chief God of my faith:

121. ...never in speech with a foolish knave shouldst thou waste a single word. 122. From the lips of such thou needst not look for reward of thine own good will; but a righteous man by praise will render thee firm in favour and love.

I mediate on it whenever I feel the need to reply. Finding something like that in your own faith I think may help. Stay strong.

Uninstall TikTok. It is a net negative for humanity, and a net positive for nobody but the CCP.

Your first mistake was taking anything on tik tok seriously

Grouchy-Magician-633

As an Omnist, My philosophy is that all religions have value/lessons and should be respected as well as be respectful to each other. Unfortunately, you will always find jerks like the ones you've described in any religion. Humans will be humans ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Honestly, try to avoid TikTok, its just a swamp of hate and bigotry. And not just when it comes to religion.

Can we respect others’ religion? Yes. Of course we can. Here’s my line: if it’s a dangerous cult like the Jim Jones kind, then no, no respect there.

If I had $0.05 for every time someone complains about toxicity, and then it turns out they were on a shithole site like Twitter or TikTok when it happened...

I agree. I've always said this, you can't just say to someone 'Your beliefs are wrong.' or 'You must convert.' , if someone beliefs are different from yours, you should respect their beliefs and move on. I'm Agnostic and I'm going towards converting to a Christian and I am honestly surprized that these kids, despite being Christian, know nothing about respect and Hinduism. Your religion is beautiful, I respect it, and I find it interesting.

thank you for your kind words, i love having a respectful christan around

Your welcome. I need to say what's right.

Don't let it bother you to much. Especially if it's name calling and childish insults. I'll definitely debate someone if they're trying to make a false assertion about my religion though.

Well, they're children and they act as children. Obviously adults can be this way as well, however if they acted that way it just shows their own immaturity that is based on fear and hate of the other.

These kids were probably saying things specifically to hurt you or upset you just to get a reaction from you. It probably had very little to do about Lord Ganesh as they don't know Lord Ganesh.

This can be applied to all religions, but I will word it in a way specified to your example.

Lord Ganesha does not become any less real merely because ignorant people whine. He is far above such petty energy, which is why he's a God. Those of us who have worked with or communicated with him know, and experience is not undone by mere words from the inexperienced. It would be unreasonable for us to silence every instance of critical speech towards our deities because it has no merit or substance besides ignorance, and the only person worse off is the speaker. Not you, not Hindus, not religious people more generally, and certainly not Lord Ganesha.

You wouldn't get offended by someone who is constantly claiming the sky is green, at best you'd feel sorry for them for not being aware of a truth you behold, a truth that obviously won't become any less true no matter how much they say the opposite.

So, the level of respect will change depending on people, but on the fundamental level, no.

How can you respect someone else beliefs if your beliefs implies that they are crazy, indoctrinated or possessed by demons to harm others and so on.

Beliefs regarding religion implies some beliefs about other peoples beliefs about religion, and that would make respect on the intrinsic level impossible. Of course, people could try to behave but that doesn't mean that they won't see you as something harmful or inferior or well, simply deluded.

And regarding the behaving, well.. for one side, you have some religions that require a lot of hostility towards others, by defining them as lesser, or people to convert, or another weird thing. On the other, you have a lot of history of groups fighting each other that can cause a lot of aggressive feelings.

So, while the attitude can change depending on the environment (and by all means, as other said, stop reading tik tok comments please). The main problem would not be solved, at least not in environments where people hold those beliefs as something important to them.

I've witnessed this in my friend circle :).

Some online Muslim friend tried to make fun of my Indian friend degrading them as cow piss drinker and make fun of their accent. Was an eye opening moment. Thought the Muslim was nice overall, but then THAT happened and idk.

Its not about the religion per se maybe? Maybe the upbringing and surrounding, the way they're taught to look down on and degrate others they look down on. They as in any people any religion and culture who shit talk and are racists against other groups of people.

I don't understand these people. Why are they on the internet anyway, should be buys praying to their loving God (s) instead.

I'm so sorry for your experience. I know how it feels to be attacked like that. Please block these and try to ignore these people, cuz they aren't themselves at peace with their God.

in a good world, yes but in this world, no. religion has caused actual war in the past. someone is always going to think their religion is the correct one over other peoples religions. it won’t ever stop

I'm sorry to hear about that. That is understandably frustrating.

Religion is meant to help us be our best selves. I don't know how to exactly, but maybe you can show those people how you are your best self via your example or some other way.

People will be people, it's not the religion, as in being Christian, talking, it's their true heart and ignorance, and you can find these types of people anywhere in and out of religion.

All this is about you, learn to be at peace regardless of what people may say, your faith is your faith, you don't have to defend it to anyone that has no respect for others.

By getting upset you would only show them that what they do works on you... Elevate yourself and if anything, if that's a thing in your religion, pray for them, even though they mock you.

This is straight up false. Evangelical Christians are absolutely like this. They take pride in shitting on other religions because they think it makes people want to be like them. I was raised in the Southern Baptist churches and 95% of the people I grew up with would act like this too.

Op is talking about Christians, and was not specific to 'evangelical' Christian which is different, but even if so, it is always a problem to generalize, there are good and bad people in any culture, religions and out of it. And for the bad ones in religion, it's not the religion per se that is bad, it's their heart and character... If they didn't believe, they could still mock and be hurtful to others.

As for your personal experience, even if 95% are like that, that would confirm there are still 5% around you that are not like that, so if anything, learn from those ones, because these are the ones that actually follow the teachings of Christ, he was never mocking nor belittling anyone, a servant to the world...

In Jesus the scripture is true when he says...

True and False Disciples

21“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. 22Many will say to me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?’ 23Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!’

I think this post serves more as an outlet to express your bottled up emotions, cuz Im sorry, but bigotry will exist as long as humans exist. Beliefs, opinions, experiences, views, these all divide people everywhere. Its wishful thinking to hope that everyone in world will someday learn to get along, respect each others views, and stop arguing etc.

These questions were very disrespectful given the context of the post. "Gotcha" questions attempting to convince others that their religion is wrong are not welcome here.

Please thoroughly review the rules and guidelines: https://www.reddit.com/r/religion/comments/qh9xr4/updated_october_2021_new_to_rreligion_please_read/

There was a theologian called James Fowler. He proposed a developmental theory called the Stages of Faith. Those at lower levels see things in absolutes, black and white, right and wrong. If you are different from them, you are just incorrect. Those at higher stages can hold ideas a little lighter, see subtleties and nuance, appreciate shared values even with those of different faiths.

This theory has helped me a lot in understanding how conversations go.

I also happen to think this theory is applicable to all belief systems, not just religious. Political, economic, even sports fans! Deeply held beliefs will track with these levels.

So fret not. Just find some stage 4+ people to chit chat with. 🙂

Grow up and this won't be a problem

Try to follow TikTok channels that discuss religion with some seriousness, which, given the variety of information, is not easy. Then filter what interests you the most.

Regarding respect for other religions, I think you might be referring to ecumenism. This leads us to a much deeper discussion about the openness or closure of religions to dialogue and the sharing of beliefs. If I'm wrong about interpreting your words, please be more specific.
