Is it possible to respect religious beliefs you don't believe in?

I'm an agnostic counseling student, and one week, we had a discussion regarding respecting everyone's beliefs, regardless of our own, and I just don't think that's possible.

I can respect your right to have those beliefs.

I can respect you, despite the fact you hold beliefs I see as illogical.

I can accept the fact you hold those beliefs.

But could I respect them? I could feign respect by not debating you and tone policing myself, but I think not believing in a concept is about as disrespectful as I could possibly be toward it. If I respected your religion, I would be at your church every Sunday.

ETA: And I could say the same for religious people. How could they possibly genuinely respect the philosophy that their God being real is anything but undeniably true? They can be nice to me, maybe agree to disagree. But deep down, how could they find what I'm proposing not to be absolutely asinine if I'm denying something so painfully obvious? Share

Depends on what both parties agree is respect.

The atheist who sits quietly while a Christian is on their knees in prayer is respectful. No at no point would the atheist have to agree, pray or confirm the Christian in their prayer. All of this should be respectful for both parties.

What's often the issue is that the Christian will try and push their religion into the atheist, at that point it would be equally as respectful to reject and denounce the Christian.

So yes, I respect the billions of people who have religion in their life. Up until on of them loses they respect by forcing me to follow along their religious beliefs.

Then they know I'm an atheist and attempt bullying by saying they'll pray for me. Hail fucking satan

Name a point in time when it wasn't happening. Why continue to respect it? Your perspective is incredibly idealistic and historically implausible. I wish it were so simple.

When what wasn't happening? Christians trying to push their religion onto others? All the time. But it's up to each and every Christian to lose basic respect be violating that trust.

Condemning entire groups because of the actions of most is what zealots do.

Condemning entire groups because of the actions of most

seems like a perfectly reasonable response to organized fuckery by said most.

No organization gets a pass on evildoing because "some" of their adherents are cool while "most" are dicks.

I'm pretty sure this is the same justification the U.S. has for invading the Middle East on a regular basis...

many Christians aren't part of any organization

I don't think not believing something inherently disrespects anyone who does believe it. Respect is really a matter of how you treat someone -- arguably, it's a greater sign of your commitment to and ability to show respect that you do this with someone you do strongly disagree with.

Well here we enter a very subjective area, the 3 points you list are, to me, the definition of respecting someone's beliefs. And I would add that pretty much everyone who says "respect everyone's beliefs" means something like that, so I don't really see the problem you refer to because pretty much no one is asking more of you.

Some "bigger" signs of respect that I do (I'm an agnostic or atheist (idk and idc))

-If people do the sign of the cross when they enter a church I follow

-If I'm at a church I am quiet, and let people do their things

-If I'm at a house where they say grace I follow as I'm able

-If someone says god bless you I say the same to them

Things like this. No need to get all pedantic and annoying and think "Oh I don't believe in god so I shouldn't do this!" just understand that things like saying grace and saying god bless you are just higher forms for religious people to wish you good, just wish them good back in their way as a sign of respect.

I’m the same. There was a sickness then death in my family a couple months ago. I had many people tell me that they were praying for me and or my family. It isn’t really my thing but I thanked them all.

I knew that it was their way of processing what was going on and wishing me well. I was glad to know people cared.

I have an acquaintance who would have probably made a scene and said things back to people about prayer being a waste or not believing. I think that is disrespectful to someone who means well.

praying for me and or my family. It isn’t really my thing but I thanked them all.

Being "non-religious" I'm honestly kind of "jealous" of this line, it's like a perfect and very awesome way of just telling someone that they are in your thoughts, that they are important enough to you that you will spend actual TIME of your days thinking of them, dedicating your consciousness to them, it's honestly quite beautiful.

And for what it's worth, from a stranger, I am sorry for your loss as well, you seem like a nice person, and it's always sad to know tragedies occur to a nice person.

I can think of other lines that are as good if not better depending on perspective.

"My heart goes out to you and your family."

"My thoughts are with you and your family."

"How are you feeling about this?"

i mean fundamentally what is "praying for" anything even mean?

I'm not even sure what it implies. Let's say there is a thing one can pray to that might be able to do something about the situation at all. ... What exactly are you praying for? What is in your actual prayer?

"I'm wishing upon a star for you and your family."

"I'll be casting a spell of hope and peace for you and your family" <---some kinda pagan shit haha.

"I'll tell the forest spirits of you and your family's woes and suffering."

"I'M CRANKING MY HOG FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY, BROTHER!!!" <-- r/THE_PACK reference lol

I consider myself loosely Christian. That is, I don’t believe you have to be Christian to go to heaven, I don’t believe you have to be baptized to go to heaven, I don’t believe you have to devote your life to God to go to heaven, my belief is pretty much just try to be a good person and you’ll go to heaven. I also don’t believe hell is eternity, I think you have to do some truly heinous shit to go to hell and then you’re only there for an amount of time relative to whatever got you sent there, and then you go to heaven.

Despite this, I respect the fact atheists don’t believe in any of it, agnostics believe there might be something but they don’t know/care what, and I respect all other religions because I have no proof I’m any more right than they are. Respect isn’t “oh yes you’re so right” it’s “well you’ve got as much reason to believe your faith as I do, we both have the same amount of proof and what we each practice doesn’t affect the other”

Not to be a jackass but you’re kinda coming off like you have a superiority complex linked to your lack of faith. Much like I said, your lack of faith doesn’t make you any smarter than me, we both have the exact same amount of proof to back up our beliefs, as in, not a single bit. Neither of us have died to see what’s after, so neither of us could believe we’re more right than the other.

There’s a reason practicing religion is called believing it and not knowing it. I don’t know there’s a god or a heaven, I choose to believe there is. Because of this I don’t find your belief that there isn’t asinine as you say, because it’s not painfully obvious.

Also important to point out, most people don’t respect other religions, they begrudgingly accept they exist. People who genuinely believe everyone has a right to a different ideology than what they believe are in the minority sadly. Most people would love to find a genie and wish everyone had the same view on religion as them, and I think that’s pretty disappointing because they’re treating it like they KNOW their view is the only right view, and not a single one of us knows. No atheist, agnostic, or theist knows 100% that their view is the correct one, and that’s the beauty of religion. It’s faith, not knowledge.

You don't believe in things out of choice.

You can't choose to stop believing something - not really.

Agree to disagree, I was atheist till around my junior year of high-school and kinda just, started believing. I didn’t have anything change, I wasn’t at some super low point in life or see the light, I just kinda started believing

You were Atheist? like fully "I do not believe a god exists"? Or more so just...didn't think about it at all.

Also nobody simply STARTS believing something for no reason. But even so - you're making it sound like it's something you caught like some kind of disease. You were just minding your business...nothing happened...and then suddenly you were like "Y'know I believe in God now."? Come on.

Like I was the kind of obnoxious kid who argued with Christian’s acting all high and mighty yknow? And I’m not saying I caught it like a disease. More so just kinda starting thinking about it and my thought process was it doesn’t make sense to me for all of this to have just happened for no reason and I leaned more towards Christianity

Yes it's absolutely possible.

If I'm speaking with a devout Christian (or Buddhist or Muslim or what-have-you) and they are telling me about what they believe, I do treat that person with respect.

Why? Because it's a big complicated world we live in, and different people are going to see it in different ways. It's like a giant mountain with Truth at the top and many different paths up that mountain. If you're walking a different path than I am, that's fine with me. We're both trying to reach the same destination. We're both just trying to understand the world.

I mean, the main part of respecting beliefs is just not being a dick towards the person with those beliefs. If some Christian or Muslim starts to try and convert you, then by all means - be a dick, since their attempts to convert are likely entirely unwanted to begin with. But, don't be like them. Don't go out of your way to tell people they're wrong, unless they invite that type of discussion to begin with.

There are fanatics in every religion but not all religious people are fanatics. I have family that are Christian. I have family that are Muslim. They all respect each others faith. So yeah, it’s possible. Just depends on the people.

I just don't think that's possible.

If you just can't be nice to people then you might need to do something about that.

I think you’re getting caught up on, you finding it illogical. When logic is also based on our specific interpretations and experiences ie if I’m with this group of people, I fit in better and will therefore be more productive in society.(obviously there’s lots of small and big leaps our brain makes when it comes too navigation choices this was just an example) Is it then illogical that someone would have specific religious beliefs, depending on their environments and background? Surely because of those factors, that would lead them to believe that said religion, is the most logical one. Just because they practice a religion does not necessarily mean they agree with all parts either.

Respect is about allowing people the space to share their opinions, in a way that can hopefully be constructive. If not then, at the very least in safety and compassion. You can have your thoughts and they can have theirs, that’s what respect is. Each side is going to find an abhorrent opinion, but as long as it’s heard with grace, rest assured it’s been respected.

If you look around at other people and at yourself you will see that illogicality is part of everyone's psyche, not just religionists.

And since you describe yourself as an agnostic, not as an atheist, you haven't ruled out the possibility of the existence of a supernatural being

Additionally, many religionists are dedicated to helping their fellow man, respect for that aspect of religion should be easy for you.

It is possible. I like to consider myself a non-denominal theist, and I respect the positives of religion while scrutinizing the negative.

You have to "believe" in things to "respect" them? How about respecting the fact that other people have different feelings than you and stop judging. If you feel like you need to feign something, you shouldn't really be a counselor. You need to have an open mind with your clients and be transparent. No room for pretending.

Take some philosophy classes. It’s all about respecting all the different philosophies. Even when they aren’t your own. Have an open mind and you can understand them without adopting them. They are all quite fascinating I think.

Shouldn't be a question. I respect all religions and refuse to debate people on their personal belief system.

Maybe change your perspective a bit. You can simply be respectful of their belief. As in not actively showing disrespect. You are using the word with the definition of “holding it in high regard”. It is as simple as not disrespecting them or simply acknowledge the fact that this is an important part of their life.

The difference is immaterial. Nobody expects you to be respectful in the way that you think, nobody cares most likely. You are expected to be respectful in the way that you behave. Affording people the space and time required to live according to their religious and spiritual beliefs. If you can remain silent during a moment of prayer, if you can accept that someone might be required to adjust their diet or dress to live according to their dogma then you are being respectful, no matter what you privately think.

It is absolutely possible.

But could I respect them? I could feign respect by not debating you and tone policing myself, but I think not believing in a concept is about as disrespectful as I could possibly be toward it. If I respected your religion, I would be at your church every Sunday.

There are many things about many religions that I respect. Perhaps you and I have different definitions of respect, I don't know.

I've met good Muslim people who were devoted to their God and their practices. This made them kind and compassionate people, and I respect them and their religion for giving them the discipline and desire to become better people.

I respect the way Buddhism teaches to love others without trying to possess or own them. To appreciate life without clinging to it in an unhealthy way.

I respect the rich tradition of Judaism. The lengths they will go to in honor of their God and the great wisdom their Rabbis willingly share that helps people (including me and I'm not Jewish) in their daily lives.

I respect the simple kindness in the teachings of Jesus Christ. That no amount of complex doctrines or long-winded ceremonies should become so convoluted that it takes us away from the simple and constant love of our neighbors.

I respect the colorful, historical, vast, and complex group of religions known as Hinduism. For being probably the best storytellers in the world. The most influential mysticism in the world. For teaching us all so much that most people don't even know they taught us.

Beliefs are stupid. No one cares what you believe any more than they care what I believe, and no one cares what I believe. The only thing that matters is what we do. There's no bad reason to be a good person.

I think you nailed it in 1, 2, and 3. Nothing more is reasonable to ask for.

I believe that believing in magical things is a form of mental illness. I can’t seem to shake this no matter how much I want to respect these people.

If one party believes in any religious beliefs AT ALL, which are subjective by nature, then they must BY LOGIC respect any and all other subjective beliefs. Those of us who can see the shit on the wall, however, are allowed to just point at it and say, "Hey, you're smearing shit on the wall. That's gross."

I respect people, not beliefs. The only thing I care about when it comes to an idea is if it's true or not

I don’t respect irrational or faith-based beliefs, and I have no good reason to. I can respect people’s right to hold those beliefs, as long as they don’t violate the rights of others, but I don’t have to respect the beliefs themselves, and I will never hold such beliefs to the same standard as facts and logic.

It might be, but there's no way of operationally defining "resoect."

This may be unpopular, but I've never bought into the idea that we have to respect anyone else's beliefs. I certainly don't, and I don't expect anyone else to respect mine. I'm sure not everyone's going to resoect my belief right here.

You have a point: my professor might have had a different definition in mind and just means I should respect the individuals and the capacity of their beliefs to benefit them therapeutically.

Yeah that makes sense. I can certainly see being cordial with others as being important. But even then, I'm typically like "let's change the subject" 🤣💀

Depends on the belief. Jewish people have the Sabbath, some follow it, some don't, some take it too far, I think, but whatever 🤷‍♂️.

But if you're christian and try to get sodomy banned by constitutional amendment, yeah, I do have a problem with that belief.

respect and tolerate are two different things.

I don't respect any religious belief, and I don't have to.

I fully respect the right of anyone to believe anything they want as long as it doesn't interfere with my personal right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

so, I fully tolerate any religious belief to the full extent that the law requires but not a millimeter further.

But that's it - beyond that, GTFO with your cult dogma.

Only Christian beliefs need to be disregarded. Every other religion is be given the utmost respect.

It's all fake. Grown ass adults believing in fairy tales then enacting laws based on fairy tales are what's wrong in America. Even Reagan knew

There are two components to religion: culture and distortion of reality

Culture is arbitrary, like language. A word only has a meaning because we say it has a meaning. Traditions, ceremonies, rituals, arts are also arbitrary. They shouldn't just be respected, but celebrated

Distortion of reality, on the other hand, is lying. We know the earth is flat and that there is no heaven in the sky. They want to believe such things because they have been taught to be afraid and because they know their social infrastructure would fall apart. So they continue to lie.

But lying is wrong. It is definitionally the absence of information, including an understanding of the consequences of our actions. If you do not know what the good decision is, then you are liable to choose the bad decisions

There is nothing about that that should be respected

Maybe, it's possible. I grew up in a very conservative Evangelical family. Everyone thought they were good saintly people, but from what I experience most used their religion as an excuse to be terrible people, and do terrible things. I was abused, beaten, and tortured by my parents who believed they spoke directly to God and were prophets. They'd have voices and dreams telling them I did something wrong, and they'd punish me without any evidence, just because God told them. I just don't believe religion is harmless. Especially Abrahamic religions. Which have been used for century to commit atrocities around the world. And continue to to this day. So I no longer automatically respect religion. I don't believe blind respect makes me a good or a moral person. It's just enabling or being complicit to me. It causes more harm than good to me.

I can accept that a good portion of Americans like country music. I do not need to respect them.

"I respect you as a person too much to respect your ridiculous beliefs."

As a counselor you need to figure this out or refuse to counsel people of faith. You will have to take beliefs of all types ( not just religious) into account when you counsel. You can and must change based on those beliefs even if you don't share them.

If you are truly agnostic, you must not think those beliefs are illogical because you either believe it is impossible to know for sure about faith issues or you are simply undecided. You would need to be an atheist to believe they are illogical.

I'm pretty surprised that you are struggling with this as a counselor. Please discuss this with your supervisor or mentor. If you simply cannot do that, please refer this client to someone who can. They deserve a counselor who respects them.

Respect goes beyond just not showing disrespect I think. The definition almost always includes a sort admiration.

I think it's possible to admire the intention and fruits of a person's beliefs that you don't share. You may wish you had those qualities for yourself but don't agree with the means.

Being conscious of and not disrespecting other's beliefs is just good manners.

The real answer is yes. The wordsmithing won't change that.

I think that often having an absolute disdain for religion is a short-sighted view. I think that religions evolved for a reason. And I think that religious thought played an integral role in human development as a species. I sometimes lose respect for people who bash on the idiocy of religion when they hold equally dogmatic and tribal ideas.

this is a normal thing for you to question in your position. i was extremely conflicted in medical school when doctors i shadowed would take part in prayers with patients and their families. i was agnostic/atheist/nonbeliever so any and all religious beliefs were in a way offensive to me as a scientific practitioner of what i knew was reproducible, evidence-based, medical science. it wasnt until several years later that i realized the absolute power of these beliefs and how much raw power i held over people whenever i pretended to share their superstitious delusions.

Yup so long as the first rule of the religion is the same as fight club and their beliefs end at their nose.

Is it possible to hate and love at the same time? Ask anyone married

I can respect your right to have those beliefs.

2. I can respect you, despite the fact you hold beliefs I see as illogical.

3. I can accept the fact you hold those beliefs.

Functionally, when would this be different from respecting their beliefs?

I respect your beliefs insofar as they do not cross with my beliefs in a way I consider potentially violence inducing.

For example; if your religious belief is that gays are bad and gays shouldn't be allowed to marry - or even if your belief is that gays are bad but it's up to god to judge them!, and I'm gay (or just not a bigot lmao) then no, I will not respect your belief. It's irrationally held AND harmful. Why is it harmful if they say they personally wouldn't want to do anything to stop gay people from being gay?

Well, because this motherfucker can vote. And who's he more likely to vote for - a pro-gay candidate or an anti-gay candidate?

Sure, the anti-gay stuff wouldn't necessarily be the drawing point - but it wouldn't be a deal breaker either necessarily. They're already biased against gay people whether they admit it or not by believing god hates them and is gonna send them all to hell lmao.

So they likely don't care much what happens to them one way or another. Which, yeah i don't respect that. Nobody should. Unless you hate gay people, too.

One can only respect a belief by respecting the person who holds the belief. Beliefs themselves do not have beliefs.

I think respect is a prerequisite to understanding. Does every one want understanding?

I honestly want to understand why atheists think what they do. I wholeheartedly disagree but i want to understand.

Same for dems, wokies, trans, gays, etc....i want to understand, therefore i respect their beliefs prima facie
