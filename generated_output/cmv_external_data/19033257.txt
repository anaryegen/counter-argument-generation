HQ Library Navigation

Benefits of Space Exploration

BOOKS AND MULTIMEDIA – E-BOOKS – PERIODICALS – INTERNET RESOURCES

One of the familiar complaints that NASA receives when its budget comes up for approval is that “…the money really ought to be spent down here instead of up there”. Leaving aside the fact that NASA’s civil servants and contractors all live here on Earth, and thus the money is spent here, NASA’s fifty years of research and development have resulted in a wide range of inventions and processes, ranging from the complexity of image processing through the simplicity of fire-resistant kid’s pyjamas.

One facet of NASA’s research, aviation safety, is a continuing legacy from NASA’s predecessor, the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics. It is so important to the public that it has a NASA HQ library webpage to itself. If you are a NASA HQ employee, please consider subscribing to our news alert on aviation safety to get the latest news.

This webpage will help you get a general overview of what NASA’s inventions and developments have done to make our lives easier. If you would like to know the paths NASA’s inventions take from lab benches to store shelves, please visit our webpage on the Diffusion of Innovations. If you would like to see how NASA’s research and development efforts aid America’s economy in dollars and cents, please visit our webpage on Measuring Return on Investment for Government Programs and Agencies. If you are interested in seeing how private industry is going forward in space, please visit our webpage on Space Commercialization and Space Tourism. If you are a NASA HQ employee, please consider subscribing to our news alert on commercialization and technology transfer to get the latest news.

All items are available at the Headquarters Library, except as noted. NASA Headquarters employees and contractors: Call x0168 or email Library@hq.nasa.gov for information on borrowing or in-library use of any of these items. Members of the public: Contact your local library for the availability of these items. NASA Headquarters employees can request additional materials or research on this topic. The Library welcomes your comments or suggestions about this webpage.
