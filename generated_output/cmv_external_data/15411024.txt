CMV: I think it is ok to have swearing in children shows.

I mean theyre just words. Swearing doesnt do any harm to anyone. Swearing is just a form of expression. I dont see what the huge deal is with swearing. I mean there's so many horrible things in the world like rape or murder but people act as though swearing is that big of a deal.

Plus i think substitutes for profanity such as heck, gosh, darn, freakin, etc sound so immature. Just say the damn word. Grow up.

Could you give an example of swearing you would find acceptable in a children's show?

I think if the show is teaching a lesson about swearing then there may be some value in that but if it's that characters should just drop F-bombs unceremoniously or say "shit" when they can substitute a softer expletive then I don't actually think there's much gained in this instance.

Children model behavior and are more susceptible to excessive mirroring than adolescents and adults. Developmentally, they literally cannot parse the world out through sophisticated lenses because they do not have the cognitive foundations. As such, allowing children to be exposed to excessive or inappropriate swearing doesn't really teach them civil behavior or model appropriate ways to interact.

I think saying positive phrases such as "fuck yeah" is ok but calling people cunts or bitches is not ok.

Is excessive swearing even a bad thing? One can be civil and swear a lot.

I would consider excessive swearing a sign of poor impulse control, ineloquence, and immaturity. In children, I would consider it worse in some regards because they don't have the full context or capability to cull in their worst impulses appropriately. Simply allowing children to be inundated with swears is just allows for worse behavior to propagate.

Swearing only has the impact it does because it's reserved for narrow circumstances while general language is more... well general. When you want to swear excessively, you're telling people something about yourself and how you conduct yourself. Otherwise that wouldn't be your word choice.

Since children are more susceptible to mirroring behavior undigested and uncritically, I think it's better to let them grow up with general civil language first and let them decide when they're older if they want to be a person who swears a lot. Once you model bad or vulgar behavior for children without any checks or balances in place, they are more likely to grow up bad or vulgar.

Whatever you said is rather true, and I cant argue with that. Yeah, youre right that kids may not be able to differentiate when is it ok to swear and when its not.

(Idk if this is long enough but I all I am trying to do is to reach the character minimum to award a delta for you).

It's not a good look. I, as well as many other people, consider excessive swearing to be a sign of someone too stupid to express themselves clearly or lack the self-control to speak thoughtfully. It's not that if you say "Fuck" everyone is going to assume you're an idiot, but children are going to mimic what they see. So what's the benefit of it?

Most children will repeat whatever they hear without any understanding or context. Children's shows are made for children, swearing would add nothing for the target demographic. In addition, the backlash from parents who wouldn't want their children exposed to vulgar language would be enormous. Why does little Timmy need to know what a motherfucker is? He certainly doesn't need to learn about it while watching a kid's television show.

Its true that kids will repeat things they hear. But I honestly dont think its a bad thing. Its just swearing. Not murder or rape.

Well I can't argue with that...but why should children be exposed to vocabulary that is a)not appropriate for them to ever use b)beyond their level of understanding? Why should their first exposure be on a children's tv show? It doesn't make much sense to me. This episode of Sesame Street has been brought to you by the letter "F"?

You would be arming them with weapons that they can't use with any amount of tact. It would only open them up to negative consequences from teachers, parents and other adults. How we speak effects the way others view us. I don't have a problem with swearing but I understand the context in which it's ok to swear as an adult.

Hi! I think this is an interesting idea. I certainly agree that there are worse things out there in the world than swearing. However, I think there are more potential dangers that come with characters swearing in children's shows than people realize. I recently took a childhood & adolescence course, where we learned about an infant imitation study conducted by Meltzoff. Essentially, infants have a window into other people's minds through imitation. In a study where a researcher stuck out their tongue, the babies also stuck out their tongues. Although this is a pretty simple example, it demonstrates that babies can copy what you're doing from a super young age before they even know that they have a face. Similarly, babies will also open their mouths and pucker their lips, or clench their hands if you do.

Also, there's evidence that media characters can bridge real life experiences with those that are onscreen. Kids' favorite media characters can actually help teach them valuable skills. Although it might initially sound silly, the parasocial relationships that kids form with tv characters (emotionally tinged relationships that are one sided) actually are associated with increased STEM learning. This is why shows that are somewhat interactive, like Dora the explorer, are very beneficial for kids because the kids engage in imaginative play and learn how to form parasocial relationships, like nurturing and prosocial behavior, which is very important later on in life as well. An example of a parasocial interaction is when Dora will ask the kid watching what their favorite part of the story was, and then the show will pause to let the kid respond, making it seem like Dora is actually listening to their response.

My point is that there's tons of evidence that kids actually imitate and retain things that they hear from a very young age even though it might seem like they're too young to really have a long-term memory or processing capacity. This is why it's really important to avoid showing them tv shows with swearing because not only could they imitate the curse words they hear, but this is introducing them to negative behavior at a young age and could manifest itself later on in their lives. Also, this is an especially important topic today, as the rise of media consumption doesn't seem to be slowing down anytime soon– according to a study done in 2017, 0-8 year olds spend about 2 hours a day using screen media, which can disrupt things like language development. There's also evidence that prior to age 2, children learn better from face to face interactions as opposed to a video presentation. Given that kids today do spend a lot more time watching tv and media compared to in the past, I think it's extremely important to ensure that the media content they are exposed to promotes positive behavior and avoids curse words.

I'd be very interested to hear what you think about all this! Do you have any examples of specific kids shows that include swearing that you view in a positive light?

This is a very well thought out response and what you say is 100% true. I cant argue with that. And perhaps youre right that avoiding swearing in kids show is a good thing.

Wow never knew that Dora the Explorer has it benefits. Always hated that show but I will see it in a different light now.

Well I dont really see swearing as bad. I just saw it as nothing wrong with it. I always thought that having swearing makes shows more realistic. A show (movie to be precise) for kids that has swearing which I find acceptable is Iron Man: Rise of Technovore. I didnt see anything wrong with swearing in superhero shows. (All these opinions were before you CMV.)

Do you see the irony in that sentence? Why wouldn't someone use immature, childish words in a kids show? The whole point is that they are not grown up.

Sorry. I meant mature kid shows like Avatar TLA. Its a show about war. Swearing would not be out of place. I do however think kids show for 1-5 y/o kids should not have swearing.

Its a show about war.

There is a difference between how war is portrayed in the show and how war really is. I don’t think that Avatar is a childish or immature show, but come on, the war theme is significantly watered down.

Why do you think this is? Not agreeing or disagreeing, but I do wonder why the line should be drawn here.

Yeah, perhaps you're right about this. War in the show is way different from how war irl is.

Well to me that age kids are still VERY impressionable. However, above that they can sense the nuance of things. Besides, most kids above 6 curse a lot anyway and end up fine as adults.

Well to me that age kids are still VERY impressionable. However, above that they can sense the nuance of things.

So now it’s just a conversation of when a child can understand the time and place for curse words. And honestly, I don’t think there’s truly a definitive answer for this. I don’t remember when I started using curse words, probably around 9-10, but my friends and I would curse around each other all the time. On the other hand, by that point we knew enough to keep that talk away from parents/teachers/other inappropriate situations that could get us in trouble. Obviously that doesn’t work for everyone and some kids might not care about the consequences enough, but you may be onto something.

Still, just because some kids can handle it doesn’t mean they all possess that nuance at a hard age. Some kids don’t learn when certain language is appropriate until like 12-13, and by that age they’re watching PG-13 movies so that’s probably just the best way to base that right now.

The other comments already addressed my opinion but you are also right about this. Yeah, thinking about it now, vulgar language can be bad at times.

I don’t care much about the bodily function swear words and I use them in front of my kids occasionally. The danger is that they’ll repeat it and people will judge us for it. These are just prudish class words as far as I can tell, old English words instead of classy French words— shit instead of the fancy French defication, fuck instead of fornication.

But I think the real obscenities are the hate ones— bitch, f——t, n word. Those I don’t use and would be angry to have someone teach my kids. I care less if people think we’re low class than that we’re hateful.

I use swearing to emphasize my point. I only use swearing if I have a very strong opinion about something. I think that if children get used to swearing all the time they will start to accept it as normal. I think the only time swearing should be used is if you feel very strongly about something. If you swear just to swear, how are you going to express how strongly you feel in a different situation?

Using swear words as meaningless adjectives or filler words is encouraging improper speech to children that are still learning about such things.
