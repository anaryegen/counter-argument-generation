Liberté versus égalité

The fact that the content of human rights has been broadly defined should not be taken to imply that the three generations of rights are equally accepted by everyone. Nor should broad acceptance of the idea of human rights suggest that their generations or their separate elements have been greeted with equal urgency. The ongoing debate about the nature and content of human rights reflects, after all, a struggle for power and for favoured conceptions of the “good society.”

Aug. 23, 2024, 3:18 AM ET (The Point) GBA concludes training on human rights

First-generation proponents, for example, are inclined to exclude second- and third-generation rights from their definition of human rights altogether or, at best, to regard them as “derivative.” In part this is because of the complexities involved in putting these rights into operation. The suggestion that first-generation rights are more feasible than other generations because they stress the absence over the presence of government is somehow transformed into a prerequisite of a comprehensive definition of human rights, such that aspirational claims to entitlement are deemed not to be rights at all. The most-compelling explanation for such exclusions, however, has more to do with ideology or politics than with operational concerns. Persuaded that egalitarian claims against the rich, particularly where collectively espoused, are unworkable without a severe decline in liberty, first-generation proponents, inspired by the natural law and laissez-faire traditions, are committed to the view that human rights are inherently independent of organized society and are necessarily individualistic.

Conversely, second- and third-generation defenders often look upon first-generation rights, at least as commonly practiced, as insufficiently attentive to material—especially “basic”—human needs and, indeed, as being instruments in service to unjust social orders, hence constituting a “bourgeois illusion.” Accordingly, if they do not place first-generation rights outside their definition of human rights, these partisans tend to assign such rights a low status and to treat them as long-term goals that will come to pass only after the imperatives of economic and social development have been met, to be realized gradually and fully achieved only sometime vaguely in the future.

This liberty-equality and individualist-collectivist debate was especially evident during the period of the Cold War, reflecting the extreme tensions that then existed between liberal and Hegelian-Marxist conceptions of sovereign public order. Although Western social democrats during this period, particularly in Scandinavia, occupied a position midway between the two sides, pursuing both liberty and equality—in many respects successfully—it remains true that the different conceptions of rights contain the potential for challenging the legitimacy and supremacy not only of one another but, more importantly, of the sociopolitical systems with which they are most intimately associated.

The relevance of custom and tradition: the universalist-relativist debate

With the end of the Cold War, however, the debate took on a more North-South character and was supplemented and intensified by a cultural-relativist critique that eschewed the universality of human rights doctrines, principles, and rules on the grounds that they are Western in origin and therefore of limited relevance in non-Western settings. The viewpoint underlying this assertion—that the scope of human rights in any given society should be determined fundamentally by local, national, or regional customs and traditions—may seem problematic, especially when one considers that the idea of human rights and many of its precepts are found in all the great philosophical and religious traditions. Nevertheless, the historical development of human rights demonstrates that the relativist critique cannot be wholly or axiomatically dismissed. Nor is it surprising that it should emerge soon after the end of the Cold War. First prominently expressed in the declaration that emerged from the Bangkok meeting held in preparation to the second UN World Conference on Human Rights convened in Vienna in June 1993 (which qualified a reaffirmation of the universality of human rights by stating that human rights “must be considered in the context of…national and regional particularities and various historical, cultural and religious backgrounds”), the relativist critique reflects the end of a bipolar system of alliances that had discouraged independent foreign policies and minimized cultural and political differences in favour of undivided Cold War loyalties.

Against the backdrop of increasing human rights interventionism on the part of the UN and by regional organizations and deputized coalitions of states (as in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Somalia, Liberia, Rwanda, Haiti, Serbia and Kosovo, Libya, and Mali, for example), the relativist viewpoint serves also as a functional equivalent of the doctrine of respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity, which had been declining in influence not only in the human rights context but also in the contexts of national security, economics, and the environment. As a consequence, there remains sharp political and theoretical disagreement about the legitimate scope of human rights and about the priorities that are claimed among them.

Inherent risks in the debate

On final analysis, however, this legitimacy-priority debate can be dangerously misleading. Although useful for pointing out how notions of liberty and individualism have been used to rationalize the abuses of capitalism and Western expansionism and for exposing the ways in which notions of equality, collectivism, and culture have been alibis for authoritarian governance, in the end the debate risks obscuring at least three essential truths that must be taken into account if the contemporary worldwide human rights movement is to be understood objectively.

First, one-sided characterizations of legitimacy and priority are very likely, at least over the long term, to undermine the political credibility of their proponents and the defensibility of the rights they regard as preeminently important. In an increasingly interdependent global community, any human rights orientation that does not support the widest possible shaping and sharing of values or capabilities among all human beings is likely to provoke widespread skepticism. The period since the mid-20th century is replete with examples, among them the official U.S. position that only civil and political rights—including the rights to own property and to invest in processes of production and exchange—can be deemed legally recognizable rights.

Second, such characterizations do not accurately reflect reality. In the real world, virtually all societies, whether individualistic or collectivist in essential character, at least consent to, and most even promote, a mixture of all basic values or capabilities. U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s Four Freedoms (freedom of speech and expression, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and freedom from fear) is an early case in point. A later demonstration is found in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action of the 1993 conference mentioned above, adopted by representatives of 171 states. It proclaims that

[w]hile the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical, cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind, it is the duty of States, regardless of their political, economic and cultural systems, to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms.

Finally, in the early 21st century, none of the international human rights instruments in force or proposed said anything about the legitimacy or priority of the rights it addresses, save possibly in the case of rights that by international covenant are stipulated to be “nonderogable” and therefore, arguably, more fundamental than others (e.g., freedom from arbitrary or unlawful deprivation of life, freedom from torture and from inhuman or degrading treatment and punishment, freedom from slavery, and freedom from imprisonment for debt). To be sure, some disagreements about legitimacy and priority can derive from differences of definition (e.g., what is “torture” or “inhuman treatment” to one may not be so to another, as in the case of punishment by caning or waterboarding or by death). Similarly, disagreements can arise also when treating the problem of implementation. For instance, some insist first on certain civil and political guarantees, whereas others defer initially to conditions of material well-being. Such disagreements, however, reflect differences in political agendas and have little if any conceptual utility. As confirmed by numerous resolutions of the UN General Assembly and reaffirmed in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, there is a wide consensus that all human rights form an indivisible whole and that the protection of human rights is not and should not be a matter of purely national jurisdiction. The extent to which the international community actually protects the human rights it prescribes is, on the other hand, a different matter.
