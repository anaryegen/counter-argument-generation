Why don't we have stricter penalties for rape?

Increasing prison time will bring down the number of rapes, as men will be more afraid of committing rapes and going to jail for a long time. I think some countries also have death penalty for rape? Some Islamic countries cut off arms or something - but they also oppress women so we should not follow them.

Also, I am curious about difference between rape culture and like murder culture? . Obviously like making punishment severe will bring number of rapes down, but can we completely eradicate it? [Like even in advanced countries people still commit murder even if jail time is very high]. Share

Obviously like making punishment severe will bring number of rapes down

Does it? I'm not sure that's a given. Further, no level of punishment by itself will stop it entirely, especially whilst you're trying to deliver such punishments using flawed justice systems as a vehicle. I'd argue that throwing harsher punishments at the problem does nothing to address the root causes of rape.

but they also oppress women so we should not follow them.

This statement is utterly lacking in perspective. You don't do as a country does because it's a good country that does the good things, you look at the things they do and decide whether or not they're good.

Statistics show that the likelihood of being convicted far outweighs the severity of the punishment.

Studies have showed that harsher punishments do not deter crimes. One reason for this is that people don’t generally weigh the pros and cons before committing crimes, they tend to be a heat of the moment thing.

or they genuinely don't think they'll be caught or held accountable

Studies have shown that if you say 'Studies have shown' at the start of a sentence more people are likely to believe your point (You actually did make a good point this is a joke)

One level of punishment can stop it : chemical (or otherwise irreversible) castration. I would accept 10 years for rape with irreversible castration.

You don't only rape with a penis.

It's not a pretty process; very much falls under the banner of "cruel and unusual" punishment, you're essentially fucking with someone's whole biological rhythm.

So, we should cut their arms off?

Surely you can't be serious.

Upstairs-Cobbler2697

Her statement is problematic, it seems as if she is implying this. Even the death penalty might make sense in some extreme cases, but cutting arms off is kind of sick.

No it's not. You drew a ridiculous conclusion from a reasonable statement, which was that "actions should be examined on their own merits, not whether they are done by good people." That in no way implies that we should be out here cutting people's arms off.

She was absolutely not implying anything of the sort.

Severity of punishment is not a deterrent to crime. The certainty of punishment is. And punishment for rape is very uncertain.

Upstairs-Cobbler2697

Is this because of evidence issues - like there are issues with collecting DNA of rapist? I mean obviously if you kill someone, it is very difficult to hide that.

No, DNA evidence is easier to collect in a rape case than any other crime. The problem is that it is difficult to distinguish between rape and consensual sex. Remember, most rapes are committed by someone known to the victim. Sometimes there just isn’t enough evidence to prove a rape occurred. That can’t be helped. That’s just the nature of the crime.

But we also often have problems with law enforcement not taking rape cases seriously. They may assume the victim is lying without investigation or bully the victim into dropping the case because they don’t want to deal with it. Judges reduce sentences of convicted rapists because they don’t want to ruin their lives over a “mistake”.

Attorneys bring up irrelevant details of the victim’s sexual history as “evidence” that she consented. I remember a case a few years back of a gang rape of an unconscious women filmed by the assailants. Their attorney tried to claim that her shaved pubic hair was evidence that she was an aspiring porn actress and this video was an audition tape. I kid you not. Fortunately, this ploy did not work.

There was another case where a woman was raped by a police officer on the hood of his patrol car. And the defense attorney found a picture she took as a teen where she was sitting on a car hood. He claimed it was evidence that sex on a car hood was a longtime fantasy of hers. The jury accepted this one and the suspect was found not guilty.

I dont want to live in this world anymore -.-

Indeed. I recall a case in Ireland in 2018 where a 27-year-old man was acquitted of raping a 17-year-old girl, partially because the defense lawyer presented the victim's underwear and said that "you have to look at the way she was dressed" and argued that if the victim was not attracted to the defendant, if she was not open to meeting someone and "being with someone," she would not have worn a black lace-front thong.

To add to this, getting care and a rape kit done in the US is not free. It is expensive just like every other US hospital visit.

There is this girl in Spain who was gang-raped by 5 dudes . They recorded it and share it on a whatsapp groupchat with many more men.

This was judged the first time by a panel of 3 judges. While finding them guilty, one of them issued a dissenting opinion saying that by looking at the videos we cannot be entirely sure she was not enjoying it and that he got a "festive vibe" from her (she basically just does what they tell her to do, she explained during the trial that she, understandably, just wanted it to be done and to be as safe as possible).

Also she was shamed by the defense and the dissenting judge for carrying on with her life. This was prescribed by her psyquiatrist for her sanity and to protect her identiy. They shamed her for meeting friends and posting on IG.

Bty the final sentence, after going to a higher court, is 15 years, the maximum you can get for rape after the outrageous 8-year sentence they got before that.

My point is, you can gave video evidence and still there will be people who won't believe you

Yeah. It was a revolting case. Its been years and I am still disgusted by my country for that :(

I cant believe that the degenerate judge that stated that he saw a "festive vibe" was not punished for that. Its repulsive :(

That judge is most likely either an apologist or rapist. And another prime example of reasons why survivors don’t report.

The harshness of a penalty means nothing without certainty. There’s no point in making it stricter as long as the majority of rapists get away with their crimes and the victims get blamed and mistreated by the justice system.

Greater penalties for rape make it far more likely for the victim to be murdered. Why leave a witness if your going to get a life sentence etc.

This is actually a great point.

So slap rapists on the wrist so they don’t kill their victims?! I’m curious about your sources on this one.

Its what an Australian police prosecuter told me when i asked why the sentancing in my country was so appallingly lenient for sex crimes. I am not saying I agree with it, but it does make perfect sense. In their view, it's far more important the victim survive a rape.

I think there's quite a difference between "a life sentence" and "a slap on the wrist," don't you?

Harsher punishment doesn't decrease the incidence of crime, but there's an argument to be made that more frequent prosecution does reduce the incidence of some crimes.

For example: broken windows policing or three strike laws didn't decrease minor property crimes or drug possession, especially when people do those crimes to survive. However, more frequent enforcement of parking violations or driving offenses does cause people to be more careful.

When it comes to sexual assault, the problem isn't that we don't punish rapists harshly enough but that we don't go after enough rapists. People already know they could catch years for raping someone but they figure that the chance of actually getting caught is too low to worry about

I don't think "stricter penalties" would be much of a deterrent since most rapists never even go to court.

Can I ask you what you think "rape culture" is?

what do you mean by this?

Upstairs-Cobbler2697

By advanced countries I mean countries with high development. I mean to say that even though opportunities might be more than poor countries, we still cannot stop crime. So I thought that with with stricter penalties rapes will go down, but I do not understand how we can completely eradicate them.

I have heard feminists say that rape culture exists and we have statements like teach men not to rape - implying that we are teaching men to rape. But I don't understand how crime is influenced by culture. Because you would think that in an advanced countries crime rates will be lower, but that does not happen so it is confusing how there is a culture of crime.

Rape culture refers to the acceptance of rape myths in a culture that downplay rape. These myths include things like if they were dressed like that then they were asking for it, men cannot be raped because they always want sex, she went to his apartment that means she wanted sex and just regretted it afterwards, “promiscuous” women cannot be raped, rape cannot occur in an established relationship because consent once means consent always. Etc. These attitudes exist even in “advanced” countries.

Upstairs-Cobbler2697

I understand this. But my question is, if we teach people to not have such problematic attitudes, will the number of rapes be 0? It's confusing because some advanced countries actually have higher rates of crime than some less developed countries.

You seem to keep focusing on 0 or bust as a goal. Don't let perfect be the enemy of progress. It's possible to reduce a bad thing, but not all the way to zero, and have that still be a huge and worthwhile change.

While "advanced countries" is a problematic phrase, I think you'll find that countries with more progressive attitudes towards rape have higher rates of reporting on crimes. It is not necessarily safe to conclude crime rates are actually higher.

I don't think the rate of any human behavior that provides pleasure (however disgusting) to the perpetrator will ever be totally non-existent.

I don't really understand the question you're asking, but try doing a search engine search for: "efficacy + prison confinement + deterrent" and see what you find. Turns out longer prison terms aren't as effective at deterring criminals as we thought in the 90's.

It’s not likely that rape will ever be non existent, we simply don’t want it to be as insanely prevalent as it is now.

It will never be zero. And remember, crime statistics are difficult to track. A lot of crimes go unreported especially rape and underdeveloped countries in particular. Some countries have increased rape statistics because reporting has increased not the actual crime rate.

You need to understand that countries with a more fair and less sexist court system will have more reports of abuse and rape just because it is safer for women to report it.

You wouldnt see any reports in pre democracy spain (my country) about husbands raping their wifes because it was perfectly legal for them to rape and beat their wifes. You see them now because now it is a crime to do so. But still a lot of women don't report because they are bullied by the police and ignored. So it makes sense that the fairer the justice system becomes the more women reports.

A brief explanation of what feminists mean when they talk about "rape culture:"

Rape culture is, in short, a collection of behaviors and attitudes ingrained in society, socialized from birth and often wielded unconsciously, which enable and encourage the subordination of women by maintaining an environment that is pervasively hostile and threatening to them. These behaviors/attitudes include (but are not limited to): certain aspects of “chivalry,” male sexual aggression and female sexual passivity, victim-blaming, street harassment, intimidation, leering, sexual harassment, cis and heteronormativity, domestic violence, sexual assault, and rape. In a rape culture, women are the submissive receptors of sex and men are the dominant, controlling actors. It also leaves male victims completely out of any conversations about rape, sexual assault, etc. It is part of the patriarchal society we live in.

As it is right now, they're barely even giving convicted rapists prison time. Theyll ne sentenced to a year an be out in 2 months for good behaviour. Or they'll just get a community sentance and never even have to step foot in prison.

One of the main reasons is that the prisons are full. They are overpopulated, with prisoners sharing rooms with 3 other people when they're meant for 2.

Prisons are being underfunded, meaning all rehabilitation type programmes are being closed. The food is awful. Living conditions poor.

So, when they get one prisoner in, there is a rush to get someone out. This is usually the people who commit petty crime and...rape.

So why are rapists the ones who get to go early? Do they see it as not as bad of a crime because they don't value women as victims? Do they believe that they were all falsely accused? Do they blame the victims because they must have been asking for it?

There are many factors to consider when it comes to why certain prisoners are released. And perhaps one of those factors is ingrained misogyny.

As things are right now, it's unlikely raising the sentance time will have any major affect because they can't be housed, and will probably still just get out early anyway.

Upstairs-Cobbler2697

I don't think they do not value women as victims. But do you not think that there are worse crimes than rape? Keeping murderers, arsonists, drug dealers, etc in might have priority over rapists. Don't get me wrong, I am the one who is actually hoping for harsher consequences for rapists, but I am also aware that murderers, arsonists, drug dealers, are a bigger threat to society as a whole - because they can commit crimes against people regardless of their gender, age or anything and they could have large number of victims in a short period of time. Changing problematic attitudes takes time, but the solution to that is not release an arsonist or a murderer in place of a rapist - they can kill hundreds in a fire, we have already had so many mass shootings. Like I understand some of your points, but there are difference of levels in severity between rape and other major crimes.

So...the violation of a piece of property (arsonists) is "priority" over violence against women... ??

You are thinking small scale. Arson on a large scale like an apartment building not only could kill very many people, but leave them homeless etc.

So yes just setting fire to something illegally may seem less important than bodily harm.. But it can also be very much as damaging and more than bodily harm.

burned apartment buildings can easily be rebuild.

More replies More replies

Like I said, there are many factors to consider so your points aren't wrong at all.

But there is a system that sees crimes against women taken less serious.

For example...why let a rapist free when you could release the thousands in prison for minor drug use like cannabis?

Rapists also commit crimes against people of all ages and genders...

I think some women are valued as victims: young, attractive, middle-class, white women who are raped by scary strangers in a dark alley. But a lot of rape victims are POC, or trans, or sex workers, or illegal immigrants, or other marginalized groups. Others are raped by their romantic partners or dates, or after a night of heavy drinking, which "doesn't count" in a lot of people's eyes. Others are raped by men who don't fit the typical image of a rapist - men who might be respected and beloved within their community.

Only around half of prison inmates with sentence over 1 year are doing time for major violent offenses... the rest are mostly there for drug or property crimes, or for nonviolent recidivism after being released from prison for a prior offense. Long sentences have resulted in an aging prison population, even though older people are statistically unlikely to commit violent crimes. So there's definitely room in the prisons for shorter but more consistently applied sentences.

I believe you’re making some very broad statements and making some very broad assumptions.

I can show you multiple cases where men were given over 20 years for rape. Should they deserve more or less I don’t know. It depends on the situation and the nature of the “rape.” There are even legal categories for severity of different rape cases.

You have to go before the board before you’re allowed to exit. The original intent for prison was rehabilitation, not just overt punishment. Your thought process here, that rapist are somehow green lit over other potential candidate getting released means you don’t fully understand the system.

Rape culture is a lie in the west. We scorn, and put people in prison who commit rape. Are some men, including judges assholes, yes. Does our “culture” have a rape problem. I would say no. But, this phrase can mean whatever the person saying it means.

I can show you multiple cases where men were given over 20 years for rape

Wow how amazing, out of a population of millions, you can show us multiple cases, I can literally show multiple cases of people dying because of noodles but unless you want to try, I haven't heard of any noodle killing epidemic.

It means whatever people want it to mean to meet their victim narrative.

People in the West have no idea what rape culture is. As In, rape is okay, and accepted by society. Welcome to the modern world, it’s a solid place 🙂

That is... not what rape culture means. At all.

One of the largest problems according to rainn.org is only 3% of rapists even see jail time.

So I think the question we need to be asking is why aren’t we doing more to even get them into jail

This is under the presumption that all rapists are charged in the first place with rape, but only about 25% of rapes are actually reported, of those reported, only sixteen percent end up leading to arrests (16% of reported not the total), and of THOSE only 1% of rapes lead to a conviction.

https://www.rainn.org/statistics/criminal-justice-system

If you actually think about that statistic, the chances of getting punished for rape is so low that getting arrested for is like winning a 10K lottery and that's a conservative estimate.

In other words, we shouldn't be starting at the incarceration level when it comes to properly addressing rape culture, we have to start at the police and cultural level. This is one of the other benefits to defunding the police too, putting money into social programs that can actually protect victims of rape.

But it also happens with people like us right now, no number of laws can fix this unless we call this shit out. Whether that'd be trying to normalize conversation around rape, un-normalizing rape culture, being sensitive to the topic, etc. Because rape is already illegal, but the law doesn't uphold us, we uphold the law, it's up to us and not the prison system.

Severe punishments have never stopped crime. Rape is and all other crimes are social issues. There are various problems within the society that cause people to commit such crimes. Until we fix those social issues rape will continue.

I mean the same countries who happen to cut off arms, also send the women to prison for adultery if the perpetrator claims it was consensual.

we already can't get em in jail, better focus on that...

So many men rape women without even acknowledging that what they did is rape that harsher punishments won’t be a deterrent.

I don’t believe it’s necessarily punishment that prevents rape. Yes it can deter people from committing crimes and is a statement of what is and is not acceptable. But I think what’s more impactful is how raped and sex crimes are handled by police and the criminal justice system in general. The number of rapists that aren’t convicted, the rape kits that are never tested, and the cops who end up disbelieving or blaming women for being raped are a bigger problem in my opinion. There are laws to convict rapists and sentence them to jail but often they never get arrested, the rape isn’t reported, or the allegation isn’t taken seriously. If victims of sexual abuse were treated with respect, felt supported and protected, and trusted the criminal justice system, I believe this would go a long way to get rapists off the streets. Laws can change but it doesn’t mean anything if the entire system is broken.

Let's not advocate for violence, okay?

I havent landed on a firm opinion regarding a punishment type of justice system. Justice involves more than just the perpetrator, we rarely talk about justice for the victim. As far as what to do with those that have committed violent crimes and not wanting them to continue doing so, the answer seems overwhelmingly to be rehabilitation. The application of this idea is no where near where it should be. Someone that has learned to abusive habits, is not going to find value in others lives by being tortured for the duration of their sentence, in fact, it can make it far worse.

Professor Daniel C Dennett, one of the worlds top philosophers, makes an argument that we should not abolish punishment because it works as a deincentive to committing violent crimes. I would be interested to see analysis of this.

Maybe not a counter argument but an adjacent argument would be, perhaps we should invest in improving culture so we dont produce individuals that perpatrare violent crimes. I believe this would be a provably better system of justice.

If a culture can make something worse, I dont see why we cant make something better. For instance, racist culture. If the media is constantly pumping out implicit and explicit racist content that normalizes those ideas while on another front attack their system of education in a way that prevents individuals from learning important skills such as critical thinking then you might see a rise in, say, white supremacist ideology (or even nazis... Dont get me started on nazis. May they experience the full force of God's wrath). If you reversed that trend to where an investment is made in improving their education system and in socially concious media to compete against the hateful media then you would like reverse that trend.

Sex crimes might be much more challenging task. Even the "best" education system in the world could still be sexist in any number of ways so just investing in education isnt enough. It needs to be reformed. Honestly maybe even revolutionized. We require students to spend nearly half of their undergraduate degree on subjects that are not in their major but which schools require that they take courses on feminism or other courses to do with equality? For how large of an issue sex crimes are, how much time do we spend in our high school education system teaching students how to not be shitbag humans? The answer is basically none.

It's just not taken seriously. In the eyes of the law we can fully agree women are barely seen as human. Adding on the fact most rapists arnt caught, which means that there isn't a deterrent for new offenders.

Yes, because we don’t advocate violence here.

It needs to be a big taboo to sexualize women. Men should feel ashamed of “checking women out”. They should feel that men who can’t control themselves are contemptible people.

I think that will reduce a lot of sexual violence.

Yeah I don't think so. Men who can't control themselves, yes, sure, but "feel ashamed of checking women out?"

Men finding women attractive is not the problem here.

It’s not a question of finding a woman attractive or not. It’s a question of objectifying a woman, of lusting after her. That should be a taboo among men. It diminishes a man’s dignity to do that. He should feel that.

Not sure why I’m getting the downvotes.

Because the things you are saying are nonsense.

I don’t understand how teaching men not to objectify women wouldn’t reduce the amount of sexual harassment and assault.

Please explain it to me like I’m 5.

I feel this question is great and all for discussion, but I feel the punishments you are giving as an example is quite poor in its effectivity as well as reception. A better punishment should be strict rehabilitation with strong methods, prison won't teach criminals to stop crimes, most criminals have had prison prior. In addition, there should also be a stronger and more methodised condition to convict rapists. Also in Morden femininity terms, both cultures are the same, where all men rape and murder women on the street and their wives for pleasure, which is idiotic. Also, I oppose most extreme feminist and am stating my opinion in this matter.
