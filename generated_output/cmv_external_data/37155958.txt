The Commodification of the Self, Neoliberalism & Psychological Impacts of Selfie Culture

Interested in data and humans.

Published Oct 15, 2021

The self, humans are constant watchers of one another. The watcher, being watched. The 24-hour-surveillance of following one another digitally, accompany each other’s lives in isolation but posting to redeem life satisfaction. The implications in the selfie culture pertaining to the commodification of the self and its psychological impacts discourses increasing contemporary issues such as concepts of fake scenarios, posting to redeem life satisfaction, and how this can be problematic in well-being. Furthermore, analyzing trends- fitness, nutrition, magazines, photos of how the role of new media is significant in self-representation displaying unhealthy images pushing toward social comparison and mental health issues. The themes concluded from a variety of eight scholarly sources outlines two significant themes that will draw for analysis a) motivations behind social media representation b) social media and neoliberalism.

Monetizing My Image: Motivations Behind Social Media Representation

To understand the commodification of the self, one must look back at the early 2000s and of course, Paris Hilton, the ultimate icon who after all created the concept and notion of being followed. Paparazzi’s everywhere - miniskirts, poodles and the transition from 00s pop culture, and rapid technological changes. In 2005, Smartphones launched, and Steve Jobs iPhone in 2007 marked the beginning of an era of information, design, and most importantly of surveillance capitalism. The media expanded new avenues of fame, with 24 hours entertainment culture, psychological destructure contributed to 40 percent of 10–12-year-old-children reporting a desire to be famous as their number one goal in life (Maltby, et al. 2008). Thus, forever changing the course of how data is created, and fed into machine learning systems, classified by computers to further curate for our eyes only. And the curation entailed enhanced face features, larger eyes, structured cheekbones, lighter skin tone, and no texture skin. In fact, per Carla Rodrigues et al. methylphenidate often known as Ritalin is amongst university students' highest purchase and consumption. This indicates the social performance investment on trends and body/ skin texture experiments often viewed on 15 second Tik Tok videos. And how little our attention span is in the 21st century and how small impact videos that self-manage to perform affect users' focus on enhancement technologies. In Coded Bias, Joy Buolamwini explains how the lack of diverse data contributes to a wealth gap (2019, Coded Bias).

The “idea” of beauty in the 21st century also comes with the commodification of the self via selfie filters that are advertised and sponsored to influencers on Snap, Face Tune, and Instagram filters. Thus, the population and its users have the tendency to follow, click-bait the page, and if luckily after the whole process of consumer behavior, the final act - the manipulative credit card swipe. The finishing purchase, or delivery of a product/ service (enhancing /editing/shopping/beauty apps) by a company, or invitation e.g., Paris Fashion Week (Channel / Fendi / Hermes / Off-White / LV shows the intensification of branded materials worth thousands, if not millions of dollars to later be posted on social media for the next month. Therefore, reinforcing this dopamine-led cycle, fueled by consumer goods, lavish parties, influencer status, latest trends, and the ability to keep engaging and feeding social mediums content. Thus, one’s personal or fabricated life is shared by a system of planning to catalog, and posting at certain times of the day, ensuring lookalike tactics, demographic data to have conversion rates on influencing likes, attention, and gratification from 24 hours live shows on Paris Fashion Week. Erving Goffman's front and backstage theory can very much apply to this notion of a recreational life whether that is health and beauty leisure or perception stimulants. The concept for exercise or concentration performance shows how these are indeed social roles and personal aspirations that one has; hence, a backstage performance how one is intrinsically feeling, more sincere. In contrast, the front stage performance will tend to have individuals perform social roles based on popularity, trends, for [sexual] confidence (Carla Rodrigues et al.). In all, catering a public identity to the wants and needs of the target audience.

The fact is, programmers are unknown of the errors contained in a black box (Zuboff, 2019). Hence, when accessing social media, the psychological impacts of selfie culture exclude what algorithms are unconsciously doing – that is creating a system to be approved upon recognition of likes, shares, comments, engagement because the more you reflect your features online that includes attributions of age, demographics, language, education, race, personality (introvert/extrovert), the more you post, the “more” you are awarded in selfie-culture. The awards are components that glorify the act of commodification. One can argue that recompenses in the influencer culture are imaginary concepts of fitness trends-based products (powder, gummies, waste-band, yoga mat, face roller), hotels, airplanes portraying a lifestyle of luxury (mimosas, branded items, and cars), food (Dior, Gucci cafés and the interdisciplinary of gourmet culinary and fashion) catering the wants and need of users. To restaurants, puppies, and garments - when in fact, is an illusion and front stage performance given by sponsors. It is not a mere reality but rather an obsession that suggests six factors of implicit theories of a desire for fame:

2. meaning derived through social comparisons,

3. psychologically vulnerable,

4. attention-seeking,

5. conceitedness and

(Maltby, et al. 2008)

Ultimately the commodification of the self is infused by 24-hour-television, entertainment, and celebrity influence; however, nowadays depicted via social mediums – Facebook, Reddit, Instagram, Snap Chat, Twitter, and more (Maltby, et al. 2008). The internet age is limitless, and interfaces are always connecting, creating new mediums or websites every day worldwide. When all of our information is shared for the purpose of gratification, reward, being noticed, and monetization is so powerful that a single post can be worth 1 million dollars. In 2018, Kylie Jenner was paid 1 million dollars for a sponsored post on Instagram- making her the highest-paid celebrity. The extreme of commodification pushes society to a scale that is in constant social comparison, impossible to differentiate real from fake appearances. Social media is so prevalent that there are no limits to how much one can commodify themselves or be profit-oriented via videos on YouTube, posts on Instagram, limited thoughts on Twitter, and ability to freelance on Fivver to the extreme of making a six-figure salary proving how interdisciplinary and active our society really is. The freedom technology gives an individual looking to commodify based on self-performance food supplements or now OnlyFans Page shows what lengths humans are willing to explore in the interfaces that the internet provides for users to commodify one’s self (Roigues et at., 2019).

The Commodification of the Self and its Psychological Impacts

Humans are willing to go measurements to reach milestones, especially if they are publicly recognized. Hence, a vast range of products come into play when dealing with appearances. The performance of these products is a desire to construct a social imagination of improvement. However, what one does not realize are the implications for managing every life when under the influence of substances including rigid food, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, energy drinks, and so forth, - that reconfigures one’s consumption practices by infusing with psychological impacts. The perceived legitimacy of these products involves tiredness to sexual and aesthetic management; thus, the body becomes the locus of investment to perform. An individual’s intrinsic motivation intaking consumption suggests most situations are the results of self-initiative or friends and family’s advice (Carla Rodrigues et. Al., 2019, p. 1010). The quantitative data analyses interviews and transcripts show how energy drinks are viewed for “improving the image/aesthetics,” and “improved good mood.” Furthermore, to be successful in commodifying performance, one cannot (afford to) manage tiredness. The psychological implications go beyond the correlation of substance abuse of energy drinks, to fighting tiredness or intaking supplements. The theoretical debate of influencers and the people consuming products e.g. all results on one’s incentive to restore their “normal” self. Thus, implicating that selfie culture is lost, and individuals are in this contemporary belief of “wishing” to succeed by “appearing successful,” by having glowy skin, filled lips, sculpted waist, and reconfiguration of self- for society’s standard. This notion of success does therefore question beauty standards in correlation to one’s success and wealth.

Fashion also becomes integral to the self-commodification and psychological impacts of comparison and jealousy when fluctuated with an abundant amount of digital content on a user’s newsfeed. Therefore, the artist becomes the brand, however in the fashion industry where the act of commodification of the self is common, the border between “ethical sell” and the “mass-produced sell,” can be viewed as a form of collision. Hence, due to the fact, a limited, small number of groups have access and can afford ethical fashion or indulge in green eco-sustainable, conscious thinking. One can conclude that the commodification of the self and mental implications excludes groups, creates tribes of veganism, YouTube makeup gurus, or travel addicts whose particular materials are involved in having access to limited high-end ethical fashion, fine dining, and traveling. This exclusion and gap between influencers on what is fashionable versus what is marketable serve as social actors in developing taste, or access. Thus, catering to a certain socio-economic class and remaining an elitist pastime that involves the act of marginalizing individuals (Másdóttir, V. (2017).

Social Media and Neoliberalism

The socially recognized hierarchy of the arts corresponds to the social hierarchy of the consumers (Bourdieu 1984, 2). Therefore, platforms such as Instagram serve as a reference for validation and representation for artists however not in any value in itself. This is due to the blurry distinguishment that influencers, artists, and designers become the persona in full as a source to gain notoriety. Therefore, the act of self-commodification revolves around purely showcasing themselves for economic purposes rather than passive engagement. This action can be detrimental to one’s public figure when the re-configuration of oneself comes with negative impacts when “living up to connotations” results in the artist becoming the entrepreneur (Másdóttir, V. (2017). This includes having attributions of market savvy and highly professional demonstrations that make this self-promotion tactic a commodity; thus, allowing meaning to be gained via manufactured assembly lines to ensure “production, marketing, display, and sale” (Másdóttir, V. (2017).

Consequently, leading one to have the desire to become famous, suggesting unstable high self-esteem is gained from external validation. This can often be seen when a video is going viral via a meme, or trend. The objective to document everything “Tell and Witness” indicates why it’s possible to resemblance patterns of the first-ever recorded selfie, to documenting everything digitally; through patterns of limited thinking by means of spying on one another, but as well as possibilities of new creativity when marketing oneself on platforms such as Vine, YouTube, Tik Tok, Facebook, or Instagram stories. This allure often comes from features of fame, celebrities, media coverage, advertisement, and how outlets have made “viral” a possible concept for brief celebrity status and fame moments. Furthermore, 181 female undergraduate subjects of a study found that narcissism is commonly a behavior that is exhibited by individuals whose high levels of self-esteem are linked to status, personality features, and greater recognition. The study found that after seven consecutive days of measuring the state of self-esteem that individuals with unstable high self-esteem have a higher desire for fame. Hence, the unstable self-esteem reflects the underlying negative attributes disguised in an appearance of success, power, or grandiosity for the public’s eye. The fear of not “doing” enough, or simply not being “good” enough suggests individuals' main concern on becoming famous is to feel validated. Thus, concluding that the correlation of self-esteem plays a vital role in providing external validation (Noser & Zeigler, 2014). In all, social media serves as an attractive form for individuals to validate aspects of fame, enhance positive affirmations and self-views. In contrast, fame serves as a means to improve one’s negative feelings of worth. Maltby’s study in 2010, found that high levels of self-esteem are associated with certain aspects of the desire for a lavish, celebrity, lifestyle. The low levels of self-esteem however were associated with the desire to be recognized and famous to compensate for the perceived vulnerabilities. In other words, an opportunity to be accepted by others (Maltby, et al. 2008).

In all, the commodification of the self can also be associated with digital labor by means of objectification in this modern capitalist mode of production. Hence, the neoliberalism on social media’s influence on the economy is organizational, measurable, classifiable, and therefore manipulable (Shields et al., 2010). The factor of production is freely traded as human labor which conveys key neoclassical precepts but questions the capital-labor of a full commodification. The fact is employers want human labor fully objectified in both psychological and physical labor. Thus, concluding that the underlying capitalist labor of the market commodification is rather a labor objectification. Although, objectification is not fully attainable because thinking, embodiment, and emotional labor are still necessary. Therefore, labor is a commodity that feels and reacts; and those categorized as employees are social subjects of a point in production where what lies behind the human labor is the resource of instrumentalization of employees/influencers/users / “head, and hear, skill and effort” (Shields et al., 2010). Lastly, the human understanding of the world is discursive or textual concluding that the essence of the product of the linguistic and non-linguistic practices, in turn, something into an object.

In the capitalist mode of production, the act of commodification and objectification are social parallel processes defining the neoliberalism market mode option of immediate human transformation to value-conferring objects. Therefore, commodification gives one the “exchange” of “object” which is labor power or marketization of the human as the element of production. Furthermore, the analysis of over eight scholarly articles and studies has found that over 200 young females attempt commodification because of low self-esteem in order to make up for validation. In addition, the stories and photos we visually identify, share and portray are an act of revealing personal information that in fact becomes embedded into the user persona performance. Thus, placing one in a position of risk, vulnerability, and anticipation of user’s actions to post, engage, react via status, updates, and online activity for a strategic audience reach. The uninvolving facts of this continuous front-stage act are that some individuals do not actually enjoy this dyadic situation in order to feel validated, and thus feel trapped. Not to mention the psychological implications that neoliberalism influences. The trends are merely impossible to consist of, and FOMO is real. The Fear of Missing Out has adults’ influencers acting like millennials and going miles to feel validated through “mini fame” or viral concepts complicates one’s self-presentation. This discrepancy between the “front” and “back” stage or “influencer” and “real life” is indistinct because not only is there a sense of loneliness and lower life satisfaction but there is confusion between the acts. The psychological effects of “talking a certain way for social media” and comparing it to one’s tendency to talk shows how commodification is an extension of the artist becoming the brand. And thus, implications can be detrimental to one’s psychology from extreme fitness trends, to limited edition bags, serving as an access gate to filter what serves as an exclusion culture. Therefore, the commodification of the self, neoliberalism and psychological impacts suggests that it is indeed toxic on the basis of social comparison in all categories – textual (how one articulates themselves online via artifacts), socially (events, FOMO, exclusivity) and physical (using latest trends, drops, fashion shows, “limited edition”).

The commodification of the self is a personal re-branding that is perpetuated by six contributing factors that include ambition, meaning derived through social comparisons, psychological vulnerability, attention-seeking, conceitedness, and social access. It explores the psychological results of composing fabricated scenarios, viral, trends, and performance when under a highly curated lifestyle hat is shadowed by significant reality tv show celebrity, and magazine influence. The neoliberalism capability of influencer culture and commodification is valued at 8 billion dollars and expected to reach 15 billion by 2022 with advertisements companies increasing their budget towards influencer marketing.

In all, selfies are revolutionary and will continue to be so. From the first-ever selfie recorded by Robert Cornelius 175 years ago to modern-day colonization of the word “selfie” being termed by celebrities specifically Kim Kardashian. The fact is- selfies are taking a different direction, where metadata and features set the notion of beauty that is problematic. The features of social media and constant online connectivity manipulate one into access or denial because it purposefully tends to instrumentalize users’ brains, hands, mouths, ears for the purpose of commodification. Furthermore, these technologies simulate a false notion of community, connectedness and social network when on the contrary is tired to a private culture, of self-help, addiction, consuming and self-obsession toward plastic surgery.

Therefore, when an influencer is acting on monetizing her services, and commodification of the self based on “giveaways,” YouTube review, and everyday lifestyle has perceived credibility, reliability, and authenticity when addressing a brand, a product, or an issue. Thus, one can conclude the commodification of the self can have dangerous implications when the artist becomes an extension of the brand because of the narcissism that rise of selfishness part driven by the capital inclination to be recognized that often lacks boundaries and limitations e.g. Toronto Chair Girl. Therefore, creating sources of insecurity, anxiety, and feeling of preciousness when part of a capitalist segmentary society by constantly trying to gain value (recognized)- a typical attribution of neoliberalism (Giroux, 2015).

Lastly, most research pertaining to the commodification of the self, does not imply icons such as Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian’s insights whom have contributed to the culture that revolves around feeling confident with one’s self, and body. Not to mention the fact that celebrity culture and the 2000s are historical to understanding the commodification of the self because the desire to be loved, recognized and famous used to come from talent, skill sets and uniqueness or a person but because of this 24-hour entertainment culture reality tv allows the concept of being famous for simply being famous but had disregarded the negative implications on the years to come on the general population. Neoliberalism has the power to shift economic perspectives based on social media abilities to have a product go viral, and the aspect of objectification that impart has influencers producing a negative work-behavior (extreme fitness measures) to its audiences contributes to the desire of being famous, followed by an unregulated, false ideology of social acceptance. For future studies, rather than surveying generated questionnaires and quantitative studies based on social media usage, a focus on qualitative interview methods would excel. In addition, it would be interesting to see a social experiment showing all the psychological implications in a visual form - for the audience to understand why individuals are highly selective about what to portray. If this were to be explored categories of makeup, fashion, fitness, trends, could be evaluated particularly for interpretation of what attracts the commodification of the self apart from narcissism. And how it will affect our future psychology and the form we engage with one another on a global exchange, and circulation of producing, consuming, and discarding photos.
