Sexual orientation is biologically conferred in the first trimester of pregnancy.

Gender identity is biologically conferred during the middle trimester of pregnancy.

Health risks are conferred by the social stigma of minority status.

Gynecologic Oncologists can provide quality care to these minority individuals.

Gynecologic Oncologists are sometimes consulted to care for patients who present with diverse gender identities or sexual orientations. Clinicians can create more helpful relationships with their patients if they understand the etiologies of these diverse expressions of sexual humanity. Multidisciplinary evidence reveals that a sexually dimorphic spectrum of somatic and neurologic anatomy, traits and abilities, including sexual orientation and gender identity, are conferred together during the first half of pregnancy due to genetics, epigenetics and the diversity of timing and function of sex chromosomes, sex-determining protein secretion, gonadal hormone secretion, receptor levels, adrenal function, maternally ingested dietary hormones, fetal health, and many other factors. Multiple layers of evidence confirm that sexual orientation and gender identity are as biological, innate and immutable as the other traits conferred during that critical time in gestation. Negative social responses to diverse orientations or gender identities have caused marginalization of these individuals with resultant alienation from medical care, reduced self-care and reduced access to medical care. The increased risks for many diseases, including gynecologic cancers are reviewed. Gynecologic Oncologists can potentially create more effective healthcare relationships with their patients if they have this information.

Gynecologic Oncologists sometimes care for patients with diverse sexual orientations and gender identities. Understanding the scientific basis of this diversity helps build the therapeutic relationship necessary to optimize patient health. This manuscript synthesizes the large body of published multidisciplinary evidence on sexual orientation and gender identity, from embryology, to endocrinology, genetics, genomics, anatomy, pediatrics, psychiatry, gynecology and neurobiology. Most of these findings have been replicated by others, but have not yet been collated into a singular report for clinicians.

Both autosomal and sex genes variably express many proteins (WT1, Sf1 most notably) in the first trimester, which direct gonadal differentiation into ovaries (DAX1, Wnt4 from x chromosomes) or testes (SOX9, SRY, Fgf-9 from Y chromosomes). The gonads then begin their descent (Wnt 7a, Hox, among others), and variably release the hormones that permanently imprint the developing fetal brain, and confer physical attributes and physiologic abilities along a spectrum of “sexually dimorphic”, e. g. female-typical or male-typical, patterns [1] (see Fig. 1).

Most typically, a female fetus secretes little or no testosterone. Their external genitals remain female-like and the genital tubercle stops enlarging after 12 weeks. They typically identify as female, exhibit girl-like play patterns, develop feminine bone structures and body motion, and exhibit increased empathy, verbal fluency, perceptual speed and accuracy, associative memory, and a sexual orientation toward men [1].

Most typically, a male fetus secretes testosterone, which is converted to dihydrotestosterone and estradiol, imprinting the brain and causing continued growth of the genital tubercle into a phallus and continued descent of the testis into the scrotum [2]. They identify as male, exhibit boy-like play patterns, develop masculine visuospatial abilities, bone structures and body motion, vocal range, math abilities, and an orientation toward women [1]. While these differences in gender are significant as measurable population means between the two ends of the spectrum, they do not indicate any generalizable limitations on an individual's capabilities or potentials.

Since the genitals differentiate in the first trimester, and the brain becomes imprinted in the latter half of gestation, it is possible for the fetal brain to be imprinted differently than the genitals [3]. As an experimental example, male rats treated in utero with a potent estrogen/testosterone inhibitor, demonstrate female-typical sexual behavior as adults but have normal male anatomy [4]. Many other biological correlates for transsexualism have been identified.

Most often, however, the fluctuating levels of hormones and proteins during early fetal development confer a set of sexually dimorphic features as continuous variables on a spectrum, between masculine and feminine. If only the thirty-seven proteins and two hormones mentioned above can vary from high to average to low, there are 3 to the thirty-seventh power, or over 450 quadrillion [11], possibilities of variation. As children mature, this innate imprinting expresses as genital anatomy, gender identity, sexual orientation and other physiologic capabilities and natural preferences along a continuum, between masculine and feminine. Thus, the concepts of binary heterosexual or homosexual, male or female, represent the furthest ends of the spectrum, with the vast majority of humans clustered near the heterosexual and gender-congruent ends of the spectrum, and a small percent falling in between, along the many mid-points of the spectrum [2].

Prenatal hormone variations have been shown to correlate with many neurologic, physiologic and anatomic traits that typically express together and are congruent with sexual orientation and gender identity, demonstrating a mutual biological causality [1].

Girls typically have slightly longer index fingers compared to their ring fingers (high 2D:4D ratio), and boys' index fingers are relatively shorter (lower 2D:4D) [5]. While many social factors may also influence childhood behaviors, there is a significant correlation between the 2D:4D ratio and gender role play, aggression-proneness, preferred toy types, as well as both color and subject choice in drawings [6], [7], [8]. In females, a lower 2D:4D ratio correlates with lesbian orientation [9] and female-to-male transgender status [10], along with many other male-typical sexually dimorphic skills and traits [11] [12]. The 2D:4D ratio is lower, or masculinized, in females with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) also suggesting a prenatal hormonal influence [11]. Many other bone measurements of female-to-male transsexuals are in the intermediate range between male and female typical [13]. Lesbian monozygotic twins have lower 2D:4D ratios than their respective heterosexual co-twins [14]. Lower 2D:4D is correlated with increased levels of fetal testosterone relative to estradiol and insulin-like factor 3 in second trimester amniocentesis fluid, suggesting prenatal Leydig cell testosterone secretion [5], [15].

Gay male co-twins have higher 2D:4D than their heterosexual male co-twins, confirming that the digit effect was not genetic (since they are identical), but likely epigenetic, resulting in disparate internal prenatal hormonal milieus [16]. The 2D:4D ratio is higher, or feminized, in male-to-female transsexuals [17].

Studies of spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAEs) confirm that hearing is a sexually dimorphic trait. Control males, men with microphallus or similar disorders of sexual differentiation (DSD's), and women with CAH all produced fewer spontaneous SOAEs – the male typical pattern – than control females [18]. Women with Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (CAIS), having no androgen receptors, also have female-typical SOAEs [18]. The hearing of male homosexuals is less androgenized and female homosexuals more androgenized compared with heterosexual counterparts [19]. Females with opposite-sex co-twins also demonstrate masculinized hearing abilities suggesting cross-amniotic membrane transfer of amniotic fluid hormones [20]. These auditory differences correlate strongly with other sexually dimorphic traits such as aggression–proneness [6], [21], spatial ability, sexual orientation, and gender nonconformity [22].

Adult lesbians have more male-typical features such as spatial [23] and visuospatial skills [24], less body dissatisfaction [25] and lower rates of eating disorder [26], lower voice pitch [27], greater athletic and throwing skills [28], possibly lower pain thresholds [29], more ambidexterity [30] or left-handedness [31], and a higher sex drive than heterosexual women [32]. Gay males have more feminine-typical traits such as fluid body movement [33], self-objectification [34], eating disorders [35], letter and verbal fluency [36], body dissatisfaction [35], speech patterns [37], and fingerprint patterns [38].

Sexual differentiation of the brain begins in the second trimester and likely completes postnatally [7]. Because brain differentiation occurs months after differentiation of genitals, the differentiation of the body in one direction does not necessarily reflect the direction of the differentiation of the brain [39].

In 1992, Allen reported a correlation between male sexual orientation and a female-shifted or larger anterior commissure size, among the first reports suggesting a neurobiological origin for sexual orientation [25], [40], [41]. Male-to-female transgender individuals, regardless of their hormone use, also have a female-shifted or smaller volume of the central subdivision of the bed nucleus of the stria terminals (BSTc), a region typically larger in males and essential for sexual behavior [42]. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging shows widespread differences in white matter microstructure of transgender individuals measuring between that of gender-congruent males and female controls [43]. Corpus callosum asymmetry has been correlated with fetal testosterone excess and sexually dimorphic cognition and behavior [44]. Lower 2D:4D ratio is associated with masculinized reduced gray matter volume in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, the region of emotional regulation [6]. In functional brain studies, homosexual males and females demonstrate cerebral asymmetry and functional connections, known to be set by prenatal hormones, in more opposite-sex-typical patterns [45]. Female-to-male transgender individuals, who were not yet taking any androgenic hormones, also expressed male-typical cognitive function and cerebral lateralization [46].

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia and polycystic ovarian syndrome can provide important clinical evidence about the effects of excess prenatal androgen exposure in females [47].

CAH is an adrenal enzyme deficiency (C-21 hydroxylase) in the cortisone synthesis pathway, resulting in an excess of androgenic precursors in the blood [48]. It was historically called “adrenogenital syndrome”, because female infants were born with large clitorises and more male-typical play patterns, voices, and some of the skeletal structure typical for boys [49]. Many later identified as lesbian or bisexual in adulthood, and about 5–10% were transgender, particularly if their CAH was the more severe, salt wasting type [50], [51]. More recently, CAH females with prenatal androgen exposure have been confirmed to demonstrate more male-typical play behavior in childhood [8], virilized voice [27], and gynephilic dreams [52] or homosexuality in adulthood [50], [51].

PCOS is an endocrine condition comprised of lifelong elevated levels of luteinizing hormone, testosterone, androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate [53]. Females with polycystic ovaries have been observed to have more hirsutism, virilized bone structures, intersex genitals [54], same-sex orientation and female-to-male transgender status than unaffected controls [55]. Studies of female-to-male transgender individuals reveal heightened serum levels of adult male hormones, and higher incidences of PCOS [55], and CAH [50].

Females with a fraternal male co-twin can be exposed to excess prenatal androgen [56] due to testosterone from the male twin's amniotic fluid diffusing to the female's amniotic fluid [21]. This is associated with androgenized changes in play patterns [21], neuroacoustic functioning [46], bone structure [15], teeth structure [57], subsequent risk of increased alcoholism [58] and reduced eating disorders [26], brain anatomy [59], and sexual orientation [60]. In fact, males with opposite-sex co-twins have an increased chance of homosexual orientation, likely due to receptor competition through amniotic fluid crossover by estrogens from the female fetus [61].

From 1940 to 1970, the endocrine disruptor diethylstilbestrol (DES) was prescribed for women in the first trimester of pregnancy to prevent miscarriage. It increased the chances of lesbian orientation in the female offspring [62]. Even exogenous estrogens can cause mounting behavior in female rats, likely due to aromatization of the excess estrogens in the brain into testosterone [63]. In human brain tissue culture, antiepileptic drugs have been shown to enhance estrogen receptors, and can affect the sexually dimorphic nuclei [64]. Prenatal exposure to phenobarbital and phenytoin has been linked to higher rates of undescended testes, genital anomalies, male homosexuality, and male to female transgenderism [65]. Exogenous sources of androgen-like substances have been identified in steroid-supplemented fish [66], poultry [67], or beef [68], and may have unknown effects on the sexually dimorphic traits if consumed in large quatities during gestation.

Fetal testosterone levels measured from amniotic fluid of children whose behavior was later studied at age 4 showed a strong inverse correlation with empathy scores in males [69]. Reduced prenatal testosterone may be one possible etiological factor in the development of male-to-female transsexualism [17].

It is well established that the greater number of older brothers a male has, the more likely he will have been gender-atypical as a child [70], have an adult sexual orientation toward men [71], or recognize an adult androphilic transsexual identity [72]. One prevailing theory is transplacental antibody formation that accumulates an effect over time. Proteins, such as SRY, encoded from the fetal Y chromosome, cross the placenta and are believed to stimulate formation of maternal antibody directed against “foreign” male proteins [71]. With each successive male pregnancy, more antibodies are induced that ultimately reach the male fetus' circulation, blunting the serum levels or effect of androgens. In research on heterosexual men, among the 20% who reported “some” homosexual feelings, a significantly greater number of older brothers was observed [73]. More recently, some studies have suggested that a maternal immune response may also cause low fetal weight, possibly influencing sexual orientation and gender-atypical behavior and identity among males [74].

Twin studies confirm that gender identity and sexual orientation have a genetic link [75]. When a monozygotic twin is lesbian, 48% of the co-twins were also lesbian, as compared to 16% orientation concordance in dizygotic co-twins, 14% of non-twin sisters, and 6% of adopted sisters [76], [77]. Similarly, more monozygotic than dizygotic twin boys express concordance in homosexual orientation [78], [79]. In a study of 96 monozygotic pairs and 61 dizygotic pairs, gender identity dysphoria was shown to have clear hereditary correlates and no environmental correlates [80].

Epigenetic differences, the modulation of gene expression by chemical binding of inherited DNA, can account for the discordant expressions of traits in monozygotic twins [16]. Modulating the effects of excess androgens on female fetuses, and enhancing androgen sensitivity in male fetuses “canalizes” fetal development in a sex-typical fashion, reducing concordance of monozygotic twins' expression of sexual orientation [81]. Sexually dimorphic expression of certain microRNAs has been tied to sexual orientation. Androgen genes and the miRNAs involved in their regulation have been shown to have a sexuality-concordant effect [82]. These epigenetic modifications and the variability in the degree of their expression/modulation contribute to the non-binary, “spectrum” effect of sexually dimorphic traits and orientations.

Many gay males have a gay maternal uncle, suggesting some association with the maternally inherited X chromosome. Homosexual orientation among males has been correlated with the gene Xq28, on the long arm of the X chromosome [83]. A recent study of over 700 men, half of whom were gay, showed a significant correlation between a gene in the 7q36 region with sexual orientation [84]. Other X chromosome mutations, as well as 47XYY and 47XXX, have also been correlated with gender identity dyssynchrony [85], [86], [87].

In CAIS, 46XY males have functioning undescended testes and normal testosterone levels, but a defective or absent gene for the androgen receptor. Males born with CAIS can have a micropenis [88], with partial to phenotypically complete bodily feminization [89] and are usually psychosocially female and oriented toward men [90]. Individuals with CAIS can report more gender identity dyssynchrony [91] and have a higher, more feminized, 2D:4D digit ratio [11].

5ARDS is a rare autosomal recessive condition with 33 possible mutations whereby testosterone cannot be converted to its most active form, dihydrotestosterone, essential for the formation of fetal male external genitalia [92]. Family lines with recurring offspring with 5ARDS have been identified in the Dominican Republic, Papua New Guinea, Turkey, and Egypt. An XY baby born with 5ARDS often has ambiguous or more female-typical genitals and is raised as a girl. Many have male-typical play patterns and develop a male gender identity as children [93]. Then, at puberty, with surging levels of androgens, their bodies and genitals masculinize and they will typically then identify as male [94]. This condition has been unrecognized in some individuals until long after removal of their testes and surgical reduction of their phallus into a clitoris, a practice now discouraged.

Some children are born with genitals appearing between male- and female-typical, precluding confident sex assignment at birth [90]. DSD (formerly “intersexed”) can be idiopathic, or later attributed to excessive androgen exposure in females (as with congenital adrenal hyperplasia) and lower androgens in males from genetic aberrations of the sex chromosomes, hypothalamic or gonadal dysfunction, CAIS, or 5ARDS, above.

The historical approach to ablatio penis [95], or penile agenesis [96], or to children with ambiguous genitals (small phallus or macroclitoris) was to surgically shorten the glans, remove the testes and assign the child to be a girl. Prepubertal surgery to shape the ambiguous female genitalia into a clitoris has resulted in gross adult genital disfigurement, arousal and orgasmic dysfunction, and permanent psychologic injury [97]. The more ethical modern approach is support and education of the concerned family, allowing the child to mature and express their gender identity, and offer surgical modification only to the consenting adolescent or adult [49], [98].

While genetics, epigenetics and prenatal hormones begin to explain the diversity of sexual orientation and gender identity, the underlying causes are unknown for the vast majority of homosexuals, gender nonconforming persons and individuals with DSD.

Heterosexual, homosexual and transsexual individuals report that they are certain they were “born that way”, and prefer their status [99]. Bisexual individuals are born with an orientation nearer the center of the spectrum, attracted to both men and women, though not necessarily equally, or always. To date, no social, or environmental effect has been significantly correlated with orientation or identity. From neuroanatomist Simon Levay in the April 2011 issue of Frontiers of Neuroendocrinology, “The book on social influences [on sexual orientation and gender identity] is not closed, so much as it is blank” [75]. From neuroscientist D. F. Swaab in Functional Neurology: “There is no proof that social environment after birth has an effect on gender identity or sexual orientation” [3]. The American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from a psychopathological designation in 1973 [100]. In the 2013 DSM-5, the American Psychiatric Association affirmed that “gender nonconformity is not in itself a mental disorder, but a discontent with the assigned gender and the apparent gender of their bodies” [101]. Since then, sexual orientation and gender identity have gradually become protected as statuses that should not endure discrimination or lack of accommodation by state and federal laws [102].

Convenience survey data from the 1980's revealed that lesbians frequently experienced ostracism, rough treatment, and disdain from their medical practitioners [103]. As a result, many lesbians did not disclose their orientation to their physician, and withdrew from routine health maintenance visits [104]. A survey of California physicians in 1986 revealed that about 23% had significantly negative attitudes toward their homosexual patients [105]. At that time, most medical schools provided under three hours training about issues of orientation and none on transgender status [106].

In 1995, presentations of snowball survey data were made to members of the Department of Health and Human Services which revealed that lesbians appeared to have more risk factors for heart diseases and cancers than heterosexual women. Presenters requested that more valid health information of this minority group be provided through ongoing nationally-funded probability surveys by including a question about sexual orientation [107]. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) convened a committee in 1997 which confirmed that lesbians as a minority population did deserve research focus by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) [108]. Three years later, with no national probability studies reporting any demographic information about lesbian citizens, the Office of Research on Women's Health in the NIH convened the Scientific Workshop on Lesbian Health to study how the IOM Report could finally be implemented [109]. In 2001, the NIH requested that all ongoing NIH-funded national probability projects stratify their demographic data by sexual orientation, especially those focusing on HIV, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, infectious diseases, life-span development, and mental health [110]. The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) subsequently piloted a question of sexual orientation to some of its participants. Upon finding the very question inoffensive to their research participants, the WHI included a question of sexual orientation in its final survey instrument [111]. The Nurses' Health Survey (NHS) similarly included a question of sexual orientation, with both surveys providing a high-quality demographic of lesbians' health issues in the new millennium [112].

Social issues through the lifespan

Children as young as 10 years old can recognize their burgeoning attraction to a particular gender [113]. By high school, about 10% of Minnesota girls say they are unsure about their orientation, with 4.5% reporting lesbian attraction and 1% having engaged in lesbian behavior [114]. The Committee on Adolescence of the American Academy of Pediatrics states that while homosexual youth are attempting to reconcile their feelings with some of the negative societal attitudes, they still must then

The evidence shows that both orientation and identity are biologic features that co-vary with a very large number of other biologic sexually dimorphic traits. All of these sexually dimorphic traits are innate, immutable and innocent human features with cultural impacts that may result in disparate health maintenance and higher risk for cancer and heart disease. Gender-atypia or homosexuality do not themselves lead to social pathology, drug abuse, suicide, sex-work or HIV infection; rather, the

Caring for the transgender adolescent and young adult: Current concepts of an evolving process in the 21st century

2019, Disease-a-Month

These males report more gender identity dyssynchrony and orientation toward men.26 In another rare autosomal recessive condition (i.e., 5 alpha-reductase deficiency syndrome [5ARDS]), testosterone is not converted to its active form, dihydrotestosterone, that is essential for the development of the fetal male external genitalia; these infants are born with ambiguous genitalia and are often raised as girls.26,36 Exogenous sources of hormones add to the concept of hormonal etiology.

The term transgender youth commonly refers to those whose gender identity, or personal core sense of self as a particular gender, differs from their assigned sex at birth; this is often designated by what external genitalia are present. These youths are presenting to multidisciplinary clinics worldwide at exponentially higher rates than in decades past, and clinics themselves have grown in number to meet the specialized demands of these youth. Additionally, the scientific and medical community has moved towards understanding the construct of gender dimensionally (i.e., across a spectrum from male to female) as opposed to dichotomous or binary “male or female” categories. This is reflected in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM 5); in this publication, the diagnostic classification of gender dysphoria, GD, (which has two subtypes: childhood and adolescence/adulthood) provides a set of criteria that many transgender people meet. GD describes the affective distress that arises as a result of the incongruence between gender identity and sex anatomy. The DSM uses language to indicate that a person may identify as another gender instead of the other gender, which further captures the complexity of the human experience of gender. Also, research regarding how current adolescents are describing their identity development and experience along this spectrum within today's society is only now being addressed in the literature. Therefore, the clinical needs of the transgender population have outpaced medical training and scientific advancement, which has opened up gaps on how to define best practices. This article provides current concepts of evaluation and management for transgender persons with emphasis on hormonal therapy (i.e., puberty blockers and gender affirming hormone therapy). Other management issues are briefly considered including gender confirming surgery and changes in the face as well as voice.

Overview of care for transgender children and youth

2019, Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care

Over the past decade, more and more children and adolescents are identifying as transgender and gender diverse (TGD). Often, they and their parents first turn to their primary care pediatrician for guidance and support. Therefore, in 2018, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) released a policy statement focusing on the health care of TGD youth.4 The AAP acknowledges that many pediatricians have a lack of training in this area and therefore need to increase their knowledge base and expertise in order to provide culturally competent care. While most sexual and gender minority individuals are healthy and well adjusted, some TGD youth are at an increased risk of mental health concerns, including anxiety, depression, substance abuse, eating disorders and suicidality. This is theorized to be due to the experienced or internalized marginalization, stigmatization, victimization, harassment or rejection and not inherent in having gender dysphoria or being transgender. The pediatrician therefore needs to be knowledgeable of, and skilled to screen for, the health disparities that may exist, as well as to be able to support the individual who may disclose their gender identity status during treatment. Parents and guardians may also turn to the pediatrician for guidance when faced with their child who presents with gender non-conforming behaviors or gender dysphoria. Therefore the pediatrician needs to be able to guide the parents as well, as their acceptance and support of their child's journey to gender identity is probably the most important protective factor against health disparities encountered. To deliver optimum care for TGD children and youth, the pediatrician needs to establish an office setting that is inclusive, gender-neutral and TGD friendly. By becoming familiar with the diversity of gender expression and identities, use of gender-appropriate terminology, health disparities often encountered and the importance of providing a safe and welcoming environment, issues that are all covered in this article, the primary care pediatrician will be in position to provide comprehensive health care to this often marginalized population.

Stress: Influence of sex, reproductive status and gender

2019, Neurobiology of Stress

Emerging evidence from the preclinical and human research suggests sex differences in response to different types of stress exposure, and that developmental timing, reproductive status, and biological sex are important factors influencing the degree of HPA activation/function. Here we review data regarding: i) sex differences in behavioral and neural responses to uncontrollable and controllable stressors; ii) distinct trajectories of behavioral development and HPA-axis function in male and female rats following adolescent stress exposure; iii) normative changes in behavior and dopamine function in early postpartum rats; iv) aberrant HPA-axis function and its link to abnormal behaviors in two independent, preclinical mouse models of postpartum depression; and, v) data indicating that gender, in addition to sex, is an important determinant of stress reactivity in humans. Based on these findings, we conclude it will be important for future studies to investigate the short and long-term effects of a wide variety of stressors, how these effects may differ according to developmental timing and in relation to gonadal function, the relationship between aberrant HPA-axis activity during the postpartum and mood disorders, and influences of both sex and gender on stress reactivity in humans.
