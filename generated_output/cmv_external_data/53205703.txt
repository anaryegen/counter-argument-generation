Evidence suggests that higher testosterone levels may provide an athletic advantage. Therefore, it is of practical interest to examine the association between testosterone levels and power- and strength-related traits in young professional track and field athletes, and to consider the factors that determine testosterone levels. The study involved 68 young professional athletes (45 females, 17.3 ± 2.6 years; 23 males, 18.2 ± 1.9 years). Testosterone levels were assessed via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. All subjects performed two 20 m and two 30 m sprint trials, and countermovement jump without arm-swing. A bioimpedance analysis of body composition was carried out and biological maturity was examined using the Khamis-Roche method. The average testosterone levels were 26.4 ± 9.6 nmol/l and 1.5 ± 0.7 nmol/l in males and females, respectively. In female athletes, testosterone levels did not correlate with any of traits. Males with the highest testosterone levels were significantly faster in the 20 m (p = 0.033) and 30 m (p = 0.014) sprint trials compared to males with lower testosterone levels. Testosterone levels in males were positively associated with fat mass (p = 0.027), and degree of biological maturation (p = 0.003). In conclusion, we found a positive relationship between testosterone levels and sprint performance in young male athletes.

The association between endogenous testosterone and strength/power and speed is well-known [1]: i.e., higher testosterone levels are associated with greater strength/power and faster speed. Testosterone is considered one of the most important factors when explaining the differences between men's and women's sporting results, which can range from 10 to 20% performance difference [2]. In specific sports where muscle mass and/or explosive power are especially important, this sex difference can reach as high as 50% [3]. Similarly, testosterone can provide a competitive advantage for female athletes, by increasing muscle mass, power, stimulating erythropoiesis, promoting competitive behavior and as such improving physical performance [[2], [4]]. Furthermore, it has been reported that testosterone is responsible for the sex differences in visuo-spatial neural activation, which may partially explain the advantage that athletes with hyperandrogenism have in sports where visuo-spatial abilities are closely associated with improved performance [5].

The positive effect of increased testosterone concentrations on athletic performance may be associated with improved physical performance and on several psycho-emotional factors, such as motivation, focus and dominance [6,7]. In this regard, it is not surprising that female athletes with high levels of androgens (endogenous or exogenous origin) are purported to have a 2 to 5% advantage compared to female athletes within the typical female range of androgens [5]. Previously, this notion has been supported, highlighting that in elite female athletes, higher concentrations of free testosterone provided an advantage, at least in the 400- and 800 meter run, 400 meter hurdles, pole vault and hammer throw [8]. Similar data were obtained by Akhmetov et al. [9] who, after analyzing data from nearly 600 female athletes, showed that testosterone concentrations were positively associated with athletic success in elite sprinters and that 50% of elite sprinters had testosterone levels >1.9 nmol/l, while less successful sprinters had testosterone levels <1.9 nmol/l.

In developing athletes, the concentration of endogenous testosterone does not differ between the sexes at ages of ∼6–10 years old [10]. Although there is an increase in testosterone concentration in the early teen years, which, most likely, supports a rapid improvement in athletic performance in male adolescents (aged 12 years and older) when compared to their female counterparts and younger males [10]. In girls, testosterone concentrations do tend to increase with puberty, but to a much lesser extent [11]. According to Senefeld et al. [11] the average testosterone concentration in girls aged 6–20 years old increases from 0.08 nmol/l to 1.02 nmol/l with a plateau at ∼14 years old. However, their male peers (6 to 20 years old) experience a sharp rise (0.07 nmol/l to 17.9 nmol/l) in testosterone levels to the age of 20 years, with a gradual plateau initiating at 17 years old. This difference in testosterone concentration levels may in part explain the enhanced results reported by 17-year-old male swimmers compared to female swimmers, although at 10 years old there is negligible difference between boys and girls in performance and testosterone concentrations [11].

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has previously stated that testosterone concentration must be <10 nmol/l for at least 12 months prior to and during competition as a threshold for female athletes’ participation [12]. These regulations have been in place since 2015. Simultaneously, World Athletics have set female athlete participation criterion of testosterone levels in some disciplines at <5 nmol/l. However, notably, the scientific community is not in total agreement or support of this regulation [13,14].

In light of the prior, the purpose of the present study was to assess testosterone concentrations in a group of young professional athletes and to examine the correlation between total testosterone and the explosive physical qualities of power and speed. We hypothesize that testosterone concentration correlates with power and speed measures in young professional athletes regardless of sex.

The current investigation collated data from a cohort of 68 young professional athletes from an elite European “Academy of Talents” during the August 2021 training camp. Athletes were considered as professional, as athletics was their primary occupation for financial reward, and they were studying in a specialized sports school.

All subjects had no contraindications and had participated in athletics for 3–13 years. All athletes were selected by a special expert council, consisting of five elite

Height, weight, BMI and testosterone concentration were significantly greater in male than female athletes (p < 0.023). There was no statistically significant difference in age between males and females (p = 0.15). Male athletes also demonstrated greater power and faster sprint speed, and had a higher phase angle and more muscle mass (Table 1) than their female counterparts. The degree of biological maturation in athletes between the ages of 13 and 18 years, defined as a percentage of predicted

The present study aimed to assess the testosterone concentrations in a group of young professional athletes and to examine the correlation between total testosterone and the explosive physical qualities of power and speed. The analysis was conducted to assess within- and between-sex differences of testosterone concentration and physical performance measures. Taken together, the results showed that the levels of testosterone concentration in young female athletes are much lower than the upper

Our study appears to be one of the first to assess the relationship between testosterone level and power, speed and body composition in young professional athletes, employing the LC-MS method, which is regarded as the most reliable method to determine testosterone levels. Although our findings did not support our hypothesis, that testosterone concentration correlates with power and speed measures in young professional athletes of either sex, further studies are warranted with larger samples of

The concentration of total testosterone in young professional female track-and-field athletes are within the reference values accepted for the general population and the limit set by World Athletics. In this sample of athletes, no correlational relationship was found between the concentration of testosterone and measures of power and speed, as well as body fat and muscle mass in female athletes. However, our findings support male athletes with higher testosterone levels did perform better in

Genomic predictors of physical activity and athletic performance

2024, Advances in Genetics

Physical activity and athletic performance are complex phenotypes influenced by environmental and genetic factors. Recent advances in lifestyle and behavioral genomics led to the discovery of dozens of DNA polymorphisms (variants) associated with physical activity and allowed to use them as genetic instruments in Mendelian randomization studies for identifying the causal links between physical activity and health outcomes. On the other hand, exercise and sports genomics studies are focused on the search for genetic variants associated with athlete status, sports injuries and individual responses to training and supplement use. In this review, the findings of studies investigating genetic markers and their associations with physical activity and athlete status are reported. As of the end of September 2023, a total of 149 variants have been associated with various physical activity traits (of which 42 variants are genome-wide significant) and 253 variants have been linked to athlete status (115 endurance-related, 96 power-related, and 42 strength-related).
