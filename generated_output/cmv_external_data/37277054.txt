Here‚Äôs what else to consider

Transparency and openness are essential values for any team that wants to collaborate effectively, foster trust, and achieve shared goals. However, promoting these values can be challenging, especially in remote or hybrid settings, where communication and feedback can be limited or distorted. As a facilitator, you can use some strategies to help your team members be more transparent and open with each other and with external stakeholders. Here are some ways to do that.

1 Define expectations

One of the first steps to promote transparency and openness is to clarify what they mean for your team and what behaviors and practices support them. You can facilitate a session where you co-create a team charter or a set of norms that define how your team will communicate, share information, make decisions, give and receive feedback, and handle conflicts. You can also align your team's expectations with the expectations of your clients, sponsors, or other parties that you need to report to or collaborate with.

Transparency can promote accountability. When employees know that their actions are being monitored and evaluated, they are more likely to take ownership of their work. Transparency can also build trust. Open communication can lead to happier employees, which is essential to the running of any successful business. Make transparency a company policy Lead by example Create communication channels Hold meetings for questions Give employees access to information Be clear about decision-making Involve employees in decision-making Other ways include: Modeling the behaviors and attitudes you expect from others Making it clear what employees are responsible for Communicating honestly with employees ‚Ä¶see more

It's really very simple: Be open & transparent yourself. People follow good examples. LinkedIn is demanding more BS here - academese, useless theory; but the simple fact is that the most effective method is to just be the behavior you want from others. ‚Ä¶see more

There‚Äôs a critical step before this that is ESSENTIAL for making any kind of progress. Understanding the level of psychological safety that exists in the team - including (and especially) for remote team members is a precursor designing this type of session. For transparency and openness to exist and then be strengthened, team members must believe that they will not be punished for speaking up or offering alternative views. Amy Edmondson has researched this topic extensively and provides really helpful frameworks for creating dialogue around this in her book ‚ÄúThe Fearless Organisation‚Äù ‚Ä¶see more

A key to fostering transparency and openness on a team is avoiding and discouraging pre-meeting meetings. These gatherings among certain members can create toxic alliances and erode trust. Even if others are unaware, the atmosphere of the actual team meeting suffers. To truly promote trust and openness, it's best to save strategizing for the full team. ‚Ä¶see more

2 Use collaborative tools

Another way to promote transparency and openness is to use tools that enable your team to work together and access relevant information easily. For example, you can use cloud-based platforms that allow your team to co-edit documents, manage projects, track progress, and store files. You can also use tools that facilitate communication, such as video conferencing, instant messaging, and online forums. These tools can help your team to stay connected, share updates, ask questions, and provide feedback in real time or asynchronously.

Mumtaz Chaudhary, CCMP‚Ñ¢, Prosci¬Æ

I help leaders welcome change, so their organization can succeed at change.

I am a huge proponent of Microsoft Teams for this reason‚Äîyou can easily create transparency by communicating via posts (rather than email), co-editing documents, and recognizing employees using the Praise feature. I also like the ability to do quick polls using Forms so I can get a pulse on my team and adjust my communication style when needed. ‚Ä¶see more

There are many great tools to be used to help with collaboration. In addition to the technical aspects such as Zoom or Teams, texting apps, project platforms, a collaborative tool could also include behavioural/thinking models where we gain greater understanding of those we are collaborating with. Collaborating requires respect for differing opinions and being open to new ideas. ‚Ä¶see more

When using tools, start simple. If making a list on a shared screen does the trick, that¬¥s enough. If you need to collaborate, use collab tools like Miro / Mural. Need to plan work together? Try using Trello. Don¬¥t exaggerate with the tools. There¬¥s no need to give everyone full office 365 access with different groups in teams for a very simple project. ‚Ä¶see more

3 Encourage feedback

Feedback is a vital component of transparency and openness, as it helps your team to learn, improve, and resolve issues. As a facilitator, you can encourage feedback by creating a safe and supportive environment where your team members feel comfortable to express their opinions, suggestions, and concerns. You can also model feedback by giving and asking for feedback regularly and constructively. Moreover, you can facilitate feedback sessions where your team can review their work, celebrate their achievements, and identify areas for improvement.

I've been using something called User Manuals with my teams, and it's been a game-changer! A User Manual humanizes you in a quirky way, offering insights into how to collaborate more effectively. It's like your cheat code for empathy, trust, and patience. I often tell my teams, "Think of it as a TL;DR version of what makes you 'you.'" üòâ It can have things like: ‚û°Ô∏è My life story in a tweet or 100 words ‚û°Ô∏è Expectations for my team members ‚û°Ô∏è 3 favourite books (relevant to our work) ‚û°Ô∏è Communication preferences & working hours ‚û°Ô∏è What energizes me vs. drains my energy ‚û°Ô∏è Personal quirks ‚û°Ô∏è What people often misunderstand about me Give it a try! ‚Ä¶see more

Especially if it comes from a position of care and concern, feedback is a gift! During meetings or trainings - check up with the attendees: ask them how they are and at the middle of the session ask if they absorbed all the topics or invite questions or additional insights or inputs. To make it more interactive, ask questions that would test understanding. ‚Ä¶see more

4 Share successes and challenges

Another way to promote transparency and openness is to share successes and challenges with your team and with external stakeholders. Sharing successes can help your team to recognize their value, appreciate their efforts, and boost their morale. Sharing challenges can help your team to seek support, learn from mistakes, and overcome obstacles. You can facilitate sharing sessions where your team can showcase their work, acknowledge their contributions, and discuss their difficulties. You can also help your team to communicate their results, insights, and lessons learned with their clients, sponsors, or other parties.

James Hea, MBA, CCA, CTTM

Consciousness Advisor | Organizational Development | Leadership Development

Creating a safe place to fail is probably the most important element I use when working with my team. It is so important to acknowledge that all of us make mistakes. What is key then is to allow the team to share how they came through similar mistakes and then how we can collectively come up with a way forward. This often becomes a learning experience for the whole team and an opportunity to display the strengths of the team. In sharing, each member comes with their own perspective, widening the perspectives of each member of the team. This further establishes trust. With successes it is good to have a time in the week where we collectively share our successes or highlights. That can be either something we learned or something executed. ‚Ä¶see more

Agree with James below that learning from failure is invaluable. Teams need to take calculated risks to grow and that means mistakes are part of the path. Really important to champion and celebrate success along the way (not waiting until project complete), and problem solving together creates an innovative environment. ‚Ä¶see more

5 Address issues and conflicts

Transparency and openness can also be promoted by addressing issues and conflicts that may arise in your team or with external stakeholders. Ignoring or avoiding these issues and conflicts can damage trust, collaboration, and performance. As a facilitator, you can help your team to identify and address issues and conflicts by using tools such as issue logs, conflict resolution models, or mediation techniques. You can also help your team to communicate and negotiate with external stakeholders by using tools such as stakeholder analysis, communication plans, or win-win strategies.

Some managers think that work issues or conflicts will die on its own so they would avoid talking about it. What they don‚Äôt realize is by sweeping things under the rug, problems don‚Äôt just remain unresolved but also, it provokes other issues to arise. This is one of the reasons why managers should be well-trained in handling difficult conversations and be ready with being in uncomfortable situations as this allows them to address issues/conflicts with urgency. ‚Ä¶see more

I find that creating WOW (ways of working) together and sharing expectations across the whole team creates a dialogue of how the team want to interact. It is valuable to create a conflict process with the team before conflict arises so that individuals can be supported by understanding the process. ‚Ä¶see more

6 Foster a learning culture

Finally, you can promote transparency and openness by fostering a learning culture in your team. A learning culture is one where your team members are willing to share their knowledge, skills, and experiences, as well as to learn from others. A learning culture can help your team to grow, innovate, and adapt to changing needs and contexts. As a facilitator, you can foster a learning culture by creating opportunities for your team to learn together, such as workshops, webinars, or mentoring sessions. You can also encourage your team to reflect on their learning, document their learning, and apply their learning to their work.

It's about creating an safe environement where individuals and teams are motivated and empowered to acquire new knowledge, skills, and insights.

Partner at THNK I Expert at WEF I Published Author

I find that teams lack transparency and openness when either of two things are lacking: 1) a clear, common and agreed shared goal. Quite often senior executive teams lack clarity on why they are a team in the first place, more than just a set of different individuals or functions reporting into the same person. Creating a shared purpose and agenda can really help to increase collaboration, understanding and therefore transparency and openness. - Trust between team members: over time, small issues can build up or feedback opportunities can be missed, leading to erosion of trust. Spending real time together, getting to know each other, learning the different perspectives and having difficult conversations can really help to restore this. ‚Ä¶see more
