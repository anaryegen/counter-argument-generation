What are the risks of corporate social responsibility?

CSR involves risks like reputation damage, legal liability, and resource depletion. It’s important to understand your business’s social and environmental impacts before starting any CSR program. Engage stakeholders transparently, align strategies with your values, and maintain legal compliance. Regular audits, clear reporting, and performance reviews are necessary.

What are the four major issues in corporate social responsibility?

CSR’s main types are:

Environmental responsibility

Ethical responsibility

Philanthropic responsibility

Economic responsibility

Each type focuses on different areas of commitment, such as sustainability, fair treatment, social betterment, and making financially ethical decisions. Engaging in CSR improves customer and employee satisfaction, financial outcomes, and public image.

Why corporate social responsibility can backfire?

CSR can raise customer expectations of fairness, leading to backlash if prices are increased. Ironically, customers skeptical of CSR efforts are less critical of price hikes. Clear communication about the company’s market and social actions can mitigate backlash by separating CSR image from price fairness expectations. Transparency is key.
