Created bymeekermacy

Terms in this set (8)

Context takes two major forms. What are they?

Literary context and historical-cultural context

What is the crucial interprative principle?

For our interpretation of any biblical text to be valid, it must be consistent with the historical-cultural context of that text.

What is Historical-cultural context?

This kind of context involves the biblical writer, the biblical audience, and any historical-cultural elements touched on by the passage itself. Historical-cultural context refers to just about anything outside the text that will help you understand the text itself.

What are some things to consider when looking into the Biblical Writer?

What's the writer's background? Where does he come from? when does he write? What kind of ministry does he have? What is his relationship with the people he addresses? Why is he writing?

What do you need to know about the Biblical audience in order to have a clear understanding of the text?

You need to know something about the Biblical audience and their circumstances.

What are some other historical-cultural elements?

historical, social, geographical, religious, political, and economic elements that shape your passage?

What are three dangers associated with studying background?

1. watch out for inacurate background information. 2. Don't elevate the background of the text above the meaning of the text. 3. Be cautioned you do not let yourself slowly evolve nothing more than a walking database of ancient facts. (only use it as a tool to help grasp and apply the meaning of the biblical text.)

What are two tools to help identify the historical-cultural context:

1. to grasp the historical-cultural context of the book that contains your passage. 2. recognize the historical-cultural context of the passage itself.
