Glossary of Working Definitions and Terms

The following glossary presents key terms frequently used in discussions about diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). The terms are defined according to how they are used in these contexts; thus, the definitions here may differ from other known definitions. Similarly, the language society uses to talk about DEI is likely to grow and change as we better understand one another. As such, this glossary is a living document and will be updated to reflect the evolution of our understanding of diversity, equity and inclusion. Some definitions are paraphrased or updated. We hope that this glossary will be helpful to your efforts to engage in discussions of DEI topics in your communities and advance equity.

People of Color – A collective term for individuals of Asian, African, Latinx and Native American backgrounds with the common experience of being targeted and oppressed by racism. While each oppressed group is affected by racism differently and maintains its own unique identity and culture, there is also the recognition that racism has the potential to unite oppressed people in a collective of resistance. For this reason, many individuals who identify as members of racially oppressed groups also claim the identity of being People of Color. This in no way diminishes their specific cultural or racial identity; rather it is an affirmation of the multiple layers of identity of every individual.[viii]

Contemporary and past discrimination in the United States, and globally, has profoundly impacted the inequalities seen in society today. Also see racial equity and racial justice.

Racial Equity – Means race is no longer a predictor of outcomes, generally because of more equitable policies, practices, attitudes and cultural messages. That is, racial equity refers to what a genuinely non-racist society would look like. In a racially equitable society, the distribution of society’s benefits and burdens would not be skewed by race. Racial equity demands that we pay attention not just to individual-level discrimination, but to overall social outcomes. See also racial justice.

Structural Racism – The overarching system of racial bias across institutions and society. It is a system in which public policies, institutional practices, cultural representations, and other norms work in various, often reinforcing ways to perpetuate racial inequities. It encompasses dimensions of our history and culture that have allowed privileges associated with “whiteness” and disadvantages associated with “color” to endure and adapt over time. Examples can include the racial gap in wealth, homeownership, education, historical redlining practices among other factors.[xiv] See also Individual Racism, Institutional Racism and Systemic Racism.

Systemic Racism – An interlocking and reciprocal relationship between the individual, institutional and structural levels which function as a system of racism. These various levels of racism operate together in a lockstep model and function together as a whole system. These levels are: (1) Individual (within interactions between people), (2) Institutional (within institutions and systems of power) and (3) Structural or societal (among institutions and across society). In many ways “systemic racism” and “structural racism” are synonymous. If there is a difference between the terms, it can be said to exist in the fact that a structural racism analysis pays more attention to the historical, cultural, and social psychological aspects of our currently racialized society. See also Individual Racism, Institutional Racism and Structural Racism.

Veteran Status – Whether or not an individual has served in a nation's armed forces (or other uniformed services).

White Fragility – The state in which even a minimum amount of racial stress becomes intolerable, triggering a range of defensive moves in white people. These moves include the outward display of emotions such as anger, fear, and guilt, and behaviors such as argumentation, silence, and leaving the stress-inducing situation. These behaviors, in turn, function to reinstate white racial equilibrium. Racial stress results from an interruption to what is racially familiar.[xv]

White Privilege – The inherent set of advantages, entitlements, benefits and choices bestowed on people solely because they are white; an exemption of social, political, and/or economic burdens placed on non-white people. Generally, white people who experience privilege, both at the collective and individual level, do so without being conscious of it and may not experience socioeconomic privilege but are not hindered by the economic barriers associated with the color of one’s skin.

[i] As of 2000, "Asian" and "Pacific Islander" became two separate racial categories on the U.S. Census, replacing "Asian Pacific Islander.” See Census Data & API Identities - Asian Pacific Institute on Gender Based Violence Website (api-gbv.org).

[ii] African American Vernacular English (AAVE) is rooted in African dialects, British English dialects and Caribbean Creole English varieties introduced by slaves brought from the Caribbean. The roots of AAVE were established during the first century of the British colonization of America, in the Chesapeake Bay area (Virginia and Maryland), and later, in the Carolinas and Georgia. These linguistic patterns are a part of a cultural legacy that continues even after transatlantic slavery. Those who were enslaved invented their own separate version of English to speak to each other forming unity, identity and communication without interference from white enslavers. See Using Black Vernacular English (BVE) as a Non-Black Person Is Appropriation and The Origins of African American Vernacular English: Beginnings.

[iii] See The New York Times article "Where Did BIPOC Come From."

[iv] Critical Race Theory was first developed by a diverse group of legal scholars in the 1970s, including Kimberlé Crenshaw, Derrick Bell, and Charles Lawrence. Scholars used this set of ideas to critique legal concepts that were superficially “neutral”, such as the justice system, but in actuality masked systemic biases.

[v] Understanding Gender Expression and Gender Identity: Gender is often described as having three dimensions. First is the biological or physical dimension, which refers to a person's anatomy and assigned sex at birth. Second is a person's identity, which refers to their own internal sense of gender. Finally, is expression, or how a person outwardly presents themselves and how that presentation represents and interacts with societal and cultural stereotypes about gender. See What Is Gender Expression? and A Guide To Gender Identity Terms.

[vi] Internalized racism lies within individuals and is a direct product of a racist system. It is the private racial beliefs held by and within individuals. This form of racism occurs when a racial group oppressed by racism supports the supremacy and dominance of the dominating group by maintaining or participating in the set of attitudes, behaviors, social structures, and ideologies that undergird the dominating group’s power. For people of color, internalized racism/oppression can involve believing in negative messages about oneself or one’s racial group. For white people, internalized privilege can involve feeling a sense of superiority and entitlement or holding negative beliefs about people of color. See Donna Bivens, Internalized Racism: A Definition (Women’s Theological Center, 1995).

[vii] First coined by Professor Kimberlé Crenshaw in 1989, intersectionality describes the ways in which multiple identities intersect and cannot be disentangled. It is the acknowledgement that everyone has their own unique experiences of discrimination and oppression, and we must consider everything and anything that can marginalize people – gender, race, class, sexual orientation, physical ability, etc. Crenshaw initially used the term in reference to the struggles African American woman face within the criminal justice system that subsequently manifested themselves in the 1991 Anita Hill case. Crenshaw, who was a part of Hills legal team, saw Hill pitted against choosing between her blackness and her identify as a woman by observers of the trial who supported Thomas.

[viii] The term People of Color also refrains from the subordinate connotation of triggering labels like “non-white” and “minority.” The use of this term is still evolving and contested in public discussion due to its failure to be inclusive and how it erases the challenges different minority groups face in America. See NPR article The Journey From 'Colored' To 'Minorities' To 'People Of Color' Also See Washington Post article ‘People of color’ are protesting. Here’s what you need to know about this new identity.

[ix] There are six bases of power: reward power (i.e., the ability to mediate rewards), coercive power (i.e., the ability to mediate punishments), legitimate power (i.e., based on the perception that the person or group in power has the right to make demands and expects others to comply), referent power (i.e., the perceived attractiveness and worthiness of the individual or group in power), expert power (i.e., the level of skill and knowledge held by the person or group in power) and informational power (i.e., the ability to control information).

[x] Racial anxiety can influence behaviors and judgments in ways that contribute to significant and unwarranted racial disparities even in the absence of both conscious and implicit racial bias Additionally, in concert with implicit racial bias, racial anxiety can aggravate interracial dynamics in ways that create significant harm. See Racial Anxiety by Rachel D. Godsil and L. Song Richardson.

[xi] The National Academy of Public Administration Standing Panel on Social Equity in Governance focuses on issues of fairness, justice, and equity in a variety of public contexts, including, but not limited to education, policing, welfare, housing, and transportation.

[xii] The term SOGIE was elevated to the international stage in July 2011 after the United Nations adopted a resolution that requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights document discriminatory laws and practices against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity, as well as how international human rights law can be used to end the violence. The resolution led to the subsequent UN Report on Discrimination.

[xiii] To define structural inequality, one must first define the term “structures.” Structures, or institutions, are “social organizations that involve established patterns of behavior organized around particular purposes. They function through social norms (cultural expectations), which are institutionalized and patterned into organizations and sometimes established as rules and/or laws.”. This kind of inequality is referred to as systemic or structural racism when it is related to racial/ethnic discrimination.

[xiv] Structural racism is racial bias that occurs across institutions and society. It is the most profound and pervasive form of racism and is more difficult to locate in a particular institution because it involves the reinforcing effects of multiple institutions and cultural norms, past and present, continually reproducing old and producing new forms of racism. It is not something that a few people or institutions choose to practice. Instead, it has been a feature of the social, economic and political systems in which we all exist. See Racial Equity Tools Glossary and Aspen Institute, “11 Terms You Should Know to Better Understand Structural Racism.”

[xv] White Fragility is a term coined by Robin D’Angelo and is used to describe the privilege that accrues to white people living in a society that protects and insulates them from race-based stress. D’Angelo argues that this builds an expectation of always feeling comfortable and safe, which in turn lowers the ability to tolerate racial stress and triggers a range of defensive reactions. See White Fragility.
