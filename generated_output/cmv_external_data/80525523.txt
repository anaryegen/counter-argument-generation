Step Three: Examine the Historical-Cultural Context

Guiding Question: What did the text mean to the biblical audience?

Exegesis must precede application because: [1]

Exegetical questions must be answered before questions of theology and application can be legitimately asked.

Exegesis is the spadework for interpretation, i.e. determining meaning.

Interpretation and/or application that is uninformed by exegesis has no foundation.

1. Research the general historical-cultural setting (external context) of the selected passage.

Guiding Question: What is the relationship between the text and the world from which it emerged? Research the following:

Geographic setting – e.g., location, geographic features, climate.

Historical setting – e.g., historical period, politics, religion, economy.

Social/cultural setting – e.g., institutions, customs groups such as Pharisees, etc. concepts, customs.

2. Research the immediate background of the book

Author: Who was the author? Is the author identified specifically or implicitly in the book? Is the author identified in Jewish or Christian tradition?

Recipient(s): Who were the recipients? Are the recipients specifically or implicitly identified in the text? Does Jewish or Christian tradition identify the recipients? What was the author’s relationship with them?

Date – When did the author pen the document? Determine what if any indications are there in the text that point to a specific time? What if any indications in contemporary literature that would indicate when the document was written.

Occasion/Purpose – Does the author explicitly state a purpose for writing? What issue or issues is the author addressing? What is the author’s position on the issue or issues?

List then describe the differences (unique aspects such as cultural differences, religious differences, etc.) between the biblical audience and us, the contemporary audience. Identify specific items for further study (Background Study) and summarize the historical data.

Provide a synthesis of the meaning of the text for the biblical audience using past tense verbs and refer to the biblical audience.
