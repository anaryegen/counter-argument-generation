The answer to the global issue of climate change may be closer to home than previously thought.

Decreasing worldwide greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) requires mammoth reductions in burning fossil fuels and a ramping up of renewable energy sources. Traditional, centralized power grids with enormous power plants need time to adapt.

In the interim, decentralization and energy have started their own dance. Connectivity begins on a small scale but with large-scale implications for our energy supply. Let’s explore decentralization and energy for worldwide energy management.

Connectivity: Decentralization and Energy Explained

Traditionally, developed countries have built enormous, centralized energy infrastructure. Imagine giant fossil fuel power plants or nuclear power stations. They generate vast amounts of electricity, sending power via gigantic pylons up to 300 miles to electrical substations and into our homes and businesses. In theory, someone in Houston could turn on their lights thanks to electricity generated in a Dallas-based power station.

The idea behind centralized energy was to create electricity at the most efficient and lowest price possible, giving access to all. Tellingly, around 5% of all electricity generated in the United States is lost simply through transmission and sending it through power lines. But new technology has meant we see energy efficiency differently now.

Decentralized energy reverses the idea that bigger is better. With a decentralized system, hundreds, thousands — and even millions — of tiny, localized electricity-generating systems light up homes or businesses. They can even feed excess electricity back into the power grid. Indeed, one of decentralized energy’s great strengths will be its role in the clean energy transition to net-zero emissions to reduce our carbon footprint.

What Is a Decentralized Energy System?

A decentralized energy system, sometimes called an autonomous energy grid (AEG), generates electricity close to its consumption point.

Advances in energy technologies, especially renewable energy sources, make it financially viable and desirable for on-site electricity generation. Examples of decentralized energy systems, also called distributed energy resources (DERs), include:

Solar photovoltaic panels (solar panels), such as on a rooftop or as part of a community-based project

Small-scale wind turbines powered by wind energy

Batteries to store excess energy, including those in electric vehicles (EVs)

Pumped hydro storage or micro-hydro power stations

Thermal energy used in thermal power plants

Combined heat and power (CHP), where heat emissions from power plants are captured and reused, perhaps to heat homes or other industrial processes

Hybrid power generators or power plants that can switch between different energy sources, such as solar power and diesel-generated electricity; hybrids may also burn natural gas, liquefied natural gas, and biofuels

Biomass generators or energy from waste plants

District heating and cooling

Electricity generated on-site satisfies the needs of the home, business, or community first and foremost. That means no drawing on power from the centralized grid. If the microgrid system is renewable, that means fewer carbon emissions.

How Do Decentralized Energy Systems Work?

There are many types of decentralized energy systems. What many have in common is the need for new technology to link them.

A reliable internet connection forms the basis for decentralized energy systems. Real-time data, provided by smart meters and digitized electricity generation assets, are crucial. Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly processes this data, balancing power grids, anticipating shortfalls in renewable energy generation levels, and calculating when to fire up natural gas power plants to boost any shortfall.

Some industries build self-sufficient mini-power plants not connected to the primary grid. These could be hybrid, using renewable energy sources like solar or wind when possible. Companies switch to natural gas-powered electricity generation or another fuel on cloudy or windless days to maintain power levels.

A home system could mean a solar panel array powering the building during the day and storing any excess electricity in batteries, including that of an electric vehicle (EV). Many electric companies have incentives like feed-in tariffs, so homeowners receive money or bill credits for pushing this stored power back into the grid, including from the EV battery. One study suggests a self-sufficient home with an EV can save up to $7,641 annually compared to a natural gas-heated home.

Community systems can light neighborhoods and store excess renewable energy in battery storage systems for later use. In California, there are already non-profit organizations helping people with their off-grid choices. Germany leads the European charge, with 48.3% of its electricity coming from renewable energy, a cornerstone of decentralization.

What Are the Advantages of Decentralized Energy Systems?

￼Many decentralized energy systems are based on renewable energy systems and sustainability. The first winner is planet Earth, which would receive fewer carbon dioxide emissions, helping the climate change battle.Many decentralized energy systems are based on renewable energy systems and sustainability.

Clean energy means installing solar panels or other renewables or making existing energy policies low carbon. This could be, for example, by capturing heat that escapes during industrial processes and reusing it to heat nearby homes or in other industrial processes.

Renewables are becoming more diverse and affordable. Astonishingly, solar panels are 94% cheaper to produce now than in 1989. The more microgrids generate electricity, the lower the emissions levels we create, helping us on the path to decarbonization.

Decentralization creates an ecosystem of energy suppliers, which improves a grid’s reliability. Texans know only too well the weakness of a centralized energy system. The deadly winter storm of February 2021 saw centralized power providers fail and days-long blackouts. Decentralized systems offer a variety of generation sources; if one fails, another can step in. There’s also less overall demand on the main power grid and less energy loss down transmission lines.

Energy independence is a hot topic globally and locally. Rural communities are especially well-suited for decentralized electricity grids, bringing self-sufficiency and reliability. There are almost 800 million people globally without access to electricity, many off-grid. Decentralized energy stems would radically alter their lives.

Remote communities are ripe for decentralized energy systems. Upfront and maintenance costs to connect small islands and distant towns are enormous. A tree falling and damaging one pylon can cut off a village or town for days. That’s why local generation makes sense for many and promotes sustainability.

Electricity users become more aware of where their power comes from when using decentralized energy, encouraging energy-efficient behaviors and empowering people. They may also avoid large-scale disruptions caused by blackouts on centralized power grids.

Overall, the real-time data underpinning decentralized energy systems will improve energy efficiency, bringing in-depth insights into our energy production, consumption, and storage needs.

What Are the Disadvantages of Decentralization and Energy?

Decentralization is a crucial tool in the fight against climate change. However, the energy transition and decarbonization will not always be smooth. That’s also the case with decentralization and energy.

Firstly, not all power grids are ready for decentralization. Reliable internet connections, smart meters, and two-way power flows — generate or draw down — do not exist across all power grids.

There are potentially millions or even billions of possible connections to a smart grid, from microgrid generators to smart meters. Monitoring such gigantic datasets brings about its own challenges.

Reliance on internet-based technology, including the Internet of Things and connected devices to smart grids, opens power grids to hacking and cyberattacks. This weakness came to the fore in May 2021 when the Colonial Pipeline fell into the hands of hackers demanding ransom, cutting fuel to half of the U.S. East Coast.

Many renewable energy sources are intermittent, meaning they aren’t always consistent as they are based on natural weather patterns and availability. For example, a wind turbine isn’t very helpful on a windless day, just like a solar panel can’t capture much sunlight on a cloudy day. Fossil fuel or nuclear plants must be available to provide immediate backup until utility-scale energy storage is available.

Still, the International Energy Agency (IEA) finds that grid-scale electricity storage systems are behind the curve if net-zero emission targets are to be reached. Regulatory reforms are happening to counter this. For example, the United States Inflation Reduction Act offers an incentive via an investment tax credit to stimulate grid-scale battery storage interest.

What Is the Future of Decentralization and Energy?

The digitization of energy, from smart meters to EVs to microgrid power plants, will create new relationships between energy companies, communities, and homeowners. Those with distributed energy resources (DERs) like solar panels or energy storage systems will become “prosumers.”

Prosumers will participate in the energy markets through data-driven electricity sales or purchases, creating new business models within the energy sector. Transparent blockchain transactions may support increased trust between all stakeholders using the real-time smart grid.

Artificial intelligence’s ability to process massive datasets rapidly to aid decision-making may see its influence multiply. Data analysis might show where energy could be saved, where to place solar panels, and when to activate wind turbines.

Off-grid areas, especially in Africa and Asia, could be big players in the future decentralization market. In the first half of 2023, over 840,000 solar energy kits were sold in West Africa alone. Some $11 billion of investment is still required to connect all off-grid homes to some form of power generation by 2030.

These aspects may foster a new era of cooperation and energy sharing instead of the more one-dimensional supply and demand of centralized operations.

Decentralization and Energy: Changing How We Power Our Lives

Self-reliance and independence are two words that many people and businesses can relate to. Decentralization and energy are extensions of that thought process, ensuring people with microgrid systems have enough power with the bonus of fighting global warming.

New technology means it’s becoming more efficient to generate renewable energy locally. Furthermore, the data from these power generation sources can be processed in real-time to understand energy consumption better.

Remote communities, power-hungry industries, and eco-minded homeowners can now access clean energy rather than drawing on power plant-produced electricity from many miles away. Renewable energy, with its low carbon emissions and connectivity, turns scores of microgrids into a green energy support system for the entire power grid.

Decentralization’s real strength is its locality, empowering people about their energy usage. Because there’s no place like home, and decentralization shines a light on how to make a brighter future for all.
