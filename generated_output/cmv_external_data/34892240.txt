Is anyone else tired of the "Bruce Wayne is fake, Batman is the real personality" takes? Batman literally would not EXIST without Bruce Wayne

Open comment sort options

While I believe that ‚ÄúBatman‚Äù as a persona is an act in the same way that the public version of Bruce Wayne is, Batman is demonstrably closer to Bruce‚Äôs true self, and it has been since the death of his parents. More importantly, Bruce himself believes that Bruce Wayne is Batman‚Äôs mask, even if that isn‚Äôt entirely true and his real self lies somewhere in between

This. Bruce Wayne is what Batman wants the public sees. Batman is what Bruce Wayne wants criminals to see. The real Bruce Wayne/Batman is somewhere in the middle.

The real Bruce is oft regarded as Batman, cowl down in the batcave working on a case

The problem is that we‚Äôve hardly seen this middle point in recent years.

That‚Äôs an interesting take. I never actually thought of it that way.

That‚Äôs why I like Bales Batman so much because he understood this. You can tell that there are three distinct personas with him. Batman, public Bruce, and the genuine Bruce

I believe Alfred is the only person who sees beyond the Bruce/Batman facade. Bruce can lie to himself, but his father figure sees right through that

I think that most of his allies learn to see past the facade, Alfred just knows him the best and can see through it the most easily, so Bruce usually doesn‚Äôt bother trying to hide things from him. I also think he occasionally opens up to his closest/oldest allies, like Alfred, Dick, Barbara, Clark, and a handful of others, so they know what Bruce is like at his core even if he doesn‚Äôt show it most of the time.

That's exactly how I view it too. Bruce just really wants to beat up the type of people who killed his parents, so he constructed his Batman identity to do just that. Makes sense that he associates heavily with it as opposed to some rich boy bullshit he doesn't care about.

‚ÄúThe voice kept calling me Bruce, but in my mind that‚Äôs not what I call myself.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you call yourself?‚Ä¶ oh, yeah.‚Äù

Batman is not an act. Smh.

We all choose which parts of ourselves to display to others dependent on the situation. When Bruce Wayne goes out in public, he downplays his intelligence and awareness to avoid suspicion. When he‚Äôs out fighting crime or saving the world, he downplays anything that makes him seem vulnerable or human in general so he can still strike fear in a world where most superheroes have superhuman abilities. I‚Äôve always felt Bruce is at his most true self when he‚Äôs in the cave, where he doesn‚Äôt have to be a playboy or a superhero or a creature of the night, where he can just be a man working to protect innocent people

YourAverageEccentric

Batman is a performance and the entire concept of dressing up as Batman is about it being a performance. Otherwise he could fight crime in normal clothes.

I believe batcave is the place where he is most himself. It's the meeting place between Batman and Bruce Wayne, where he doesn't need to wear the cowl or the tux.

To an extent he is. The true Batman/Bruce lies somewhere in between and is the person we see in the Batcave with Alfred and the rest of the Batfamily.

i have always had the take that:

"Playboy Bruce" is a persona he uses.

"Batman" is another persona he uses.

Bruce Wayne is the guy who spends all his time working out and reading and training and talking to the bat family while he strategizes how to use the playboy and the bat. my feeling is probably based on Kevin Conroy and Michael Keaton's Bruces seeming most comfortable and real when in the cave, just getting some work done.

MeccAmputechture2024

Batman is not another persona. Bruce is always in Batman mode. When he trains, reads etc. With or without the mask on, he operates as Batman. It's just...WHO is Batman? Batman is compassion. Batman is vengeance. Batman is endurance, intelligence. He's multi dimensional.

Batman is, in my opinion, an external persona. it is that image and fear he projects. Batman does not use doors often because it is the image. Batman runs tireless because you can't outrun fear. Batman is a master detective and chemist.

Bruce learned escape so The Batman does not need to use doors. Bruce runs five miles a day so The Batman cannot be outrun. Bruce hits the books so the Batman effortlessly seems to know the recent advances in science.

i am dividing the idea of "Batman" being an externalized image that exists for the people and for crime and Bruce, being the man who supports the persona. Also, he cannot always be in Batman mode. He has his Playboy Bruce role as well. The one known for being urbane and quirky and committing his curious consumption and researching to charities to give to so he is not doing more harm than good.

that's how i see him.

MeccAmputechture2024

He is always in Batman mode. Master detective, chemist. That's batman. Playboy Bruce is a character like Matches Malone. But guess what he's thinking about while he's acting like a playboy? Batman stuff lol. He's not thinking about the taste of the booze or the girl on his arm. He's thinking about a case while his external self projects the handsome playboy at the party. It's all Batman 24/7. It has been this way since he was 10.

Here‚Äôs the thing, that isn‚Äôt Batman, it‚Äôs Bruce‚Äôs true self. Batman is the symbol/persona he adapted to strike fear into the hearts of criminals but what Batman does is an extension of Bruce‚Äôs desire to help people.

It‚Äôs always seemed like a lazy way to interpret the character. Too simplistic for what is such a richly complex guy. He is as much Bruce as he is Batman. If the two personas can be separated they are two threads of the same braid. Intertwined, interconnected. One serving the other and vice versa. The public persona of Bruce Wayne is the only true subterfuge, but even that I would argue represents some legitimate part of his psyche, as nebulous and hard to define as that is.

It's definitely an oversimplification, but I think it's just a concise way to explain how he's only driven by his, often self-destructive, desire for vengeance. I especially think it's a good starting point for early, solo career Batman self-identity. He doesn't want to be Bruce or anything to do with the outside world, so he claims that persona died years ago in that alley and only the spirit of revenge is left.

Then that gets softened by the introduction of the Batfamily, etc.

People use this tired old argument about how ‚ÄúBruce is the mask‚Äù but tbh it‚Äôs more complicated than that. There are not just 2 sides, there‚Äôs a 3rd side that everyone forgets about even though it‚Äôs the most important:

we have Bruce Wayne in public (douchey rich womanizer)

Batman (fearsome force of darkness who villains are horrified by and fellow heroes respect)

and then we have Bruce Wayne in private (the side that only his close loved ones see; a traumatized orphan who vows to make sure others don‚Äôt suffer like he did and pulls the strings of those other two personalities in order to do so).

Batman, as people know it, is not his true personality. Batman is a tool Bruce Wayne uses to defy death, protect the innocent and punish the wicked. It is Bruce Wayne‚Äôs courage, compassion, and humanity that fuel Batman and that is why that 2nd, more private Bruce Wayne is the real personality.

Everyone who believes that needs to read the Murderer & Fugitive storyline

Tbh you could say the oposite with the lego batman movie but that one was kinda goofy

oh I remember this lol. liked it a lot, but bro, Sasha... üò≠üò≠üò≠

In all seriousness,this is how I look at it. It‚Äôs a fake Batman and a fake Bruce. The fake Batman is the ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù he use to scare the bad guys,and the fake Bruce is the character he use in public to throw people off (that he‚Äôs Batman) you know the cornball playboy. The real him is him all the time no matter if he has on the mask or not.

Nah, you‚Äôre right about Batman not existing without Bruce but I think he died on that alley, still think Bruce should have an actual personality and not just be a playboy though, something like Telltale or BTAS

Plus in the comics due to the events of the Joker war storyline everyone found out how rich Bruce Wayne really was that he had tens of billions of dollars that have been stored away through the charities offshore accounts and anonymous shell companies.

As a result everyone in Gotham is now aware of the fact that Bruce Wayne was faking the whole Playboy persona as a result he's now having to completely retool his public persona he recently discovered that his backup personality had stored away about 3 billion dollars so Bruce has decided to buy a manner within the city and he's going to be putting the funds towards urban renewal projects.

Bruce Wayne is not a fake personality, but a fake persona he plays for the public.

In truth, I‚Äôm sure Bruce Wayne and Batman have conjoined by now. They‚Äôre the same, none are the alter ego.

Very much so. Luckily, there are plenty of stories tackling it.

I thought the real Bruce Wayne was that happy child of memory. But, now that everything has been stripped away from him, I realize that mask is not Bruce. Not at all.

I am Bruce Wayne. I always have been.

For anyone who unironically thinks that Bruce Wayne is the mask, read Batman: Ego. I think it does the best job of explaining the balance between Bruce and Batman and why it‚Äôs so important.

PermissionFearless60

Imo ‚ÄúBatman‚Äù has 3 personalities. Bruce Wayne in the public eye, Batman on patrol, and Bruce Wayne in the cave. Bruce in the Cave is his true self interacting with Alfred and Dick. Bruce Wayne in the public eye is used to throw people off and discourage connections between him and Batman.

It's a tired take that was debunked in universe years ago. But it's important because it shows how consumed Bruce is by his mission initially. It's something that should be a part of most Batmen's journies. Something for him to either grow out of (Dark Knight Trilogy) or something for him to ultimately and tragically lose to (DCAU).

I think Playboy Bruce is not Batman's mask, these personalities are both masks for the real him.

Batman serves as a symbol of fearlessness, lack of compassion for criminals, and lack of emotions. The real Bruce has emotions, fears and compassion, but this version is rarely shown. The real Bruce broke his fists and cried after the death of Dick in Injustice, the real Bruce, when he received the ring of power, first of all created his dead parents, the real Bruce took on the guise of Batman not because he wanted to play the hero, but because he wanted no one in that city to went through the tragedy that he experienced, and so on

Both ‚ÄúBruce Wayne‚Äù and ‚ÄúBatman‚Äù are exaggerated ideals that ‚ÄúBruce‚Äù wants to hold. ‚ÄúBruce Wayne‚Äù not only is the playboy, but is the main face of Wayne Enterprises and strives to portray a hopeful future for Gotham. While ‚ÄúBatman‚Äù is the symbol of fear to the criminal underworld and hero of the night that defends the innocent. The true ‚ÄúBruce‚Äù I believe is when he is with friends and family like the Justice League and Bat-family.

The playboy is a persona.

I am reminded of a Mark Waid JLA story where Batman was split into Batman and Bruce Wayne. O‚ÄôBrien (Plastic Man) mentioned that everyone thought that means you get a violent maniac and a personality less doormat. Which they did. But not how they expected.

Bruce Wayne had the rage, but needs Batman to focus it. Batman was just there without Bruce.

It‚Äôs so stupid and tiring it just screams edgelord

Well, not to dispute your whole point, but the notion that Batman wouldn't exist without Bruce Wayne is something I can dispute, as it relates to who the "real" person is.

Clark Kent would not exist without Kal-El, but that doesn't mean that that guy is forced to retain Kryptonian mannerisms and have us call that his "real" personality.

Similarly, I was "Bobby Saccaro" when I was born (hence the screen name) but I was adopted and my name changed to Glenn Simpson and Glenn Simpson is certainly the "real me".

Whatever comes first is not necessarily who we grow to be.

Batman didn't gift golden age Dickie a plane to his birthday. Batman didn't cry together with Alfred when pre-crisis Dickie all grown up was going to the uni. Batman didn't laugh with post-crisis Jason about how he as his guardian won't let Robin stuff influence negatively his grades. Guess who was doing all this stuff? :D

Bruce/Batman is multi-dimensional. You could argue, for instance, that Bruce doesn't truly care about being "Bruce Wayne, the playboy," but I think he absolutely cares about his family's company/legacy, and some version of "Bruce Wayne" has to play into that. "Batman" can't be the guy who runs Wayne Enterprises well.

A lot of writers forget that the reason Bruce Wayne isn‚Äôt the actual persona it‚Äôs that his public face is meant to distract from his activities as Batman. Bruce isn‚Äôt Batman 24/7 nor is he the actual identity and Bruce the disguise. The playboy persona is the disguise, the man‚Äôs still Bruce Wayne who happens to be Batman.

In the most simple of forms, Bruce Wayne‚Äôs public persona is his ‚Äúcustomer service voice‚Äù.

Ok, Batman wouldn‚Äôt exist without Bruce Wayne. That doesn‚Äôt mean Batman‚Äôs not the dominant personality.

Exactly...the batman persona took over any desire for him to be Bruce Wayne other than keeping up appearances to protect his alter ego.

Yes, they are both important. Bruce Wayne helps victims of crime through the Victims Incorporated Program and works to prevent the conditions that allow crime to flourish through the Wayne Foundation. Batman is needed to fight active crime, especially supervillains.

Bruce Wayne and Batman are both a public mask and the real face. They are two sides of the same coin, and are what make him a full and round character. It is why Dent is actually the perfect villain for him at a personal level.

I don‚Äôt think the ‚ÄúBatman is his true self‚Äù take is entirely wrong, but I think it greatly oversimplifies what‚Äôs going on. His true persona is probably a bit closer to who he is as Batman, but the intimidating creature of the night is to an extent an act as much as Bruce Wayne‚Äôs public persona is. The true Bruce/Batman is the one we see with those he trusts and cares about most, such as Alfred, Dick, Selina, Clark, etc.

Bruce Wayne is Batman and Batman is Bruce Wayne.

Duh Bruce Wayne came first but it's not about if Bruce Wayne is made up or not its just that Batman sees himself as Batman, that's all it is.

Charming-Horror-6371

Hot take, they‚Äôre the same guy

If Batman was the only real personality, then back-up personality Zur-En-Arrh wouldn't have been any different than regular ole Batman when he showed up.

Necessary-Corner1172

Bruce is the man and Batman is the mission.

And when he said "I'm Batman" when he was tied with the lasso or truth... Oh come on

Bruce Wayne died in the alleyway as an 8 year old boy with his parents. From then-on, he was ‚ÄúVengeance Incarnate‚Äù until he was able to focus his efforts through the portrayal of ‚ÄúThe Batman.‚Äù

Nope. Not tired of it. I think the idea that Bruce died with his parents is psychologically better storytelling. That he became someone else entirely, be that Batman or a different Bruce is more consistent.

I‚Äôd say having it so Batman is Bruce‚Äôs sort of alter ego is a good idea but not so much that one alter ego is more real than the other

Completely agree. I prefer to see Batman as the manifestation of the scar trauma borne by an eight year old who watched his parents get gunned down.

I loved Bruce Wayne fugitive where this originated from. Such a good storyline and damn, he was unstable back then. Lol

Bruce was born, Batman was made.

iYeah I really don't agree with it, I don't think either persona is exactly a lie, he plays it up as Bruce Wayne but he also does as Batman. To me he is somewhere in-between, the real him isn't the Batman that the police or his rogues see, but it also isn't the Bruce Wayne that his stakeholders see in board meetings; but in the same vein neither persona isn't him. To me it can be equated to how you act differently with your Grandparents to your best friend, you aren't lying about who you are in either situation, but you're displaying a different part of your personality. The real, true Bruce Wayne to me is who he is with Clark, Diana, Alfred, Dick and the Batfamily, or at least when he opens up to them. He's a complex person and he certainly gets lost in being Batman often, which is the plot of Batman Ego. But he still is Bruce Wayne, there is apart of him that is that regular person and its not entirely a fa√ßade, he just often loses it in the heat of his vengeance. Bruce Wayne and Batman are both just hyper-exaggerated facets of his true personality that he puts on.

I think Bruce Wayne is just a guy that does things

Not really. Batman is an expression of Bruce Wayne, more than just a tool or persona, much like Bruce Wayne can be. The truth is somewhere in the middle and Bruce in many stories struggles to find where that middle is. It makes for compelling stories when Bruce struggles or questions his identity. Only later in his career does he generally put the question to rest. Its a lifelong struggle for him.

You might be taking things just a tiny bit too literally.

People say Bruce never grew up after that night in crime alley.

I think Bruce's character struggle is finding the balance between the bat and the man. We see with stories like Ego and Zur-En-Arrh what a Batman devoid of Bruce Wayne is like. It's why Batman needs the Bat Family and friends like Superman, they keep him centered and from completely succumbing to the worst parts of the mask.

People can have a different option but for Bruce form Batman the animated series is my definitive Batman. He‚Äôs vengeance and he‚Äôs the night but you see that cares about the people even the people he stop and wants them to be better people

But even he says Batman is real him

You don't get it, he IS bruce wayne, however he ISN'T the rich asshole he makes people think he is

I like the way the lego batman movie did it With public bruce being a front and batman gaslighting himself to believe that he is only batman and bruce is the mask hence the iconic line ‚Äûno bruce wayne lives in batmans attic‚Äú and at the end of the movie coming to terms with his new found family and learning to let people (his family) see his true identity being bruce wayne but a more personal version of him

Implicably Pretentious said it best: "Batman is the ransom on Bruce Wayne's soul."

i am surprised there has been no episode as far as i am aware of where bruces persona and batmans persona have been split. I am like like 80% sure this happened on samurai jack but before season 5.

editt: yup season1, Episode VIII: Jack vs. Mad Jack

All of us have different variations/personas within our personality. Who we are at work is often not the person we are around our families and loved ones. One personality that adapts and shifts depending on the environment. Bruce spends most of his time as Batman, hence why this line of thinking that you mentioned is quite widespread.

DC are also quite meta, and the fact that the character‚Äôs main book is simply called Batman might offer up another explanation.

You‚Äôre right though. Bruce Wayne existed before the Batman.

Lanky_Philosophy2717

I think you misunderstand the saying. It‚Äôs meaning that how he acts as Batman is closer who he really is. His personality is obsessed over saving Gotham. Him acting as Bruce Wayne is considered the mask because he doesn‚Äôt actually like to go out and party/mingle as a playboy bachelor. His public life he plays is the facade.

Realistically though Batman isn‚Äôt truly who he is either because the Batman is seen as a cold calculating anti hero who will break anyone and do whatever it takes to get ‚Äújustice‚Äù but in reality he‚Äôs more caring about the people and genuinely wants to help people. That‚Äôs why he gives the robins a life to (in his own way) work through their trauma and why he gives criminals multiple chances and even helps some get jobs at his business (unless the writers decide they don‚Äôt want that which I personally dislike)

Oh shit Batman wouldn‚Äôt exist without Bruce Wayne?? Holy crap never thought of it that way

Actually, Batman wouldn‚Äôt exist without the death of the Wayne‚Äôs but point taken

It doesn‚Äôt mean thar Bruce Wayne the person is fake, it means the persona of Bruce Wayne, the carefree, aloof, socialite, is a an affectation. As others have stated, the Batman persona is closer to his baseline personality than the Bruce persona. That said, I think that there are aspects of the Bruce persona which are truly Bruce‚Äôs depending on the run.

I don't like the idea of a "real personality" when it comes to Batman. It's not like he has Dissociative Identity Disorder. As I see it, the hero that we call "Batman" is who he really is, while the playboy "Bruce Wayne" tends to be an act. Still, it's not like he's unable to get serious as Bruce Wayne or to smile as Batman.

I thought Bruce Wayne was Batman?

There‚Äôs batman, public bruce, and private bruce with alfred and the bat family. Bat family bruce is the real him imo

there is no real personality or fake personality, he‚Äôs a human, he‚Äôs got side to him none are fake necessarily. even playboy bruce, while played up, is still a part of his identity.
