How to promote better interfaith dialogue: what’s your advice?

About a week ago there was a thread asking “why Christians seem the least liked on this subReddit,” and the general consensus seemed to be that Christians especially struggle with interfaith dialogue. Likewise, in my own experience, I’ve had to discuss with Christians and Muslims often in this subreddit and/or in DMs that what they’re doing is proselytizing.

Obviously this isn’t just an issue with just Christians or Muslims, though, as I’ve seen plenty of similar issues crop up amongst atheists.

I generally like to believe that people are approaching in good faith, and simply don’t realize how it is they’re struggling with interfaith dialogue, so I’ve decided to open this thread in hopes of people adding their two cents on how to promote better interfaith dialogue whether it be through advice or just asking questions.

So, to start off, here’s my two cents:

The worst way to go into an interfaith dialogue is with the goal of “winning.” There’s no winning in a conversation or a debate, the only goal should be to leave the conversation having expressed the beliefs of your side, as well as walking away with a new/better understanding of the other side. If you approach the conversation with the sentiment of “I must win,” then you’ve already lost.

You’re not going to convert anyone on this sub who isn’t already seeking out different religions for conversion. Religious beliefs form over lifetimes of experience. No matter how deeply you believe in a specific religion or text - you’re not going to be able to force someone into that same belief over a Reddit debate.

Here are some counterproductive views very common to interfaith discussion on this sub.

The belief that the other person is choosing a side within your own faith system, such as polytheists who question why monotheists don't follow gods they don't believe in, or the many people who ask Satanists why we worship the devil (answer: we worship Satan, not the devil).

The belief that only your own faith is correct and/or that someone being incorrect makes them lesser (most common with Atheists, but I've seen this from many faiths including Pagans and Christians).

The belief that older religions are somehow better, especially common from people who assume resurrected faiths are modern inventions (pretty unique to criticisms of Paganism from people who believe the Christian genocide narrative).

The belief that you already understand someone else's religion, usually because they're of a denomination you're unfamiliar with. (I see this happening often with Buddhism as it comes in some very different forms, Satanism also gets this treatment thanks to political Satanism)

Don't jump down someone's throat when they express a religious perspective with which you disagree. That's seems like a good start.

I get very jumpy about interfaith dialogues. Mainly because i was raised christian, with no intention of being dragged back.

People need to stop trying to convert others. I won’t have a dialogue with someone if their only goal is to prove me wrong and switch me to their side.

If you 1000000% believe that your religion is the right one and won't accept any other viewpoint, STFU and don't take part in it.

Yeah, it's impossible to have any meaningful interfaith dialogue if that's your standpoint.

(USA) One way would be coming together around semi-religious holidays i.e. Thanksgiving Day to worship together. Where I grew up the different religions (Christian and non-Christian) would gather together on the beach at sun rise and have a Thanksgiving service. We would thank God for all the good things in our life/in our community. Each year we would end by going to one of the houses of worship's hall to have coffee and afterwards together.

This is generally true of any conversation, but I think it’s important that people actually listen when someone of another religion is sharing their faith. I think sometimes people get scared that if they hear too much about another religion, they’ll be converted or their god(s) will resent them for hearing the other person out.

This is one of the things that my mom’s Catholic parish does really well, thanks to a great administration and a super inclusive monsignor. They always thank people of different faiths at the beginning of mass and invite anyone who isn’t Catholic to participate in the Eucharist by walking up to the priest and receiving a blessing in lieu of communion, if they’re comfortable doing so. The homilies are never religiously polarizing and in fact often include anecdotes about the presider’s experiences traveling abroad and learning from people of different faiths. They also regularly fundraise for causes associated with different houses of worship.

Even though I’m not Catholic anymore, I really appreciate that I was raised in a parish where openness to and respect for other faiths goes beyond basic tolerance.

When you have the opportunity to learn about somebody else's religion, let go of any preconceived notion you may have about religion, whether it be of theirs in particular or just of religion as a whole. Approach each religion as though it is its own unique and separate entity. Avoid labelling concepts in other religions as being concepts that exist within your own religion's framework because it may not be a perfectly accurate parallel in the other's worldview. Each religion has its own distinct understanding of spirituality. In the end you may find that it is similar to other religions that you already know about but don't just assume commonalities from the start. Hinduism is not Shinto. Two separate entities with distinct origins.

At the same time, understand that ultimately, humans generally share the same core values and goals, even if the methods by which we attempt to meet those goals differ across religions and cultures. More likely than not, you have more in common with each other than you might assume. We have our own cultures as well as our own unique individual perspectives and psyches but beneath all those layers, when we are stripped to the core, we are the same. Always see yourself in the other person.

When somebody disagrees with you, don't always just assume maliciousness on their behalf. Try to understand why they think that way because there will always be an underlying core value that they are appealing to with their perspective.

Well, I been an antagonist several times here, and there are two types of situations that push me to be like that.

when people try to force others into their own religious views, with speeches like "everyone knows my god is true inside them", "you are a devil worshiper/only want to sin", "you can't have morals/meaning without my beliefs!", Or even the atheistic version "all religious people is stupid" or similar. It doesn't matter the justification for those beliefs, what kind of conversation can arise from that? For saying those kind of things there are specific subs for each group, they are not useful here.

this is an important point. Beliefs shouldn't be respected just by being beliefs, they should gain their respect as everything. In general this doesn't mean much, but the important point is that it doesn't matter from were you got your beliefs, if you have sexist, racist, discriminatory beliefs or similar, just shut it. Those beliefs should be attacked as anyone that holds them (verbally, I don't endorse physical violence). It's really taxing seeing the typical anti-lgbtq speeches, or misogynistic comments. They are never needed and only show how some people can be disgusting. And if someone wants to defend those views based on their beliefs, it's the same as if someone came and said that all muslims should die just for being muslims, or that christians should burn just for that. It's stupid, it doesn't offer anything useful, it shows the stupidity of the person holding those beliefs and nothing more. Just, abstain from commenting that, please.

I say just ignore the dicks and down vote them to oblivion. That way they'll eventually be quiet and the rest who want genuine interfaith conversations and not debates or arguments can talk.

Just act as a messenger. It isn't your job to convince and only to send a message. Whether they accept or reject the message is their problem. Too often people feel pressured that they must make the other accept or else they feel like a failure.

I find Interfaith dialogues for Christians like me tend to be pretty difficult as most non-christians seem to start off with an inherent hostility towards us. Makes a lot of Christians get rather defensive, which isn't right, but it's understandable.

I couldn’t imagine why….

And this is exactly the attitude that makes interfaith dialogue so difficult. This passive aggressive bullshit.

Edit: lol, look at me getting down voted just for mentioning the christophobia this sub exudes. Y'all just proving my point.

What exactly does "christophobia" mean on a systemic level?

Being phobic is "having an extreme or irrational fear of or aversion to something." In this case, an aversion. The way this sub reacts to Christians seems to be with and extreme aversion. Thus is undoubtedly phobic.

As for a systemic level, a good example of this would be Bill H.R.5. it forces church run schools to accept and teach post modern ideas and sexuality, it mandates what can be taught about the faith at these schools, it forces faith based hospitals to perform morally abhorred acts such a abortion, even mandates them to perform lesser stuff such as gender transitions despite the fact these things are a breach of the faith, etc.

The destruction of organized faith and replacing that with personal faith would do it. It's the institutions that make it difficult not the individual communication.

That’s bold of you to say after you called someone else’s deity a dirty cheater.

Is it relevant to my argument?

It is, because in a conversation between two theists, you a theist brought a lot of intensity and insulted a religion - in other words, it wasn’t “chill.”

Well my argument here was chill until you , an agnostic, came and try to do gotcha moment as I said before.

Should we up the temperature a bit to prove my point?

Maybe the idea that we are all potentially trying to appreciate truth, and that what we have is only 1 perspective on truth; and thereby the best way for us to understand truth or God is to understand the various perspectives of it. It’s one of the reasons that I find this reddit page so educational. It’s remarkable the different insights to be gained from these different perspectives. Also I think it’s a humbling experience when one realises that maybe there is no definitive perspective that is more right than any others.

I would suggest that anybody wishing to do interfaith to take some kind of very practical psychology course on the fine art of listening.

I think one of the most...uncomfortable/difficult things I see happen again and again is that there are some religions which have dogma/theological beliefs that make statements about different religions. This one is the hardest to deal with because it may very well be the belief of religion x that religion y is [characteristic or opinion Z] but...religion y may strongly disagree.

And how do you have an interfaith dialogue beyond someone else defining facts about your own religion through the lens of their theology? I would encourage people to reexamine the theological teachings that extend to defining religions that aren't your own. It's too easy to focus on defining other people's religions for them.

Why do you care what someone else is doing religiously?

You're not going to change their mind. If you can change it. It must not of been too much a part of them to begin with.

I can only figure you're looking for a change.

Or maybe get behind something that really brings a positive result in your mind.

Maybe you see no point to having the Bible read to you each Sunday. Seeing how you can read it yourself, any time.
