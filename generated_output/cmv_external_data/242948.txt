There's actually a lot evidence for a higher power/higher powers and an afterlife/afterlives

This post relates to existentialism because ideas of a higher power/higher powers and an afterlife/afterlives are often used to counter the idea the world is essentially absurd or meaningless apart from the meaning we arbitrarily ascribe to it.

I think anyone looking at the facts plainly will admit there is conflicting evidence as to the nature of a higher power and an afterlife, if such things exist. I also think anyone looking at the facts plainly will admit that anything that can be attributed to the existence of an afterlife or a god has alternative explanations.

All that said, many, many, many people throughout history testify to having convincing personal experiences of interacting with a higher power or having access to knowledge of an afterlife.

Furthermore, it is in fact logical to conclude humans are incapable of fully comprehending most of our reality, so just the fact that it is thus far impossible to model or conceive of a scientifically supportable way for consciousness to persist beyond death does not mean consciousness does not persist beyond death. A caterpillar has no way of knowing it will become a butterfly, but it does all the same. A dog has no way of knowing it was the product of selective breeding from wolves, etc. etc.

Just as a pet hamster can never understand the myriad forces that lead it from a pet shop to a child's bedroom, perhaps we similarly cannot comprehend the god or gods involved in our lives.

It is, in fact, a faith-based proposition to assume humans are capable of creating a model that completely explains reality. If humans are like every other species we observe, then we must have limits we cannot surpass, no matter what, and we must be subject to forces, very probably including higher intelligences, that we can never understand.

So, we KNOW we can't understand everything that affects us. And we KNOW that, if we are like every other observable life form, we are being influenced by HIGHER INTELLIGENCES. If there really is no higher intelligence beyond human intelligence in the universe, than humans are so exceptional that there probably IS a some sort of god responsible.

Combine the near certainty that we are influenced by higher intelligences with the extensive, albeit conflicting, reports of interactions with what appear to be higher powers, and the existence of AT LEAST one such being seems incredibly likely, if, of course, not at all certain.

If you want to take comfort in a godless and absurd universe and the end of consciousness after death, do so. But, similarly, if you want to take comfort in the idea of a greater purpose and an afterlife and a god or gods, do so as well because, MOST LIKELY (although it's impossible to say what the exact odds are) there IS something like a god and there IS something like an afterlife out there (the existence of the god-like being is more likely than the existence of an afterlife).

This does not mean you should abandon reason or critical thinking. Seeing reality for what it is doesn't mean making shit up to fill in what you don't know. For example, a preponderance of evidence indicates atheists can live long and happy lives, and there is certainly nob particularly convincing evidence they inevitably experience eternal punishment in the afterlife (if there is such a thing) either.

Whatever you do, be open to the truth of reality and do not let your own assumptions override this truth. Try to recognize what you do not or cannot know with certainty, if at all.

Also, if you haven't actually had one of these seeming encounters with a higher power, don't be too quick to dismiss the experiences of those who have. I think a key aspect of these encounters are how convincing they are. It's possible to have the convincing experience without being sure of what you experienced. But if you've never found any "encounter" to be convincing, I would argue you've never actually had an encounter, not that you're just smarter or more of a critical thinker than the people who have.

The real test for the skeptic is being confronted with something that is TRULY convincing and still retaining their pre-existing views, which is definitely possible.

What we know for certain is this life is too short to waste worrying much. Please, whatever your beliefs, interpret this post in such a way as to reduce your anxiety and bring you more joy. :) Share

Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. I see none here. You could use this argument to make the case that witches and demons run the world. If you’ve never encountered any, well, keep your mind open, and don’t worry about it!

Here would be my TLDRS:

it's a faith-based proposition to assume humans are unlike all the other lifeforms we observe that are both unable to comprehend most of their reality and subject to the power of greater intelligences.

In a reality in which we are influenced by forces we can never comprehend, mystical experiences should not be dismissed as irrelevant or not reflective of reality simply because we do not have a good model for understanding them.

If an understanding of the universe, informed by personal or others mystical experiences, serves your greater happiness and comports with observable, testable reality, it's fine to embrace it.

I'm not really making an extraordinary claim, since I'm not endorsing any specific conception of a higher intelligence or intelligences or an afterlife. And I don't even claim an afterlife exists.

If you were a blue whale, you’d look around and conclude “logically” that there must be larger animals somewhere in the ocean, merely because all other life forms are “subject to the power of greater body sizes.” But that would be wrong. In reality you just happen to be a member of a superlative class. It happens.

Mystical experiences are virtually always subjective, so untestable. One vision of a weeping Virgin Mary you once saw on the other side of a meadow may have relevance to your reality, but not to anyone else’s. So why should we deem it relevant or interesting, beyond revealing the quirks and flaws of human senses and easily suggestible cultural programming?

If you were a blue whale, you would be wrong, but you would be wrong not because you were likely to be wrong.

As for your second question, I don't feel like answering it because there is no quick answer, but I hear you. You've definitely helped me appreciate the weaknesses in the assumptions I made to support my arguments, and I'm grateful for that. Thank you. :)

Can "what in not known" be substituted for the word mystical?

"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence."

That phrase again? When will anybody who says that realise that what is extraordinary is subjective? You also don't necessarily require evidence that is extraordinary. Just evidence will often do.

It's a phrase that isn't logically coherent.

It’s a rule of thumb for people who want to introduce new ideas into the culture and have them survive for more than ten minutes. Not some logical axiom.

Well, what a misuse by you then.

You are the evidence.

Well good, because I am a witch.

GroundbreakingRow829

You can be anything you want, darling.

This is the most difficult concept to grasp, mainly because it is so unbelievably simple and obvious. Minds overlook this fact, and instead focus on the contents of the mind. Ideas like science, physical places and worlds, people, concepts…these are contained within the awareness. None of these things exist outside of the awareness of them.

People overlook the only directly knowable fact—that they are aware—and instead latch onto things and appearances within the awareness as truth. Belief in some kind of objective material world governed by certain physical laws is the true leap of faith.

I’m sure people wanted extraordinary evidence the world was round and not flat. That the sun was the center of the solar system and not the Earth. That atoms and even smaller particles existed. Ect, ect, ect.

Nonsense. No evidence. Ever. Anywhere. Logic says don’t attribute something you can’t explain to something you can’t see or touch or anything. Mystery implies itself and has no intrinsic or inherent solution.

The big bang is as incomprehensible as god. No true beginning no true end; reality had to of existed before the big bang regardless of our current state of reality; even if that reality was bleak and full of nothing. If it was bleak and full of nothing that hints to there being a catalyst that caused the big bang. If the big bang came out of nowhere that follows quantum’s slit experiment that it must be viewed perceptually by something for all the particles in our existence to act with structure as they have. There’s a higher probability of all this happening by plan than there is it happening by random according to even our own reality. There is as much evidence for a god causing the big bang as there is not. We do not know the catalyst, and if there was no catalyst then why is existence so structured?

Leather_Sprinkles513

Well said. First line was great.

Think about the Boltzmann Brain. There’s a much higher chance of there being one creator and billions of subjects. than no creator and billions of subjects.

The chance of there being a God is infinitely more likely than everything just appearing or “always existing”.

I don't know if it's infinitely more likely, but an intelligence being behind a lot of our reality seems very plausible considering that most creatures on Earth are literally subject to humans' intelligence with no knowledge or comprehension of this fact.

Leather_Sprinkles513

‘Always existed’ is a scientists way of saying ‘It’s beyond our comprehension’ with religious people. It’s basically a 50/50 split at this point. No one really knows anything. We are in such early stages of all this.. can’t imagine what information we are going to have in 100 or 1000 years.

Would someone just invent a Time Machine already and go back to see if Jesus was actually resurrected. Problem solved.

A higher degree of zero is still a zero?

You don't apply god to the equation because there is no way to test for that so its pointless in a scientific experiment.

You don’t add god to consideration because there is no basis for it. If there are explanations that happen without god, why bring one into it? A god that can’t be recorded in any tangible way, how would you even bring that into consideration.

Science deals with evidence and you build theories from what can be observed, a god doesn’t fit into that. Because then which god? There have been thousands.

Logic says don’t attribute something you can’t explain to something you can’t see or touch or anything.

That's actually empiricism, not logic.

Logic on its own says nothing. An argument can be perfectly logical on the basis of absurd premises.

However empiricism too has its shortcomings.

First, science has now come a long way to show that perception via the senses is not only limited in terms of capability (quantity of data) but also ability (quality of data). Meaning that unless we expand on our ability to perceive things (like a 6th sense or tetrachromacy for vision), there are things about physical reality that we will never be able to observe and yet might still influence it in a way that is significant to us.

Second, our senses alone only tell us what is happening in the moment and therefore need further cognitive tools to place the data into context. Sure, to that effect, empiricism employs rational thinking. But that cognitive function is limited in its capability, is slow, and energetically costly. And although computers give it a significant boost the problem remains the same as with senses: Limited ability. Computers can only boost what our rational mind can do in terms of capability, not ability. For this, you need creativity, intuition. Which is here used, but only in a very restrictive way that limits its possibilities.

However, even scientists agree that intuition can be very powerful. What many of them don't understand though, is that it is actually intuition that enables us to expand one's abilities with which to expand our "vision" to new realms of reality.

This is the side of (dogma-)free spirituality that often remains "unseen" by the scientific community. Which is really a shame, as expanding our ability to perceive reality—and therefore our self-consciousness—is what life through evolution has always been doing (for it is actually the key factor for survival on the long run).

Like, can't you see, with more than your eyes, what is happening today? We are running straigth into the wall because of our stubborness to stick to just empiricism and rationalism (because of past trauma dealing with spirituality as mediated by a corrupt and decadent church), from which derives (material) consumerism—the doom to us all if we do not change course now.

P.S.: I would have liked to mention here the fourth cognitive function, feeling, which currently is even more socially repressed than intuition. However, it would have made that comment way too long. Still, all our cognitive functions are important and worth using alongside the others. We evolved them to be used as such. Not doing so would make our way of functioning inefficient and therefore problematic.

Classic philosophy is not designed to answer questions. It is only capable of asking them, as infinitum. The evidence is right here on this thread. Now asking is always fine of course. But, if you want answers , don’t look to philosophical sources. I tried …

GroundbreakingRow829

Whilst I generally agree with you, I also think that philosophy can get one closer to truth (I'm here, for example, thinking of existentialism and phenomenology). Though it can only get them so far, due to it restricting intuition similarly to how science does it.

We, humans, are for the most part and at our very core irrational beings whose senses are abilitatively limited. Rationalism and empiricism are useful up to a certain point, but once one faces the irrational abyss of their own being, it is really intuition that guides them as they make a leap of faith into that darkness within.

How useful is intuition at either answering deep questions or asking them? My intuitions are an operational and functional ally and hardly ever an analytical or technical one.

That doesn't sound like logic. Just a subjective preference. Plenty of people do not follow that principle. It sounds as if the only thing nonsensical is your understanding of logic.

There is no evidence of any kind

Delusional experience is not evidence of anything.

If you want to believe in nonsense because you're scared of death, that's on you, but don't pretend you have "evidence", it's dishonest and rather pathetic.

I have no opinion either way, but people don’t just have religion because they’re “scared of death”. There’s many humans that need it for survival.

There’s many humans that need it for survival.

In what possible way?

Is there any religion out there that is not entirely focused on death and what's "beyond"

Will you live. Hope. I’d argue that is a necessity for a conscious human to survive.

Think about man’s struggle for much of history. Harsh conditions, brutal rulers, plagues… there are things much worse than we want to imagine. Why continue suffering unless you have something more to believe in? It’s hope, comfort, and will to live for those that need it.

I’m not a Christian, but I was indoctrinated with the Bible when young. It’s not entirely about death.

mystical experiences should not be dismissed

extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. In this case there is no evidence at all. None.

This personal experience nonsense is not evidence of anything other than that person's mental state.

Should we give equal credence to every type of hallucination and delusion, or just the special ones you choose? It's the literal opposite of evidence.

I think more than anything, you use "evidence" too lightly. Some serious evidence if I can weeb out would be like in Berserk when Griffith gave humanity all the same dream that prophesized his coming. Then he showed up and performed miracles under the guise of being a savior when he was actually in fact evil. This is why ultimately I'd make the argument not only is there no credible evidence of there being higher powers, you better hope there are none because now we can then entertain lovecraftian horrors entering the fray.

Not really... It's an assumption, not an assertion. We assume it because we see no evidence to the contrary. We don't have faith in it, there is no belief at play- it's just the best guess as per the available information we have. We are completely open to the fact that this may not actually be the case, and should new evidence arise to the contrary, we can update those assumptions.

In a reality in which we are influenced by forces we can never comprehend,

That is you making an ASSERTION that there is no evidence for.

mystical experiences should not be dismissed as irrelevant or not reflective of reality simply because we do not have a good model for understanding them.

We do have a certain amount of understanding of MANY of them. Sightings of "ghosts" are heavily linked with elevated CO levels and certain low-frequency noises. We are slowly growing to understand how many mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia and other disorders that cause delusions, work. We have been able to see that certain neurotransmitters rapidly change in level upon death, which could easily account for "mythical" near-death experiences- as well as why that experience is typically similar to whatever religion(s) the person is most familiar with or most believes in.

If an understanding of the universe, informed by personal or others mystical experiences, serves your greater happiness and comports with observable, testable reality, it's fine to embrace it.

That's called a coping mechanism. Everyone has them. However, you must recognize that there is no evidence to those beliefs that you personally choose to hold.

The way you think is what led to me becoming a deist. I’ve been so disillusioned with organized religion (like for example the absurd notion that somebody burns for ETERNITY for not worshipping the invisible sky daddy with no evidence of his existence) that it sort of pushed me into being a strict atheist. But I like the idea of there being a God and us having a purpose. I think I actually do believe it. You can read my post about my beliefs here (I explain more in the comments) and let me know what you think about it if you want. My deist beliefs are perfectly compatible with modern science

Sounds to me like “Gods aren’t disproven so they might be real”. I mean yeah, but so could unicorns and leprechauns. Where’s the actual evidence? Cause “personal experience” is the weakest possible form, people have had “personal experiences” with magical dragons and mystical fairies plenty of times.

The anecdotal evidence for unicorns and leprechauns is weaker than the anecdotal evidence for some kind of higher power.

Ultimately, there are different existential philosophies out there, some more compatible with spirituality than others. I would recommend reading Kierkegaard’s work, as he certainly wasn’t secular.

As for my personal perspective, I am more agnostic. If there is a “higher power,” they clearly seem to be indifferent, so I am also going to remain indifferent. When they have the time to respond, I will change my perspective. But until that time comes, it looks like I’m stuck finding my own path.

From a cosmic perspective, the universe also seems to be quite indifferent. Therefore, the only logical conclusion that I can reasonably make is that I am left to find my own meaning and purpose. So I actively involve myself within my community and maintain healthy relationships with family and friends, while pursuing a wide range of hobbies and interests.

I so agree with you.

Absolutely. I generally share your perspective on this matter.

The concern is with dogma itself (religious or otherwise). On both sides of the aisle, there appears to be a rigidity of belief that can have extremely harmful consequences. Whether it is secular determinism, religious extremism, or other extreme "-isms." The challenge is that we can end up excusing absolutely horrible behaviors on account of beliefs. We can defer responsibility for our own actions, or find some sort of justification or scapegoat, while also refraining from ever critically thinking or questioning such beliefs. Therefore, there is a fine line with adopting any form of belief. We must remain vigilant on how the beliefs that we hold might potentially be harmful, disempowering, or have significant consequences.

Having mystical experiences doesn't really tell you anything. Humans have a very vivid imagination. We can enter altered states of consciousness through a number of means, be it psychoactive substances, mental or neurological alterations, brain damage/tumors, sleep deprivation, light deprivation, starvation, dream like states, meditation and a myriad of other causes. There is a reason why shamans and priests and prophets often starve themselves or live hermetic lives or use psychoactive plants. Then you have the numerous reason as to why a person might be exaggerating or fabricating claims of mystical experiences, so second hand accounts are mostly useless for anything that can't be properly tested.

The only evidence I see for a higher power/god is that it’s hard to understand how something can come from nothing. What caused the Big Bang? Maybe there was never nothing? Idk. But that’s all the evidence I have for it. Nothing else this reality has showed me makes me believe in some higher power. I think the question how can something come from nothing is a legitimate red flag though if you are a full on atheist which is why I won’t ever identify as one. Agnostic here.

As for an afterlife, I see very very little evidence of one when that involves us keeping our individuality/self/memories/personality. It just doesn’t make any sense given what we have observed about the human brain. There are people who are born with abnormal brains like psychopaths. How can someone even have a fair chance at life to develop into some decent person when they are literally born with an impaired brain which will affect their decision making, ability to empathize with others, etc? It doesn’t make sense the deeper you go. Mental illness like schizophrenia? Another example of a person having no shot at developing normally with a fair chance. How about a person with Down syndrome? They will have a completely different life experience from most others. A person suffers a traumatic brain injury? That person might be in a vegetative state for the rest of life.

So the point is, we have so much evidence that our brains are what make us, us. Our brain is our personality, it is our individual self, it is what drives our decisions. When the brain dies what would be left of you or I? Therefore I’m 99% certain there is no afterlife.

The only evidence you have for a brain objectively existing is contained within your awareness. You cannot find a brain existing somewhere unless you are aware of. Go ahead and try to find a brain somewhere. It must first appear within your awareness, and then that same awareness contrives all sorts of ideas and facts about this brain.

One’s direct experience is that awareness happens first, then the whole of the physical world appears within that awareness. The model most believe—that the physical world is objectively real and that our awareness appears within that world—is just a belief, a faith. Your direct experience is that YOU (awareness) are primary and real, and that everything else is contingent on that.

Are you saying that other lifeforms cannot comprehend the power of a greater intelligence with humans being the greater intelligence? I mean, my cat can see me, feel me pet him, etc. It would be one thing for God to not explain to me what He is doing, it would be another thing for me not to detect Him at all. Your argument would make sense if we could detect God in some way but God, for example, allowed WW2 to happen and we couldn’t understand why because of our lack of intelligence in comparison to Him.

Sure, but there are many mystical experiences in which nothing is happening at all. I suffered from sleep paralysis for a year with an intense training program and stressful lifestyle. My brain was able to hallucinate and see people coming into my house, room, walking around, speaking to me, etc. Religious people say these are demons, rationalists say they are just hallucinations from when the body cannot fully relax for sleep. It’s almost entirely certainly the latter.

And what if it’s in the opposite direction. For example, I think demons have possessed me because of my experiences and God is sending me to Hell. Am I allowed to believe my experiences that way or just in a positive way?

No there isn’t, anecdotes aren’t evidence, but there are plenty of religious existentialists if you really need to incorporate that into your life.

So, you've never heard of the term "anecdotal evidence?" Scientists do consider anecdotes, although they are considered to be the least form of evidence.

“Scientists” do? What kind of scientists? Do you mean psychologists or something? I am a published scientist and never in my career has an anecdote made it into a paper I’ve read or worked on.

I literally never said that anecdotal evidence makes it into a paper. I said it is taken notice of and is considered a form of evidence (albeit the lowest form of it). That's it.

The evidence for this being true is so difficult to see because WE are the evidence. It’s like looking all over for your glasses that you just happen to be wearing. And then when you finally remember, it ends up being such an “oh yeah!!!!” moment.

Existence is synonymous with a boundless, immaterial intelligence that seems to identify with the temporary collection of objects within its mind. I’m convinced that what we call “death” is simply the dissolution of the finite forms back into a boundless formlessness.

As a child I always thought it was very odd that I happen to exist “right now”. Like, what are the odds that an infinite amount of time exists and I just happen to exist at this “now”. I’ve come to understand that it is always “now” and that I—the true I that is aware of apparent objects and concepts and places and people—always exists. It’s the things like the world, places, people, bodies, and minds that are temporary and unreal.

Within the contextual, temporary state we find ourselves in, I agree with all three of your points. However, I find that even our bodies, minds, and entire physical world we exist in is contingent and not primary.

If one looks to find truth directly, there is only one truth: you are awareness. Your awareness precedes everything you can think of, because even the mind is a contingent property of this awareness.

We tend to give names to this awareness…God, divine, universe, the all…but the names are just labels attached to this singular truth. We believe or reject the afterlife—within awareness. We study science and the material world—within awareness. We wake and sleep and eat and dream—within awareness. The whole of reality is contained within a simple truth: you are aware. Every other concept, every other thought, every person and every place, arises from that simple fact.

I remember hearing that Deepak Chopra had offered the Amazing Randi to prove once and for all that reality doesn't exist completely in the mind. I guess it is one of those brain teaser questions you could fiddle with indefinitely and you always have "but how do you really know?" as an out.

That may be so but it's not the same thing as irrefutable evidence of the divine. I'm not sure what would entail exactly, though I've seen it done in movies and read about it in books, fiction or personal accounts.

If an understanding of the universe, informed by personal or others mystical experiences, serves your greater happiness and comports with observable, testable reality, it's fine to embrace it.

Mystical experiences shouldn't be dismissed offhand, we all crave that kind of connection. Those experiences are meaningful whether they are "real" or not. But I do worry about people who have experiences that seem "real" that are actually hallucinations. These are common among heavy meditation people. Hopefully they have a good teacher who can explain this and get them to understand it was just their mind playing tricks on them. Because the people who decide, well I'm getting it straight from the source and don't need human teachers anymore, are the kind of people who eventually get to the point of having followers who commit atrocities.

I agree with you. I didn't meant to endorse all mystical experiences or anecdotes as "real" or reflective of a genuinely divine force.

While I want to believe there is a higher power, I have not seen any hard evidence there is. Many people believe in a higher power just like our early ancestors. If one reads and studies mythologies and the "gods" that humans have worshiped many higher powers. They are all quite similar. Yet there is little evidence of one (a higher power) actually exists. Like aliens and flying saucers, I want to believe there is some evidence by the sheer numbers of people who claim to have seen them, I see no real hard evidence they are or were there. I don't need to physically put my hand on one I just want to see some evidence somewhere that something is out there that can give me hope that this isn't all there is. Point me in a direction I will read, research and find out for myself. Or convince me. I am not an agnostic, and I am not an atheist and I do not believe in a higher power that is being preached and worshiped today. If h=this is the true higher power than I want nothing to do with it as millions of children go to bed hungry every night, I see a battered wife and child no less than twice a month where is the supreme power there? I see a person pit hundreds of dollars into a temple or church's coffers, they are blessed yet Friday night they go get drunk, find carnal satisfaction then go home to "the little lady and their child". I could go on and on, but why please help me believe as of right now I just can't.

Ultimately, I think you have to "find" the truths of these things experientially by their very nature in a way.

I think my TLDRS are: 1. it's a faith-based proposition to assume humans are unlike all the other lifeforms we observe that are both unable to comprehend most of their reality and subject to the power of greater intelligences.

2. In a reality in which we are influenced by forces we can never comprehend, mystical experiences should not be dismissed as irrelevant or not reflective of reality simply because we do not have a good model for understanding them.

3. If an understanding of the universe, informed by personal or others mystical experiences, serves your greater happiness and comports with observable, testable reality, it's fine to embrace it.

Somehow I’ve found solace in my ancestors beliefs. As earth people we must do everything within my power to maintain the balance between Mother Earth and man.

That. Was a worthy read. Bravo!

As a person that has seen manifestation in the presence of others, and has verified such using the scientific method. I can add that “Seeing is mother fucking believing”. The biggest problem most people have with this subject is not having “been there” personally. Therefore it is all hearsay and dismissive nonsense.

Just like explaining a microwave to a cave man, it just sounds stupid to them. Yet I “do” have “a magic box”that cooks food without heat or flame. Said cave man can hoot and throw poop all he wants. It doesn’t change facts and reality.

Humanity is currently a strange mix of Higher order thinkers, and Cave people. It is just that the Cave people look like everyone else!

I don't think of other people as "cave people," but I appreciate you got something out of my post. :)
