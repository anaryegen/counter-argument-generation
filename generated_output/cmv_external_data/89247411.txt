How many actual instances of “self-defense by guns” occur in US?

A common argument for the right to own guns is that guns help you “protect your self, property, and family”.

I wonder how many instances of a civilian who is not normally involved in crime actually having to defend himself and his property with guns occur in US.

Is there a stats for that?

It’s very difficult to say. The majority go uncounted. I’ve had to draw a firearm twice in my life against bears. Things like that don’t get reported anywhere.

I have to do this to a rabid animal. Outside of calling a game warden there is probably nothing else to that

There's also probably a lot of situations where a intruder sees an armed home owner and flees before any engagement occurs, or where someone fires at an intruder but doesn't call it in, etc.

It's just really difficult to pin down.

I've had 2 different coworkers who've shot bears in self-defense. I know they reported to Fish & Game but that wouldn't figure into crime statistics, so that might be missed in some 'defensive gun use' statistics.

No, presumably this bear was a threat

Fucking murder right here

This bear didn't trade the #32 pick for Chase Claypool

Yinz can have him back, plus our second round pick in 2024.

......did I use "yinz" correctly?

As a bears fan, I hate how right you are

Bear bears or bare bears?

Bare armed bears bear arms.

When they're in your front yard super bowl shuffling at 2 in the morning what options do you really have?

Exactly, no crime even took place

It was still self-defense...

Agreed, but not likely trackable through police reports

On the contrary, I'm an expert in bear law.

Alaska, this checks out.

Totally anecdotal but I am one of those people. And all I did was show it on my hip.

I imagine the majority of defensive gun uses are exactly that. “I have a gun, walk away.”

Several years back, FSU did a study that showed there are over 2 million self defense incidents a year where it only took brandishing a firearm to resolve the issue and those incidents go unreported because nothing really "happened."

And there's not a registry or anything that someone has to submit to, like filing a police report or incident report to insurance or anything remotely close to that. It's just 2 people having a confrontation, stopped by one person being armed.

Additionally, giving that brandishing a firearm (without due cause) is itself a crime in a lot of states, there's a perverse incentive to not report such incidents. What can the cops do to help you? Nothing. But if you go to the cops and say, "I showed my gun to this guy and he ran away," you might catch a charge yourself. Nope, better to follow the ESA official unofficial guidelines: shoot, shovel, shut up.

It's worth noting that the reason there's no registry, and few if any people conducting real research about this, is because until a couple years ago, it was actually illegal for the CDC to study gun violence.

I feel like this nuance is missing from most conversations about gun culture, especially when talking to foreigners. There's this idea that everyone who owns a gun is out here firing them willy-nilly all the time. I reality most instances I can think of are exactly what you guys are describing in this thread. The few times I've felt the need to use a weapon, it was the same. Most people who are up to no good have no interest in learning whether the shotgun they just saw or heard is loaded or not. The threat alone is usually enough.

Can confirm; I've never needed to draw or even show when I was carrying; I desperately don't want to ever be in a situation where I would need to.

Knowing that if I HAD to defend myself, or someone else, I legally COULD gives me a definite sense of security, but a commensurately high sense of responsibility.

Its also worth noting that that study consisted of 5000 people of which 66 responded with using a gun defensively. That was then extrapolated to the entire population so the study and 2 million defensive uses is not a very reliable source to use.

Isn't brandishing itself a crime in many states?

Edit: thanks for the helpful clarifications, everyone.

Most written anti-brandishing laws require it to be brandished in a threatening way. Brandishing defensively is also protected under self defense common law.

more replies More replies

That would be saying “i have a gun” to get what you want. Saying “I have a gun” in a situation where you are being threatened is legal anywhere.

more reply More replies

"Brandishing" has a legal definition and there are laws for self-defense. It's not very likely that an aggressor who's shown a weapon by their potential victim is going to go running off to the police to report that they had a gun pointed at them.

No matter what the legal specifics may be, I think the assailant would have to the police and say, "I was going to rob this person, then they brandished a firearm! Arrest them!!"

This seems like it wouldn't work, so the legality of brandishing to chase off an assailant is moot.

Not when done in self defense.

Brandishing is a very specific thing

more reply More replies

Not if you are in danger. Then its part of self defense.

Going around waving it at people is a crime

Drawing it on someone trying to Hurt you is not

I asked the officer, when I got my carry permit, because even showing it or allowing it to be seen other than accidentally due to clothing movement or incidental to moving the holster is illegal in my state. The question I asked, and I knew how silly it sounded, was, "What if I am legitimately threatened and I have to draw my pistol to defend myself but, when I do, the threat decides to run away. Can I get in trouble for brandishing since I didn't shoot?"

Officer said, "Don't pull your gun and give orders. Don't threaten anyone. But you'll never get in trouble for not shooting."

Like an old freind of mine liked to quote "God created Man, but Colt made them equal"

It's what they tell us at CCW classes.

"you probably won't ever have to draw. Simply acting like you have a gun ends nearly all encounters. But you still need it if they don't believe you or don't value their life." -Something like that from a guy who's been in way more fun fights than me

Which becomes kind of an issue because it’s hard to parse out times someone felt like their having a gun was pivotal vs when it was actually a difference-making deterrent; shootings and murders are inherently more concrete stats.

And of course there has also been a push legislatively to avoid collecting federal gun data, because a lot of people don’t want to know what the data says, which is not helpful.

I have used a firearm to protect myself and my pets from a wild boar that charged us. People use them to defend against other animals as well, but I think a lot of people view self defense through a narrow lens that only includes defense against human criminals.

Fair point. I'm a non-gun owner but the one time i've wanted a weapon was when i was on a bike ride in the middle of nowhere and an aggressive dog came at me. All i could do was keep maneuvering my bike between me and him for 10 minutes until he gave up and left. Pretty scary and i carry pepper spray on my road bike now.

Yeah I've done it once cause some unhinged lady followed me home all the way from publix over a perceived traffic slight in the parking lot (which I was actually in the right for). She started screaming at me in front of my house and I'll I had to do was pull out the shottie and she drove away. She had out-of-state plates and if she's crazy enough to follow me home over me swerving around her after she pulled out in front of me without looking, in the state of FLORIDA of all places, who knows what she's gonna do.

Yep, had this happen twice in my life so far

Yep. Been carrying for 8 years. I've showed it twice and both times the situation was done right there.

It’s impossible to know for sure. Many are unreported.

And in the other direction many are illusory. One report on stand your ground laws had a list of cases that weren't even brought to court due to the threat of that defense included murders in retaliation for delivering mail to a house, using a driveway to turn around, and throwing popcorn at someone talking in a theater. The main interview was someone who was shot through a door because he knocked and announced himself as maintenance for a while.

Do you have a link handy? Most of those wouldn't be covered by stand your ground

I think this episode https://revealnews.org/podcast/no-retreat-the-dangers-of-stand-your-ground-update-2023/

According to the CDC it happens between 500,000 and 3,000,000 times a year.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/paulhsieh/2018/04/30/that-time-the-cdc-asked-about-defensive-gun-uses/

So for every homicide there's at least 19.21 defensive gun uses.

That homicide number probably includes accidental shootings or suicide though.

It does, and furthermore there are almost twice as many suicides as homicides in the US each year.

Yes, but just for the record, accidental gun deaths are vanishingly rare in the US, relative to the vast number of households with guns in them. We have a total of about 500 accidental gun deaths per year, out of a population of 330 million, in which almost half of households are willing to admit to poll takers that they have guns.

Certainly I'd prefer that number be zero, but in such a large and heavily armed population, it's damned low. A person killed with his own gun is almost definitely doing it deliberately.

And those are only the ones that are reported. Lots of people won't bother to report that "I showed my gun and he ran away."

The CDC data isn’t of reported cases. It’s a poll asking people if/how many times they have used a gun defensively.

True - but we estimate violent crime the same way - the NCVS.

I might be thinking of the FBI Uniform Crime Statistics...

And there are going to be TONS of interactions where two people wave guns at each other and both think they used it defensively.

I've done it twice. I've never reported anything.

And note that killing in self defense is also "homicide" (which just means the killing of a person, whether or not justified), so the homicide numbers include fatal defensive gun uses.

This suggests not only that guns are far, far more likely to be used in self defense than to murder, but also that in the vast majority of cases, victims who defend themselves with guns don't even have to kill the attacker.

And how many of those homicide are in self defense? Probably a lot

The CDC was pressured by anti-gun groups to remove that stat from their website.

Sir_Sir_ExcuseMe_Sir

Even Brady and other anti-gun groups were admitting to well over 100,000 DGUs per year though. Not sure if that's still on their websites

My favorite Brady kerfuffle was when they, apropos of nothing, posted something to the effect that women shouldn't shoot rapists because killing someone was worse than getting raped. I thought it was some 4chan troll at first but, apparently, it was real.

well, as we all know, in a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try and shut the whole thing down.

edited to add, just in case it's needed: /s
