Social networking does not consider the invasion of personal privacy as a positive effect. Positive aspects include documenting memories, learning, self-advertising, and friendship forming, while negative ones range from privacy invasion to cyberbullying.

Social networking includes many positive effects but also comes with certain negative consequences. Positive effects of social networking include the ability to document memories, learn about various topics, self-advertise, and form friendships. However, not all outcomes are beneficial. For instance, social networking does not include the invasion of personal privacy as a positive effect. Negative impacts of social networking can range from invading personal privacy, leading to information overload, fostering isolation, impacting self-esteem, and can even result in online harassment and cyberbullying. These adverse effects highlight the need for users to engage with social media conscientiously and critically, acknowledging both its advantages and potential pitfalls.
