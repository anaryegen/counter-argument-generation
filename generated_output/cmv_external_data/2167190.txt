How do communist account for human greed?

Just curious to see how one of you would account for something that is inevitable with all humans, greed.

How would you get people on board with doing jobs they would not want to do e.g. trash person or someone who works in the sewers; would jobs go in rotation?

Edit: bonus, bonus question, how would the community innovate, what would be the motivation of innovation? Share

Communist theory typically revolves around common ownership and distribution of property. The idea being, that if everyone owns everything, nobody does.

Everyone has equal right to take property from their local communal pool, but should be expected to justify it- for example, they want wood to build a cool treehouse for their kids, or insulin to take care of their diabetes. On a macro scale this would require specific administration and organisation, but the form that that organisation would take is up for debate- democratic workplace practices should be the norm here.

The point is that human greed can be accounted for, since everyone has the right to communally say 'no' to those that take more than justifiably their fair share.

With regards to jobs, perhaps the person removing trash or cleaning sewers would be given special privileges with regards to material goods- a union of representatives of some sort could negotiate working conditions and resource allocation. For those working the least popular and highest skilled jobs, for example, could be granted nicer houses, more rare food, better transport and more access to useless luxuries such as jewelry.

Obviously this is all theoretical, and there are many ways such a society could form. This is not necessarily an ideal society, but merely better than the current system that contains excessive overwork, inequality and pollution.

And what's to stop someone from saying no to their neighbors because they don't like them?

Everyone else, saying no to their saying no. It's not a veto, it requires community consensus.

True, but what else do we have? Rule of the rich?

Well that's true in any democracy, but what convincing argument would prevent people from providing someone with food or necessary medicine? What prevents that person from moving? Surely we can achieve a basic agreement that everyone is entitled to healthcare and food, and move on from there?

How would it be decided what's a fair share?

the "dear leader"decides every1 is equally poor(except of the government agents).the regime back then took my grandfather's land and my family became poor as hell after that.

there is no way for a fair share to happen.some people will get to lose stuff even though they may have acquired that stuff in a lawful way in the first place.

Community consensus, reasonability, special needs, difficulty of work, etc

Sounds awfully subjective

How would you objectively decide it? Allow the market to allocate billions to one person?

See this is why it would NEVER work. I’m sorry ive really tried to see this with an open mind. It’s just human nature. If I work my ass off for something that’s mine. I would love to share but on my terms.

Imagine a guy saves saves saves for a Harley. Saves saves saves to get cool parts etc. then the neighbor can just say “I want that Harley this weekend.” He can just take it? Cmon. Or “Hey I like your beach house passed down generations in your family.” “I know you grew up on it and dream of raising your kids here but you have had it long enough. It’s my turn to have a beach house in my family so you get mine next to the dumps.”

It’s just not feasible guys. It’s irrational. It’s human nature, the powerful in a society like this will use that power too.

You can get a harley though. That's personal property, not private. You can say, this is mine, I want this for the work I do, and I want to keep it forever. And people can agree. Or, if there is only one harley (this is just an example, if there are plenty of motorbikes in the world, and there isn't too much demand, then allocating one to every person who really wants one isn't a massive leap) people can say, no, there is only one, and everyone wants a shot.

The beach house is a different thing- it's an abode, an area of land, and counts as private property. While I appreciate the sentimentality, it's kind of like saying 'my palace and vast estate has been passed down the family for millenia, why should it be shared with the stinking public'. If its in an unpopular area you might be able to get exclusive rights to it, but again, this is something you'll have to sort out locally, within the bounds of the new systems.

It’s just not feasible guys. It’s irrational. It’s human nature, the powerful in a society like this will use that power too.

The idea of mass democracy on this scale is to deny anyone that kind of power at all. The power of telecommunications and the internet makes this much easier to implement, and could allow us to revolutionize how society functions, have we the ovaries/balls to do it. Also, the 'it's human nature' fallacy is really old and has been debunked literally thousands of times.

I really appreciate your response and agree I guess to a point. But I just know human nature in a different way than you do I guess. I was a cop for many many years and know how humans work. Then to say that a house or property belonging to the family for generations you would need to sort it out with authorities. I just patiently disagree. Who would enforce that? What I I said no, this is my property GTFO?

I think the major issue is Upon implementation you would have massive riots. Massive conflicts. Certainly civil war to which the country would not recover for generations. Communism I think is just not feasible until the worlds resources are able to be immediately provided to all via AI or automation. Until that happens you will always have greed. But I do think greed to a point is a good thing.

I feel that working for the police might colour your perception of human nature somewhat, as all too often you act as the hand of often misguided justice, working with people conditioned to react to your presence with fear, suspicion and hostility. I have worked in healthcare for a number of years and am currently studying a medical degree, and have an entirely different view of human nature, and furthermore, that saving lives often requires redistribution of resources in ways that people find unpleasant.

Should a communist 'state' (an oxymoron I know) arise, its form will be unique- I cannot predict what shape its attitudes and policies will take with any claim to accuracy. It could aim to ensure that every individual undergoes the least disruption during the transition to a classless, moneyless society, with people retaining their own homes, vehicles and possessions in the vast majority of cases. It could aim to ensure that those with less are provided with security, healthcare, comfort, food and shelter at sufficient levels regardless of who suffers. Depending on the situation (famine, starvation, mass homelessness) either of these outcomes could be regarded as more moral.

For a communist state to arise, conflict and rioting are almost a guarantee anyway. It's known as revolution and counter-revolution. There's been a lot written about these subjects, more than I could explain here, so if interested, I advise that you read more about this, but I assure you, it has been recognized and accounted for in Marxist doctrine.

How the fuck does capitalism deal with it? Besides rewarding and encouraging it?

You can disagree with me here but greed isn’t natural in humans . We only think it’s natural because we live in a society that rewards greed . We would stop this by having public ownership of the Means of production

On the subject of shitty jobs we can always give lower hours and more time off higher pay (with the labour voucher system) Automation will take more shitty jobs as society progresses

On innovation, innovation happens when smart people get bored simple as that.

Comment deleted by user

All the great and famous investors before the last century were bored rich noblemen that had a great education growing up.

They had no great dilemma or reward to motivate them, they were just bored and wanted to impress their friends.

Ok, so before we really got the industrial revolution going there were only a few people who had the time. I can agree with that.

However, after about 1800 people were clearly working hard at innovation for commercial reasons in large quantities. The 19th century had tons of commercial labs, factories, railroads, shipyards etc. that innovated very quickly on engineering a lot of things and figuring out a lot of science.

For example the Waltham watch company innovated like crazy for commercial reasons. This is just one example of many many companies that did so.

In 1850, at Roxbury, Massachusetts, David Davis, Edward Howard, and Aaron Lufkin Dennison formed the company that would later become the Waltham Watch Company. Their revolutionary business plan was to manufacture the movement parts of watches so precisely that they would become fully interchangeable. Based upon the experience of earlier failed trials, Howard and Dennison eventually perfected and patented their precision watch making machines, creating what has been called the American System of Watch Manufacturing.

Most of the real work and innovation of building our modern world happened because people were competing in business.

Frankly you can go back even to guys like Isaac Newton who innovated a lot (and got paid for it) when it came to things like coinage.

And yes, universities certainly have had their place as well. The fundamental research has always been key to innovation, but turning this stuff into things people can use has always happened commercially.

I'm going to say you're wrong just based on greed showing up in every system throughout human history

Even animals have greed

Animals also shit whenever and wherever they feel like.

So do the homeless and half on india

I think what they're trying to say is that every system throughout history has rewarded or even required greed. If human nature is simply to adapt to the material conditions of our surroundings then if we create a system where greed is not needed or encouraged then we can live without it.

There would still be a drive for those who want to be in power and have more power, which is a form of greed.

Let's say that the most power one could possibly have would already be had by everyone. The means to gain any more power than that do not/cannot exist. Let's also say that you were born into this society when it was well established and capital/inequality are long forgotten relic of the past.

This is what I mean by creating a set of conditions where greed is not encouraged or required.

Greed exists because in evolution if people didn’t take what they needed they would die

Ok but no actual rebuttal, just a bunch of downvotes and a snarky reply. Literally everything that humans are is based on evolution and helps them survive. If you think that biology is not like that then I would like to hear it. Communists' 'materialism is societal' has literally no evidence whatsoever.

Read 'the selfish gene' by Richard Dawkins, an interesting read on evolution and how genes act in their own interest. It explains how human empathy, kindness, and generosity evolved from the selfish effects of genes promoting their own kind. Greed does exist, but so does kindness, and in greater quantity.

Not everything is evolution unless you’re using a super vague and personal definition of it. Most of our ethics and morals are developed culturally, not biologically.

And mountains of research in psychology, sociology, and anthropology are the evidence. That how we behave is deeply affected by our environment is pretty much universally accepted.

On top of that, survival doesn’t necessitate massive amounts of wealth. You’re basing your biological link on what you find to be an intuitive connection (feel free to post actual research to the contrary if you can find any), but even if we assume that your pseudo-scientific method is accurate it still does nothing to explain - let alone justify - the massive material gap between rich and poor that exists today.

Material Greed wouldnt do any lasting damage since it would be easy to spot and deal with, other types could be a problem but it depends alot on the circuntances.

Political power is very diluted in a communism society, since it is stateless and classless, in a Socialist Country whatever, that could lead to the corruption of the dictatorship of the proletariat, but that is beyond the scope since you are asking about communism only.

You might have a problem, whatever, with someone that wants to be really popular and ends up develops a cult of personality behind him, which i believe could be a form of greed. Imagine if this person is ill-intended or just crazy, spreading to his cult that vaccines cause autism and the water makes frogs gay. I would hope that this kind of thing would be illegal, but it doesnt mean it wouldnt happen and can be hard to identify.

How would you deal with greed if you say it is easy to deal with?

Well, the details will vary accourding to the specifics of the type of communism you subscribe to, but the political body responsible for your region will notice If someone is hoarding wealth, they investigate and prosecute that person. Someone similar to this happens even today, do some research on the danger of being a chinese millionaire.

It's mostly social conditioing. Greed is good if not necessary in capitalism.

The idea that greed is a natural character of all human beings is perhaps the greatest success in terms of indoctrination to this current day.

Our values are deeply shaped by the society around us. The virtue of altruism were greatly significant in the days of Confucianism. The virtue of empathy, to this day, is still encouraged because of christian, Islamic, and even Buddhist teachings.

Homosexuality was once seen as a psychological deviation, but now it is just a normality.

In a society where exploitation is rewarded with wealth, it is only natural that ambition and greed is being portrayed as some natural character.

Modern society has evolved in a sense to this split between righteous cause to help the people vs individual egoism. There is something that’s happening and it’ll take time to see what exactly is being changed on a societal level.

Liberal capitalism has trained us to believe we don't have a moral, ethical obligation to our community and wider humankind. Once you accept this, many of socialism's problems & challenges go away. But it's a big hurdle for many people, sadly, and their response is always the same: "Why should I?". The socialist asks: "What is to be done?" (I'm not particularly Leninist, but the spirit of the question is positive)

Greed: The question is, in a society where goods and luxuries are freely available and plentiful, and property (in the sense we think of it) doesn’t exist what form would greed take? Greed can be defined as the “intense and selfish desire” for a certain resource, therefore perhaps we should look at the nature of desire rather than greed.

Desire is intensely social. We desire what others desire and what is scarce. A change in what we desire in society (that would come from the changes mentioned above) away from luxury goods towards other things e.g. artistic, physical, scientific accomplishments, and of course the respect and acclaim of one’s community; would change greed.

Clearly today’s capitalism rewards and encourages the accumulation of certain things over and above one’s neighbour. It’s part and parcel of competition and consumerism. What are we told to want before we even realised we wanted it? How are we told to achieve success at a young age?

Greed in the new society would be for outstripping your neighbours in whatever arena of life you respect the most. Generally, this would benefit society and individuals alike (the aim for communism and anarchism). Accumulation for accumulation’s sake would be pathological and viewed accordingly, just as psychopathy is today. Social taboo is the oldest and arguably most powerful system for social regulation. Just think of the things in our society that are regulated through social mores, politeness, mockery, compliments, shunning etc, without recourse to legal jurisprudence. How do you want to be viewed by your friends, colleagues, neighbours? This is powerful force in all societies.

Greed would obviously coalesce around power. Power is always present in any social system. What form it would take in a stateless, classless, moneyless, propertyless, lawless society is a good question. I’m not sure, but in any social network there are nodes- hubs and junctions of thick connections. I think power would come from being a node in some form.

Most of the work against greed is done by the end of early childhood and is reinforced throughout life by social pressure, away from selfishness and towards those equally innate human qualities that promote social and individual excellence. This is done in our society, kindness, non-violence and sharing are promoted in childhood but without the social conditions to support those impulses they wilt and die- only growing in our personal lives, in the political and economic realms they are considered naive, childish and stupid.

The deeper philosophical issue here is what is innate to human nature? And the related question, to what extend does one’s social/environmental milieu create one’s character? I would argue that there are some limited biological impulses but that much more of human nature is socially constructed, even our biology is socially modulated. The point is, we should create a system where it is easier to be good.

My questions to you: Do you believe humans to be more innately good or bad? Do you agree that our social conditions shape our character to a profound degree?

To quickly answer your bonus questions: Shite work would be decreased by automation, shared between the population in voluntary but very encouraged work groups (maybe a day a month) and much work that is considered low skilled and low prestige (e.g. care work) would be professionalised and given prestige and humane conditions through being managed by those who do the work. Socially unnecessary jobs would no longer exist.

Innovation would be encouraged by given those people who have the desire to innovate the resources they require and the acclaim they deserve. Studies in behavioural economics have shown that complex creative problem solving is not motivated by money past a minimal level. I come from a scientific background and I can tell that no researcher I know is doing it for the money but they all spend a giant, wasteful percentage of their time applying for grants I.e. in an indirect way trying to explain to a profit based system why something that might not directly generate any profit immediately or ever is worth investigating and understanding. In other words, for most research capitalism gets in the way. For most academics and engineers I’d argue that the pleasure of solving the problem, understanding the question and creating something for the benefit of mankind is enough motivation.

In a propertyless post-scarcity automated society, much of the reason why we currently need capital investment to innovate disappears. Use the public labs, create the prototype on your 3D printer at home, post it online watch it spread, give it to your friends. In addition you no longer have to choose what is profitable over what is most beneficial to mankind so built in obsolesce ends. What is the point of profit when you already own everything and nothing? Without the walls of property the ideas that are the lifeblood of innovation are finally able to flow free.

human nature is a product of human culture and society, all of which are in a state of constant flux which can be, to a certain extent, steered through the processes of dialectal materialism. So at the right historical moment the right economic and cultural conditions will cause the right behaviour

greed is a consequence of fear of scarcity. Conquer scarcity conquer greed. Also conquer scarcity and greed stops being a problem anyway.

if not robots: you ever shared a flat? Who emptied the bins and unclogged the drains? Probably something like that.

also hierarchy of needs: once we've conquered scarcity all that remains in life will be a quest for meaning, and so doing useful work will actually be quite rare and prized

also who knows? We don't really have any idea what a communist society will look like, and it's fairly pointless to speculate. We'll know when we get there. It will probably have robots.

bonus bonus question:

like they do now and for the reasons they do now. The idea that profit drives innovation is nonsense. This is why most scientific progress in human history has occurred as a consequence of militaries, universities and monasteries - ie not for profit endeavours.

Greed is a result of capitalism. I tend to believe that humans are naturally good and if we were living in a less competitive society greed would be all but gone.

Bonus answer: people will do the shitty jobs like garbage man etc out of necessity, and ideally I would think the responsibilities would be split amongst the community. And hopefully with automation around the corner, most of these jobs won’t need humans working them.

Bonus bonus answer: ya know what I’m gonna go out pretty far on this one, so hold on tight. Capitalism stifles creativity and prevents innovation. This probably sounds counter intuitive because it seems like there’s a lot of incentive to innovate in the form of money. But look at how the coal industry get huge subsidies while clean energy can barely get off the ground (in the US at least). We are literally facing the destruction of our planet and capitalism is fighting against innovation as hard as it can because the people in power (ie the coal industry) don’t want to be out of business. True innovation comes from all of us and the only thing holding us back is the fear that our ideas won’t make enough money.

Except clean energy will win regardless of the failures of a democratic system, and all of the evidence shows it.

I would certainly hope so

I think the Prisoner’s Dilemma shows that greed, whether natural or not, can be a useful strategic position. The idea I think is to create a system with checks and balances, and to not be afraid to restructure those checks and balances once they are obviously not working (like in the US.)

No, and that’s why it fails.

If we are going to go over this, we first have to take a look at greed and its impact on society and the reason it happens. What we know as greed is a chemical resistance in the brain that goes off when you get something like monetary gain, it is the same brain chemical circuitry as when addicts partake in cocaine, heroine, nicotine, overeating, or gambling. So how are we going to deal with this chemical reaction? Well, if we're going to deal with this reaction, we first have to understand why it exists in the first place. This reaction is seen as a primal impulse that aided survival throughout our evolutionary history. That urge to work, fight, protect, and collect possessions, such as tools, food, meat, shelter, and even a mate, kept people alive. Since money can get you all of these things, it is the main reason for greed nowadays. This chemical reaction is now limited to only about $70,000 in income. After that, there is a clear case of diminishing returns – called the "Futility Limit" by Herman Daly in Scientific America – with reported levels of happiness actually declining the more money people earn after that. So how can we use this chemical reaction in a communist society? Well, with your needs being met, it would make sense for someone to just not work if they didn't want to. Well, while people would have the option to not work if they didn't want to, they would still have to understand that if a ton of people didn't work, then they would be out of everything that they needed, like food. This knowledge would keep most people working because people would still want their basic needs met and they would understand they need as many people working to complete that job. That is how greed would work in a communist society and how we could use it for the betterment of the people.
