Medically reviewed by Megan Soliman, MD — Written by Oladimeji Ewumi — Updated on January 19, 2024

In 2020, a liver transplant cost around $878,400 for procurement, procedure, and aftercare. Insurance can often cover much of the cost, and some organizations can provide financial aid.

A liver transplant is a surgical procedure for people in the end stages of liver failure. A person may require a liver transplant when other treatment options are not able to restore liver function or reverse liver damage.

According to American Liver Foundation, about 6,000 liver transplants take place in the United States each year, and over 17,000 Americans are on the waiting list for a donor.

This article provides an overview of the cost of liver transplants. It also covers the other financial options available.

The cost of a liver transplant can vary depending on a person’s location, medical charges, healthcare facility, insurance coverage, and other factors.

Evidence from 2020 indicates that a liver transplant costs $878,400.

The cost of a liver transplant covers the entire bill of the procedure from 30 days before the transplant to 6 months after the surgery.

Procurement covers all services to recover the liver tissue from a donor. This includes the costs of retrieval, preservation, and transportation of the liver.

30-days pretransplantation

These are medical costs that a patient incurs 30 days before the hospital admission for a liver transplant. It can cover the costs of comprehensive physical, psychological, and laboratory testing. This can include crossmatching for donor compatibility, blood screening, and X-rays.

Hospital transplant admission

This fee covers admission and facility charges, including room and board, inpatient care, and other facility-based expenses.

These are charges for a doctor’s professional services during a liver transplant admission. It covers every surgical procedure per the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) guidelines.

Post-transplant discharge

This includes all hospital readmissions, lab testings, outpatient visits, and postsurgical complications 180 days after a liver transplant. It can consist of both transplant-related and nontransplant-related expenses.

Outpatient medications

It covers the cost of all prescription medications, including immunosuppressants, from discharge to 180 days after.

Liver transplants and health insurance

A person’s insurance plan will determine the coverage they can get. However, most insurance plans have a cap on the amount they can pay.

People who are in the end-stage of liver disease and require a liver transplant may be eligible for Medicare.

The liver transplant must be in a Medicare-approved facility to qualify for Medicare benefits. Medicare Parts A and B will cover transplants and other medically-important health services.

Medicare part A will cover the following costs for a person receiving a liver transplant and their living donor.

any necessary laboratory tests and physical exams

services required for a liver transplant

procurement of the liver

immunosuppressive, or transplant, drugs

Learn more about what Medicare part A covers.

Medicare part B will cover:

doctor’s or liver specialist’s visits

transplant drug therapy

certain immunosuppressive medications, if related to Medicare-covered liver transplant

Learn more about what Medicare part B covers.

A person receiving a liver transplant can purchase private health insurance plans that combine original Medicare Parts A and B in a single policy.

Medicare Advantage, or Medicare Part C, can help with the following out-of-pocket costs, which include:

emergency ambulance transportation

mental health counseling

physical, occupational, and speech therapy

Part C plans can also include a drug coverage known as Part D, which covers prescription drugs only.

A liver transplant patient may be eligible for a Part C if they:

already have Medicare Parts A and B

need more coverage for prescription drugs

After a person’s insurance has covered a good part of their liver transplant cost, they will still have to pay for other expenses, including:

transplant facility charges

lab tests not on the Medicare plan

20% of the Medicare-approved costs for doctor’s service

If they have secondary insurance, it can help cover the remaining medical expenses.

Medigap is a private insurance plan that can help cover costs left over by Original Medicare. These costs can include deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance following a liver transplant.

Medigap only pays after a person and Medicare have completed their medical services payments.

A person with secondary insurance may not need a Medigap plan since their second policy will pay for any additional expenses not covered by Medicare.

If a person is eligible for a liver transplant and needs free or low cost care based on certain income and family size requirements, they may be eligible for Medicaid.

Most Medicaid programs only cover liver transplants in their state unless there are no available transplant centers.

Medicaid can cover liver transplant costs that include:

laboratory and X-ray tests

personal care services

home-health services

The following financial aid programs assist people with their liver transplant costs:

American Transplant Foundation

Liver Health Connection

National Foundation for Transplants

Transplants Patients Trust in the United Kingdom

Does it cost money to donate part of a liver?

Most liver transplants are from deceased donors. However, less commonly, people may receive a liver transplant from a living donor, which involves someone donating part of their healthy liver. The remaining part of the liver in the donor and the section of liver in the person receiving the transplant grow back to normal size after surgery.

A person does not need to pay to donate part of their liver. The recipient’s insurance covers all medical expenses during the transplant evaluation and surgery. However, a person may be responsible for paying for their medical maintenance test to ensure they are healthy to donate their liver.

They may be responsible for some out-of-pocket travel expenses which the recipient’s insurance will not cover, such as:

travel expenses such as gas and airfare

food and lodging during the donor evaluation

lost wages during recovery

Health insurance can cover vital liver transplant costs, including hospital services, medical services, immunosuppressants, and post-transplant care.

Many insurance beneficiaries will still incur additional expenses. However, some financial options can help them cover it.

A person who requires a liver transplant should discuss any financial or insurance concerns with a financial coordinator at the transplant center. The financial coordinator will help them determine which insurance plan they are most eligible for and how to manage the cost of care.
