Political Correctness

E. Johnson, in Encyclopedia of Applied Ethics (Second Edition), 2012

Political correctness (PC) became a popular term at the beginning of the 1990s, as a negative characterization by members of the political/cultural right of restrictions on speech and behavior imposed by the left. The term figured in leftist-influenced movements, such as feminism, in the 1970s and 1980s. In the 1960s, if not before, leftists also applied the criterion of political correctness to one another’s actions somewhat ironically, in a spirit of self-mockery. But the term was used as a serious form of criticism as far back as the 1940s and 1950s, or earlier.Read more

Treating with dignity

Dennis H. Reid, Mary Rosswurm, in Promoting Desired Lifestyles Among Adults with Severe Autism and Intellectual Disabilities, 2023

The issue of political correctness

A concerning issue that can arise in determining dignified ways of treating adults with severe disabilities relates to political correctness. The issue is especially relevant in regard to how staff in adult service agencies refer to individuals in terms of having a severe disability (beyond adhering to personal preferences as noted above). Political correctness as discussed here pertains to adjusting one’s language for ideological purposes.

For adult service staff, it can sometimes be difficult to know if a currently accepted reference to individuals who have a severe disability represents what is truly acceptable to individuals and their families or what is politically correct at a given point in time. Relatedly, various staff are likely to dislike expectations of political correctness dictating how they speak. That dislike can be extended to new terminology that is introduced within their agency regarding reference to individuals with severe disabilities if the terminology is perceived to be based on political correctness. An example of the effects of this type of situation is presented in the following case illustration.

Drawn from Reid et al. (2018). No less worthy: Recommendations for behavior analysts treating adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities with dignity. Behavior Analysis in Practice, 11, 71–79.

Case illustration⁎

Background: A clinical practitioner and supervisor in an adult service agency became increasingly aware that the term “mental retardation” (which he had been using for years) was increasingly being replaced by “intellectual disabilities” in references to the challenges of the individuals served within his agency and elsewhere. His immediate response was that the change was basically an unwarranted case of political correctness. He therefore continued to refer to “mental retardation”, to the subtle but apparent displeasure of a number of people with whom he interacted while on the job.

Acknowledging the importance of new terminology. Due largely to information provided by a respected colleague, the practitioner then became aware that there were very good reasons for the change in terminology. Specifically, he became aware that self-advocates with an intellectual disability had been striving for decades to do away with the terms “mental retardation” and “retarded”, or what was referred to as the “R word” because of pejorative connotations. Additionally, he became aware that leading disability organizations that were advocating for use of “intellectual disabilities” were more knowledgeable of the desires of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their families in this area relative to his knowledge. He subsequently began referring to “intellectual disabilities” instead of “mental retardation.”

The case illustration reflects the importance of adult service staff distinguishing between what is politically correct in regard to referring to individuals versus what is considered most acceptable among people with severe disabilities and their family members. If the practitioner in the case illustration (first author of this book) had attended more readily to the reported desires of individuals and their families as well as the ongoing work of leading disability organizations, his terminology would have changed and been perceived as more dignified at a much earlier time. The essential point is that staff in adult service agencies should take actions to stay abreast of currently accepted language regarding the treatment of adults with severe disabilities and speak accordingly. It is likewise incumbent upon agency management to ensure staff receive relevant training in this regard when initially hired as well as through periodic professional development opportunities.Read more

Political Correctness

E. Johnson, in Encyclopedia of Applied Ethics (Second Edition), 2012

Stanley Fish notes that “in 1989, ‘political correctness’ had not yet become a code phrase for the supposed sins of the academic world” (1994: 28). By the end of 1990, journalists had picked up on the phrase, and in a May 1991 commencement address at the University of Michigan, President George Bush attacked political correctness by name. Social critics at that time, in such works as Roger Kimball’s Tenured Radicals: How Politics Has Corrupted Our Higher Education (1990), Dinesh D’Souza’s Illiberal Education: The Politics of Race and Sex on Campus (1991), and Arthur Schlesinger’s The Disuniting of America: Reflections on a Multicultural Society (1991), discerned a tyranny of politically correct speech, thought, and behavior, imposed on students by professors who had themselves been radical students in the 1960s. These tenured radicals, having failed to transform society, had retreated to the academy, where they were busy corrupting the next generation.

Many in the academy denied that such political correctness existed (other than as an occasional aberration). Anti-PC media critics such as George Will dismissed this denial as itself merely another PC phenomenon: “the new tenet of political correctness is that political correctness does not exist.” The term quickly caught on as a catchphrase for the debate between left and right about education and social progress. During the first half of the 1990s, political correctness became the subject of widespread commentary, analogized to everything from a “mild pressure … not unlike that resulting from parental insistence on politeness” (Elliot Richardson) to the slide that led the French Revolution from the Rights of Man to the Terror (Richard Bernstein, Dictatorship of Virtue, 1994).

An often recounted example involved a University of Pennsylvania administrator characterizing the word “individual” as “a ‘RED FLAG’ phrase today, which is considered by many to be RACIST. Arguments that champion the individual over the group ultimately privilege the ‘individuals’ who belong to the largest or dominant group.” Conservative critic D’Souza recounted being accused by an Afro-American Studies professor of having advanced racist views. The professor denied, however, that he was calling D’Souza a racist. “You are a person of color. You cannot be a racist. You don’t have power in this society. Only whites can be racist.”

Such rejection of familiar standards (the value of individualism and the unfairness of double standards) provokes anti-PC critics. The deeper issue raised by the debate can be easily seen in one of the central documents in the radicalization of the new left: Herbert Marcuse’s famous essay, “Repressive Tolerance” (1965). As he put the point in his 1968 postscript:

The Left has no equal voice, no equal access to the mass media and their public facilities – not because a conspiracy excludes it, but because … it does not have the required purchasing power. And the Left does not have the purchasing power because it is the Left. These conditions impose upon the radical minorities a strategy which is in essence a refusal to allow the continuous functioning of allegedly indiscriminate but in fact discriminate tolerance…. Not ‘equal’ but more representation of the Left would be equalization of the prevailing inequality. (Marcuse, 1968)

It is a short distance from this to the philosophy professor who is said to have defended proselytizing for Marxism in class by saying: “If they want the other side, they should watch TV or read the newspapers.” What makes political correctness an important topic in social theory and applied ethics is the question of whether this asymmetry can be justified.Read more

Implicit Bias and Accountability Systems: What Must Organizations Do to Prevent Discrimination?

Philip E. Tetlock, Gregory Mitchell, in Research in Organizational Behavior, 2009

The threshold-adjusting maneuvers also depend on motivated reasoning. Consider a market purist who sets a high threshold for accepting implicit-prejudice explanations. Motivated reasoning could help that observer bolster his or her value priority by:

highlighting the negative consequences of false-positive claims of implicit bias, such as encouraging conspiracy theories about Whites that are disturbingly common among African-American political elites (Simmons & Parsons, 2005), fostering a culture of victimology that some observers warn is already entrenched in African-American communities (S. Steele, 2006), imposing stultifying regimes of political correctness that can trigger reverse discrimination against Whites and high-achieving minorities (Aberson & Ettlin, 2004), and abetting frivolous class-action litigation that caricatures vast populations of managers as presumptively prejudiced;

minimizing the negative consequences of drawing false-negative exonerations of guilty organizations. Such arguments might exaggerate the efficacy of market forces and existing regulatory mechanisms to check what “little” prejudice remains.Read more

Political Correctness

E. Johnson, in Encyclopedia of Applied Ethics (Second Edition), 2012

Thinking about the political correction of speech habits and linguistic practices raises the question of the character of language itself. Many writers have lamented the decline of English grammar and usage. Though these complaints have a point, they tend to overlook the fact that language is not static.

Feminist critics, for example, have suggested a variety of ways in which familiar English usage could be improved in order to diminish linguistic sexism. Such correction can be faddish and polemical at the expense of etymological sense – “herstory,” for example. In other cases, the issues are more substantive. English is a language that marks gender. Is this a problem? Is there a universal meaning of “man” and “he,” in addition to a male one? Should there be?

Many PC innovations flow out of concern about the power of language to stigmatize individuals or groups. But often it seems as though no language could ever be satisfactory, because of the perennial need to flee from unwanted connotations. Terms concerning disability are an example: “crippled,” “handicapped,” and “disabled” have yielded to “physically challenged,” or even “differently abled.” The same has been true of terms for race and sex. As Henry Louis Gates, Jr., put it in 1969: “My grand-father was colored, my father was a Negro, and I am black.” More recently, “black” has in turn fallen into disfavor, replaced by “African American” (even, sometimes, “person of color”). “African American” has the advantage of seeming on a par with ethnic labels such as “Italian American,” but the analogy is false, as can be seen by asking whether Americans of Egyptian descent count as African Americans. What has the trip from “colored” to “people of color” really accomplished?

The debate about good English has also been altered by the tendency to translate what used to be seen as issues about proper usage into claims about dialect alternatives. Beginning in the 1970s, a number of linguists argued for reconceptualizing many instances of bad English into legitimate forms of Black English. For this reason, among others, elementary and secondary education has tended to de-emphasize the correction/normalization of writing and talking in favor of approaches (praised and vilified under the name of self-esteem) that allegedly encourage individuality and creativity. Critics claim that such an approach does native speakers of Black English a disservice, since it ill prepares them to compete linguistically in a society where standard English is the norm. This oft-repeated argument may be correct, though it is open to the reply that changing population demographics may mean that standard English is (or soon will be) no longer the standard.

When we look at Shakespeare – a man who spelled his name in a variety of ways – we may be reminded that great periods of literature have not necessarily required uniformity of spelling, grammar, or usage.Read more

Political Correctness

E. Johnson, in Encyclopedia of Applied Ethics (Second Edition), 2012

Some would doubt whether it is possible to be an antiessentialist liberal. Stanley Fish, who has been called the high priest of political correctness, is one of the most vocal critics of liberalism, which he considers incoherent. In his criticism of liberal values, Fish is an important source of the view that notions such as free speech and discrimination have a different meaning for victims and for oppressors.

It is in the critique of liberal values that the negative rationale for multiculturalism takes its most powerful and disturbing form. Politics is seen as pervasive because notions of neutrality, impartiality, objectivity, fairness, and so on, have no absolute character. On Fish’s analysis, there is no neutral standpoint to be occupied. Accordingly, the claim of traditional values to proceed from an impartial process should be unmasked: we should engage nakedly in politics, because everything is political already, since “the truths any of us find compelling will all be partial, which is to say they will all be political.”

The attack on political correctness is in Fish’s view misconceived: “Political correctness, the practice of making judgments from the vantage point of challengeable convictions, is not the name of a deviant behavior but of the behavior that everyone necessarily practices.” Though he argues for the pervasiveness of politics, he also defends the autonomy of professional standards (professional correctness) against demands for political relevance and action; he is “for politics and against Politics (the new transcendence).” For Fish, postmodernist stories about the constructed character of disciplines, and their dependence on scholarly and interpretive communities, are right, but the construction still creates a reality, albeit a partial and impermanent one.

Though Fish’s views were apparently formed independently of influence from Kuhn, it is instructive to see them as a version of Kuhn’s distinction between normal science (subject to established paradigms) and revolutionary science. Kuhn, Rorty, and Fish have helped popularize the notion that what we know depends crucially on communities that serve as interpreters of meaning, evidence, and argument. Their work has helped to smooth the way for an American version of social constructionism.Read more

Gender and Feminist Studies in Political Science

C. Johnson, in International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioral Sciences, 2001

7 Feminism, Political Science, and Policy

In short, contemporary feminists are still debating, and stretching, the limits of the political. In Vickers's phrase (1997), feminists need to ‘reinvent’ political science. However, political science also poses a number of challenges to feminist theory and practice. Key amongst these is the challenge posed by the policy-making process. For example, critiques of the universalizing category ‘woman’ can be useful in the policy-making process when the resulting sensitization to difference draws attention to the need to develop programs that address a range of women's problems, experiences, and lives. They can be less helpful if the differentiation goes so far that the desirability of feminists establishing women-focused programs is brought into question, or if feminists deny the insights that can be drawn across cultures from old feminist concepts such as gender stereotyping or the public/private divide (Lee 1995, Herrick and Sapieva 1997). Similarly, queer theory can be useful for drawing attention to the ways in which both minority and mainstream identities exclude those who are not seen to belong. The insights of queer theory can be less useful if the need for specifically lesbian advocacy or services is ignored. Arguing for a plurality of interpretations may well be a useful feminist political strategy in the fields of literature or film that prevents gendered meanings being fixed. Eventually, however, policy-makers will need to make definite decisions and implement specific programs. Debates over recognition and redistribution usefully draw attention to the need for programs that address both aspects but are less useful if they lead to the privileging of one aspect over the other. Critiques of dual categories can be useful for drawing attention to the discursive subordination of the feminine but are less useful if dichotomous thinking is seen as the fundamental source of women's inequality that must be addressed. Here, as elsewhere, a combination of judicious eclecticism and sensitivity to difference and multiplicity can be helpful in negotiating the complex engagements between feminism and political science.

The relationship between feminism and political science has also been complicated by the times. The backlash against so-called ‘political correctness’ in many English-speaking countries has made it more acceptable to not merely dismiss feminist critiques of gender bias but to accuse feminists of silencing and marginalizing men. As indicated previously, the institutions and organizations of gender politics now include various aggrieved men's groups—groups mobilizing over issues of child custody, divorce settlements, and parental support—as well as women's organizations and gay and lesbian organizations. The impact of economic globalization and rapid social and technological change has contributed to an environment in which appeals to nostalgia, including gendered forms such as bringing back dependent stay-at-home Mums and reliable male breadwinners, can be electorally attractive to women as well as men. Meanwhile, the influence of neoliberalism, particularly in English-speaking countries, has undermined those feminist critiques of male dominance and female disadvantage that relied on state action to redress the balance. While there are forms of neoliberalism that attempt to incorporate some women into conceptions of the self-reliant individual, others flirt with forms of social conservatism which privilege more traditional gender relations.

All of this has made the engagement between feminism, gender studies, and political science more complex. It has also meant that analyses must be updated constantly. While appeals to nostalgia ensure that older feminist analyses are unlikely to be totally superseded, there is a need to develop analyses that can deal with the evolving political discourses and practices of the twenty-first century. Earlier feminist analyses concentrated on analyzing the politics of exclusion and marginalization. However, increasingly, feminists may need to develop sophisticated analyses of new forms of political inclusion and incorporation, (and new forms of masculinities and femininities), as changes in gender politics are played out in numerous sites and discourses. In the process, mainstream political science could usefully learn to be as self-critical and reflective as feminism has become.Read more

The biopsychology of emotion: Current theoretical and empirical perspectives

Eddie Harmon-Jones, ... Carly K. Peterson, in Biological Psychology, 2010

To test these ideas, Zinner et al. (2008) created a social context in which the experience of anger was considered socially inappropriate. Given the norms encouraging political correctness and discouraging public expressions of racial prejudice (Plant and Devine, 1998), some individuals may become angered by the pressure to behave in a politically correct (PC) manner but also want to avoid expressing anger, leading them to withdraw. Along these lines, past research found that some people feel anger when required to comply with social pressure to respond without racial prejudice (Plant and Devine, 2001).Read more

The existence of implicit bias is beyond reasonable doubt: A refutation of ideological and methodological objections and executive summary of ten studies that no manager should ignore

John T. Jost, ... Curtis D. Hardin, in Research in Organizational Behavior, 2009

In conclusion, it seems to us that a world in which individuals, including organizational leaders, recognize the need for “unconsciousness raising” with respect to the subtle, often unintended effects of stigma, stereotyping, and prejudice will be a better world—and not at all a “stultifying regime of political correctness,” as Tetlock and Mitchell (2009, p. 24) worry. The danger seems small that we—as citizens or as social scientists—would be requiring too much of ourselves (or our organizations) by taking seriously the hundreds (if not thousands) of studies on implicit bias. These studies testify to the enduring historical (and psychological) legacies of racism, sexism, and other forms of group-based inequality and they suggest, not so surprisingly after all, that these legacies have left behind at least some residue in our hearts and minds.Read more
