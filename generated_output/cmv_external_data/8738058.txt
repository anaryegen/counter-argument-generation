Quality of Life is a highly subjective measure of happiness that is an important component of many financial decisions.

What Is Quality of Life?

Many people think of quality of life as a very subjective assessment. But it is also an essential component of many financial decisions such as the job you take and the place you live. The factors that play a role in measuring a person's quality of life vary according to personal preferences but often include financial security as well as job satisfaction, family life, social connections, health, and safety.

Financial decisions often involve a tradeoff in which the present quality of life is decreased to save money or earn more money for the future.

Quality of life is a subjective term that can vary depending on many different factors and is different for each individual.

Quality of life factors include the cost of living, housing affordability, commute time, quality of healthcare, and purchasing power.

The countries with the best quality of life include Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Oman.

Governments can improve a country's quality of life by providing more safety, better infrastructure, controlling costs, and improving the healthcare system.

Understanding Quality of Life

Quality of life is strongly associated with financial factors beyond the basic necessities of food and shelter. More money often means access to greater comfort, freedom from many anxieties, and an optimistic outlook for the future.

Inevitably, job satisfaction is a key component of quality of life. For many of us, it determines our degree of satisfaction with half of our waking hours. Add in the importance of a paycheck and it affects many other aspects of our lives.

If a job provides time to enjoy life but leaves the worker too tired, injured, stressed out, or otherwise unable to enjoy their earnings, it subtracts from quality of life. Today, it is common to weigh both salary and quality of life when considering how good or bad a job is.

Quality of life is also an issue when developing a personal savings plan. In this case, the tradeoff involves sacrificing current quality of life to improve future quality of life. This may include postponing luxuries and leisure activities that improve our overall sense of well-being.

Quality of Life Factors

Quality of life can be measured in many different ways. Numbeo's Quality of Life index focuses on the following eight factors.

Purchasing power determines how much goods and services a population can buy with a given unit of currency. Ideally, the more goods and services that can be bought, the better.

Safety is measured in a variety of ways, such as crime levels, the ability to walk alone at night, and digital, infrastructure, and personal safety. It can include crime statistics, well-being indicators, safe spaces, and community power.

Healthcare evaluates the quality of a nation's healthcare system. It considers factors such as healthcare professionals, equipment, staff, doctors, costs, infrastructure, services, and accessibility.

Cost of living evaluates how much it costs to live in a specific place. It assesses the relative prices of consumer goods, such as groceries, housing (rent or mortgage), entertainment, transportation, utilities, and restaurants.

Property Price to Income

This metric seeks to determine the affordability of housing. It evaluates the property prices of an area to the income of the population. If property prices are too high compared to income, it makes housing less affordable, reducing the quality of life.

Traffic Commute Time

A short commute to work is a good quality of life. It is often possible to save money on housing by living farther away from work but the trade-off is less time to spend with family or hobbies and more time sitting in traffic or waiting for a train. A healthy, short commute to work improves one's quality of life.

Pollution indexes evaluate the overall pollution levels in a certain place. Factors taken into consideration include air and water pollution, garbage disposal, cleanliness, noise and light pollution, green spaces, and comfort in relation to pollution.

A good climate with moderate temperatures and low humidity is seen as improving the quality of life. An absence of dangerous weather events, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and tornadoes is also considered in climate metrics when evaluating quality of life.

Quality of life depends on the individual, but access to good healthcare, clean and safe housing, healthy food, and a living wage are near-universal factors.

How to Improve Quality of Life

If you feel your quality of life is lacking, considering how you define a good quality of life is an excellent first step towards improvement. While everyone's idea of a high-quality life varies, there are some universal markers.

These markers may include access to good healthcare, loving relationships, meaningful work or volunteerism, leisure time for hobbies you enjoy, good rest, healthy food, and the ability to perform an enjoyable form of exercise.

Studies have found that practicing gratitude and meditation can improve your quality of life. Experts recommend adequate sleep (at least seven hours per night) to improve the quality of life and better control mood and energy levels.

How Governments Can Improve Quality of Life

Governments can look to data collected from happiness economic studies and indices to find places to improve the population's quality of life. One such index is the Gross National Happiness (GNH) index.

The latest version of the index, based on a survey of 5,000 Americans, concludes that Delaware residents have the highest life satisfaction, while Oregon residents are in last place.

There are many ways that a government can improve the quality of its citizens' lives. Actions include funding good public schools, offering affordable access to healthcare, and supporting family-friendly policies like paid leave to take care of sick family members or newborn or adopted children. These policy movements help families thrive.

Many of the governments in countries listed as having a high quality of life provide services and programs to their citizens to help them improve their lives. These include access to living-wage jobs, affordable or free higher education, better gun control laws, and access to high-quality and affordable healthcare.

The quality of life in the U.S. is lower than in many developed nations due to declines in personal safety, high healthcare costs, and uneven access to high-quality public education.

What Are the Primary Indicators of Quality of Life?

Some primary indicators of quality of life include sufficient income, job satisfaction, decent housing, access to high-quality education, a reasonable life-work balance, rewarding personal relationships, and access to cultural and leisure activities.

How Can We Improve Quality of Life?

Work on improving your work-life balance, relationships, home, and health.

Governments can improve the quality of life in their countries by offering affordable and accessible healthcare, investing in education, providing affordable housing, offering family-friendly policies, and putting laws into place for workers to earn living wages.

How Is Quality of Life Calculated?

Quality of life can be calculated in many ways. One is from the World Health Organization: "WHO defines Quality of Life as an individual's perception of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards, and concerns."

What Are the 4 Types of Quality of Life?

The United Nations University World Institute for Development Economics Research (UNU WIDER) provides four qualities of life:

Livability of the environment

Life-ability of the individual

External utility of Life

Inner appreciation of life

Quality of life is, above all, an individual calculation. Most of us, however, include good health, good friends, loving relationships, and some degree of creature comforts in the factors they assess. It may sound distasteful, but the money we have and the ways we get it have a big role in many of the factors that make up quality of life.
