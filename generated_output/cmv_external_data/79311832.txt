One great way to help you overcome over analyzing things is seeking professional help so that they can direct you accordingly.

3. You constantly think of worst case scenarios:

None of us are soothsayers and no one knows what the future has in store for us, Problems have a knack of suddenly making an appearance at times when we least expect it.

As human beings all we can do is live each day to the fullest, make each moment count and place our trust in God, hoping that he will guide and protect us.

Faith is something that really helps sooth the nerves of people rather than fretting about things.

4. You focus on the distant future without enjoying the present:

The future is a mystery to us all and worrying about it does not solve any problems. If you end up focusing entirely on the future you might miss out on all the great things that are happening in your life today.

You as an over thinker must realize that once you do your best you should let events take their natural course.

They always try to dig just a bit deeper and contemplate just a little more to ensure that they have taken into consideration every facet of the problem and that there is no stone that they have left unturned when it comes to a peculiar situation.

However sometimes when a person says something you should realize that he or she has no ulterior motive, there is nothing more to the story and maybe you should leave it at that!

6. You try reading between the lines even when there is nothing to read!:

The trait of over-analyzing is like an obsessive-compulsive disorder of sorts, but pertaining to the mind.

Even if the smallest of chance occurrence take place they try and read deep into it and excavate a hidden meaning. These traits make it very difficult for individuals to be friends which such people.

However, this is a habit that ought to be handled delicately so that the individual does not go on to feel isolated.

7. Take little things very seriously:

A sure sign that you are an over thinker is that you take even the smallest of things very seriously; even a joke cracked by an individual is something which you end up taking to heart.

It is okay to be serious in life, however, it is important to realize that all friends joke and they hardly ever mean what they say, you must try to be mature enough not to be so over-sensitive when it comes to light-hearted comments, otherwise over time people might choose to stop communicating with you at all.

8. You tend to blow small things out of proportion:

At no point in your life should you keep quiet if you think that you ought to raise your voice however it is also important to make sure that you do not end up blowing even the smallest of things out of proportion, much to the irritation of people around.

So if you are an over thinker then what you should try to do is differentiate major issues from small ones and do not concentrate on the things that do not matter much. Doing this will really help you react as per the situation at hand.

9. You blindly assume a lot of things:

Owing to the fact that you have so much going on in your mind you often end up missing out on things that are actually going on in the present moment.

People that keep overthinking things in their minds always end up spoiling their own mood and giving themselves a headache! So it is better to stop overthinking.

A great thing to do is trying to focus on the positives that might come out of a situation rather than thinking of the negatives. Doing this is a great tip indeed to sooth the nerves of overthinkers.

You take great pains to ensure that you do not let even the tiniest of this pass. Rather than letting something go and feeling liberated, you prefer to harp on it.

Letting things go is something that does not come easily to all, but if you gradually learn the art of it, over time you will feel free and alive with no heavy burden on your shoulders.

14. You never act impulsively:
