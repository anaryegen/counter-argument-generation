Psychedelic and dissociative drugs can temporarily alter a person’s mood, thoughts, and perceptions. Among other health effects and safety concerns, people who use these substances report feeling strong emotions ranging from bliss to fear and experiencing vast changes in how they perceive reality.

In recent years, there has been growing research interest in the potential of psychedelic and dissociative drugs to treat medical conditions, including mental health disorders. An increasing number of people also report taking these drugs outside of medical settings for recreation, to improve well-being, or for spiritual or self-exploration.

NIDA supports and conducts research to better understand the health effects of psychedelic and dissociative drugs and to learn whether some of these drugs may help treat substance use disorders in medical settings.

What are psychedelic and dissociative drugs?

Psychedelic and dissociative drugs can temporarily alter a person’s mood, thoughts, and perceptions of reality.1 Among other health effects and safety concerns, people who use psychedelic and dissociative drugs report feeling strong emotions, ranging from intense happiness and a feeling of connectedness to fear, anxiety, and confusion.2,3 People who use these drugs also report experiencing intense or distorted visions or sensations.1

Many psychedelic drugs derive from plants and fungi, and some have been used for thousands of years in traditional or religious rituals. Some psychedelic and dissociative drugs are also synthetic (lab-made).2 People report using psychedelic and dissociative drugs for a variety of reasons, including seeking new, fun, healing, or spiritual experiences.1,3

NIDA conducts and supports research on psychedelic and dissociative drugs to help inform policies and health decisions around their use. Researchers are also studying whether some of these substances may be effective treatments for mental health disorders, including addiction, when administered in a clinical setting.4,5

While researchers debate how to describe and classify psychedelic and dissociative drugs and other drugs with similar properties, they generally group these drugs according to how they work in the brain.3 Some people use the term “hallucinogens” to refer to all or some psychedelic and dissociative drugs.

Drugs that primarily influence the way the brain processes the chemical serotonin. They can bring on vivid visions and affect a person’s sense of self.2

Includes: psilocybin, LSD, DMT, mescaline, NBOMes

Drugs that primarily affect how the brain processes the chemical glutamate. These drugs can make people feel disconnected from their body and environment.6

Includes: ketamine, PCP

Drugs such as MDMA,7 ibogaine,8 and salvia9 affect a variety of brain functions to cause psychedelic and/or dissociative effects.

All of these substances have mind-altering properties with the potential to cause changes in thought processes, mood, and perception of reality.3,7,8,9

Psychedelic drugs (also called “classic psychedelics” or “psychedelics”), including psilocybin and LSD, mainly interact with specific receptors, which are molecular structures in the brain. Known as 5-hydroxy-tryptamine (5-HT)2A receptors, these are targets for the neurotransmitter (chemical messenger) serotonin. At certain doses, psychedelics may bring on vivid visions or sensations, alter a person’s sense of self, and promote feelings of insightfulness or connection.10

Dissociative drugs, including ketamine and PCP, block the action of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. These are part of the brain’s system for transporting glutamate, another neurotransmitter. While dissociative drugs can alter perception, they also typically make people feel disconnected from their body and environment.6

Other drugs such as MDMA, ibogaine, and salvia work on a variety of brain functions to cause psychedelic or dissociative effects. For more information, see “How do psychedelic and dissociative drugs work in the brain?”

How do psychedelic and dissociative drugs affect the mind and body?

NIDA supports and conducts research on the short- and long-term health effects of psychedelic and dissociative drugs to better inform health decisions and policies related to their use. While research is ongoing, scientific studies have revealed important information about how these drugs work:

Effects vary widely. Effects of psychedelic and dissociative drugs may be difficult to predict and depend on many factors. These include the amount taken and potency (concentration and strength), as well as a person’s unique biology, age, sex, personality, mood, expectations, mindset—commonly called “set”—and environment, or “setting.”3,11 Using psychedelic and dissociative drugs that contain contaminants or using them in combination with other substances may also produce effects not associated with using these drugs alone.12

Psychedelic and dissociative drugs temporarily alter thought patterns, mood, and perceptions of reality. People who use these substances report feeling strong emotions, ranging from intense happiness and a feeling of connectedness to fear, anxiety, and confusion.1,3 Many people who use psychedelic drugs, such as psilocybin and LSD, report seeing vibrant shapes, colors, and scenes and reliving vivid memories.10 People who use dissociative drugs, such as ketamine and PCP, describe experiencing distorted vision and hearing.6

Dissociative drugs can make people feel “detached.” Many people who use dissociative drugs report feeling as though they are floating or are disconnected from their body.13

People may experience adverse health effects. Physical side-effects of these substances, such as headache, nausea, or changes in heart rate, are generally not life-threatening.14 However, illicitly manufactured or processed drugs may be contaminated with colorless and odorless fentanyl or other dangerous substances that can cause serious adverse events, including overdose and death.15 Psychedelic or dissociative drugs may also produce adverse or debilitating psychological effects such as fear or anxiety.3,16 Research is ongoing to better understand short- and long-term health effects of psychedelic and dissociative drugs. For more information, see “Are psychedelic and dissociative drugs safe?”

Using psychedelic and dissociative drugs has been linked to dangerous behavior and injuries. People using these drugs may have impaired thought processes and perception that cause them to behave in unusual and sometimes dangerous ways. This may lead to injuries and other safety issues, particularly if there is not another individual present who can help prevent or respond to an emergency.14 For more information, see “Are psychedelic and dissociative drugs safe?”

How do psychedelic and dissociative drugs work in the brain?

More studies are needed to better understand how psychedelic and dissociative drugs work. While researchers debate how to describe these drugs and how specific drugs should be classified, they generally group them according to what is known about how they work in the brain. Better understanding these mechanisms is an active area of NIDA-funded research. This basic research plays an important role in identifying their health effects and potential therapeutic uses.

Although research is ongoing, studies suggest psychedelic drugs—such as psilocybin, LSD, and DMT—primarily affect 5-HT2A receptors in the brain, which ordinarily are activated by the neurotransmitter (chemical messenger) serotonin.10

Research suggests that the most prominent psychedelic effects stem from activity in the brain’s prefrontal cortex, an area involved in mood, cognition, and perception.17,18 Psychedelic drugs also temporarily disrupt communication between different brain regions, including the regions collectively known as the default mode network (DMN). The DMN is most active during brain activity that’s related to self-awareness—such as reflecting on past events or making plans.19 This may account for why psychedelic drugs can make a person’s thoughts less self-centered and more expansive, promoting a sense of connectedness with others and the world.10

Dissociative drugs, such as ketamine and PCP, also affect the balance of certain chemicals in the brain.6 Some of these changes lead to altered perception, as well as feelings of being disconnected from the body or environment.20 Ketamine and PCP disrupt the actions of the brain chemical glutamate at a type of receptor called the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor.6 Glutamate plays a major role in learning and memory, emotion, and the perception of pain.7

Researchers are also investigating other drugs sometimes classified as psychedelic and dissociative drugs, such as MDMA, and the way they work in the brain.

MDMA stimulates the brain to release serotonin and weakly activates serotonin receptors in the brain, producing some mind-altering effects associated with psychedelic drugs. MDMA also increases activity of other neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and norepinephrine, which are involved in mood and attention.7

Other drugs that produce effects associated with psychedelic and dissociative drugs work differently. For example, salvia activates kappa opioid receptors in the brain,21 while ibogaine affects a variety of brain receptors.8

How is NIDA advancing research on psychedelic and dissociative drugs?

NIDA conducts and supports research on psychedelic and dissociative drugs to help inform health decisions and policies related to their use. This research includes efforts to better understand the health effects of psychedelic and dissociative drugs, how chemicals in—or similar to—these drugs work in the brain, and whether they may be able to treat substance use disorders and other conditions. NIDA also funds research on how and why people use these substances.

In June 2022, NIDA’s Office of Translational Initiatives and Program Innovations also announced a new program to support small businesses to develop psychedelic-based therapies for substance use disorders.

Along with other agencies, NIDA also supports major coordination efforts in this evolving field, such as the 2022 Psychedelics as Therapeutics workshop co-sponsored by the National Institute on Mental Health and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Addiction.

Why do people use psychedelic and dissociative drugs?

People report using psychedelic and dissociative drugs for a variety of reasons. People may use them for their mind- and mood-altering effects, for recreation, or to have an emotional or spiritual experience. Individuals also report using these drugs in the hopes of improving their mental health or well-being or easing pain or stress, but more research is needed to determine their effectiveness for these purposes.1,3,22

Some psychedelic drugs are derived from plants and fungi that have a long history of use in many different cultures around the world.23 Aztec shamans used psilocybin in healing rituals, and some Native American tribes used peyote as long ago as 5,700 B.C. in religious ceremonies.24 References to psychedelic drug use have been found in ancient texts from India and Greece.2

More recently, researchers are exploring the use of psychedelic and dissociative drugs in medical settings as treatments for substance use disorders and for other mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).4,25

Are psychedelic and dissociative drugs safe?

While more research is needed, the reported incidence of serious adverse events from professionally supervised use of specific psychedelic and dissociative drugs, such as in clinical trials, is relatively low.2,10,11,26 However, many past clinical studies on these drugs have not adequately assessed or reported on adverse events.27

Most people who report using psychedelic and dissociative drugs do so outside of medical or research settings.1,28 While further research is also needed to better understand the health and safety impacts of typical use of these drugs, some serious adverse effects and safety issues have been identified.14,27

Effects vary widely. Effects of psychedelic and dissociative drugs may be difficult to predict and depend on many factors. These include the amount taken and potency (concentration and strength), as well as a person’s age, unique biology, sex, personality, history of drug use, mood, expectations, mindset, and surroundings (sometimes called “set and setting”).3,10,11 Using psychedelic and dissociative drugs that contain contaminants or using them in combination with other substances may also produce effects not associated with using these drugs alone.12,13,15

Short-term physical side effects are typically mild or moderate but may require professional care. People who take psychedelic or dissociative drugs may experience short-term side effects such as a headache, abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, high blood pressure, rapid heartbeat, trembling, and diarrhea.4,29 These are typically mild or moderate but may require medical care.30 Importantly, reported cases of side-effects likely represent only a very small number of people who use psychedelic or dissociative drugs, and most people who use these drugs do not seek emergency services. However, related data can provide insights on the side effects that may lead people to seek help. For example, according to U.S. poison control hotline data from 2000-2016, the most common negative short-term effects experienced by people who called in about using LSD and psilocybin were agitation, rapid heartbeat, pupil dilation, confusion, and vomiting. An analysis of these data found about 17% of these callers (600 people) who had used LSD and 6% of callers (363 people) who had used psilocybin mushrooms were admitted to critical care.31

Adverse reactions include fear and anxiety. People may also feel extreme emotions such as fear, confusion, or panic. These challenging experiences are also known as having a “bad trip.”32 Research on the extent to which such experiences occur and their impact on health is limited, in part because definitions and reporting of these experiences vary.

Using psychedelic and dissociative drugs has been linked to dangerous behavior and injuries. People using these drugs may have impaired thought processes and perception that causes them to behave in unusual or dangerous ways. This may lead to injuries and other safety issues, particularly if there is no one else present who can help prevent or respond to an emergency.14 In a survey of almost 2,000 people who took psilocybin outside of a medical setting and had a challenging experience, 11% said they had put themselves or others at risk of harm.33 More research is needed to better understand the impact of psychedelic and dissociative drugs on driving, operating heavy machinery, or performing other tasks that could be dangerous if impaired.

Emerging evidence suggests certain psychedelic and dissociative drugs may contain dangerous adulterants. For more information, see “Can psychedelic and dissociative drugs be adulterated with fentanyl and other dangerous contaminants?”

Fatal overdoses and serious adverse effects are rarely associated with typical use of commonly used psychedelic and dissociative drugs.14,34,35 A 2004 analysis of multiple studies estimated that psilocybin and LSD both have a safety ratio of 1000, meaning that the lethal dose of either drug is about 1000 times larger than a person would typically take for non-medical use.36 However, some psychedelic and dissociative drugs—including NBOMes,37,38 ibogaine,39 and PCP40 —have been associated with a small number of reported deaths and serious adverse health effects. Though more research is needed, evidence to date shows that fatal overdoses involving these substances are typically associated with taking very high doses or using combinations of drugs, particularly combining these substances with alcohol, or being placed in excessive physical restraints while displaying unsafe behavior.16 More research is needed to understand to what extent certain psychedelic and dissociative drugs may be mixed with contaminants (such as fentanyl) that may cause an overdose. For more information, see “Can psychedelic and dissociative drugs be adulterated with fentanyl and other dangerous contaminants?”

Drug interactions may influence effects. Though more study in this area is needed and reported cases are exceedingly rare, some researchers suspect psychedelic drugs may interact with other drugs or medications a person has taken, including prescription medicines that also increase levels of the hormone serotonin in the brain. Too much serotonin in the brain is called serotonin toxicity or serotonin syndrome. Symptoms are typically mild but can be life-threatening in rare cases.41,42

Use of some psychedelic and dissociative drugs rarely cause a condition called hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD). Some people report recurrently perceiving the same images or scenes and having the same mood changes they experienced when they were under the influence of a psychedelic or dissociative drug sometime in the past. These perceptions, or “flashbacks,” are typically mild and brief, lasting for seconds or minutes and occurring within a week of taking a substance.43 However, people with HPPD report that these episodes last longer and can reoccur even years after an experience with a substance, causing distress and other problems that impact their lives.44,45 Research on HPPD so far is limited and has relied mainly on self-reports on types and doses of the drugs believed to have caused these symptoms. More research is needed to assess how and why HPPD occurs and to find ways to help prevent and treat it.

Some psychedelic and dissociative drugs have been associated with specific long-term health problems. Research shows that long-term use of ketamine may cause ketamine-induced uropathy, a treatable but potentially serious condition that causes symptoms similar to those of a urinary tract infection.46 Limited research also suggests using MDMA (considered by some to have psychedelic properties) may be associated with mild or moderate heart valve disease, in which one or more of the four valves controlling blood flow from the heart do not function normally.47 In an analysis of studies conducted from 2015 through 2020, ibogaine use was associated with long QT syndrome, in which the electric impulses that control heartbeats function irregularly.48

Research on long-term mental health effects of psychedelic and dissociative drugs is ongoing. More research is needed to better understand the long-term impacts of psychedelic and dissociative drugs on mental health. Mental health complications from psychedelic and dissociative drugs are currently extremely rare in clinical research settings, in part because these studies are highly controlled and participants are screened for existing mental illnesses.32 For more information, see “What is the relationship between psychedelic and dissociative drugs and mental illness?”

Can psychedelic and dissociative drugs be used as medicine?

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the ketamine derivative esketamine (under the brand name Spravato®) as a treatment for severe depression in patients who do not respond to other treatments.49 The FDA has also granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for two formulations of psilocybin being studied as potential medical treatments for depression.

NIDA supports and conducts research to learn whether some of these drugs may help treat substance use disorders in medical settings.

What is the relationship between psychedelic and dissociative drugs and mental illness?

While scientists are still studying their effects, research suggests that some psychedelic and dissociative drugs may promote positive changes in thinking and mood.3 Researchers have suggested that these effects, including changes in brain functions that promote openness to new thoughts and experiences, may be valuable for supplementing mental health treatment.50 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the ketamine derivative esketamine (under the brand name Spravato®) as a treatment for severe depression in patients who do not respond to other treatments. The FDA has also granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for two formulations of psilocybin being studied as potential medical treatments for depression.

While short-term positive and negative mood changes are common with psychedelic and dissociative drugs, more research is needed to better understand the long-term effects these substances may have on mental health.

There is some evidence that psychedelic drugs might bring about or trigger schizophrenia-like illness in people with predisposing factors, but little evidence that they cause long-term psychiatric problems for most people. In a 1996 study where people with pre-existing psychoses were given LSD, three of 65 participants experienced persistent worsening of their psychiatric symptoms lasting 3-8 months.51

In modern psychedelic research, as a precaution, participants with previously diagnosed psychosis or bipolar disorder, and sometimes other mental illnesses, are excluded from participation. Under these conditions, the risk of psychosis or suicide among people who participate in research on psychedelic drugs, or who receive them as medication, is extremely low.52 An analysis of 34 clinical studies of LSD, psilocybin, or ayahuasca, published from 2006-2020 and involving 549 participants, found no evidence of longer-term adverse effects.26 However, poor mental health outcomes may be more likely outside of clinical use.14

Research suggests, though, that the dissociative drugs PCP41 and ketamine53 can make symptoms worse in people who have schizophrenia, and can cause short-term episodes of psychosis, in which a person experiences hallucinations and delusions, and has trouble experiencing what is real and what is not. PCP can also cause psychosis that persists for days to weeks.6,54 While it is not clear whether ketamine raises the risk of long-term psychosis, people who engage in regular recreational use of ketamine are more likely to experience delusions, even after weeks of abstinence.55 Animal studies show that long-term use of PCP or ketamine can cause brain changes resembling those seen in people with schizophrenia.56

One analysis found higher rates of suicidal ideation—thinking about, considering or planning suicide—but not attempted or completed suicide, in people who took esketamine, a ketamine derivative, compared to venlafaxine, an antidepressant medication.57 In another analysis of 25 studies, medically unsupervised ketamine use was associated with related substance use disorder symptoms, memory loss, depression, and anxiety.58

Can psychedelic and dissociative drugs be adulterated with fentanyl and other dangerous contaminants?

Many illicitly manufactured or processed drugs are increasingly found to contain contaminants that produce effects—including overdose and death—not associated with the substance or amount of substance a person intended to take.28,59 Adulteration of heroin, cocaine, and other drugs with highly potent fentanyl and related substances is a major contributor to rising drug overdose deaths.60 Because fentanyl and related substances are colorless and odorless, they are difficult to detect without chemical testing. This means adulteration of psychedelic and dissociative drugs with fentanyl and similar compounds is possible, but more research is needed to understand to what extent this occurs. Some organizations are using harm reduction practices to help avoid drug overdose deaths related to possible adulteration of certain psychedelic and dissociative drugs, particularly those taken in pill, powder, or liquid form.15

How do psychedelic and dissociative drugs affect pregnancy?

The effects of psychedelic and dissociative drugs during pregnancy are not well understood, as data are limited. PCP use during pregnancy has been linked to a range of congenital abnormalities in an infant’s heart, lung, urinary, cardiovascular, respiratory, urinary, and musculoskeletal systems.61 Some laboratory and epidemiological studies suggest MDMA (considered by some to have psychedelic properties) may cause motor delays and congenital abnormalities (particularly heart defects) in infants exposed to it during pregnancy.62,63

Are psychedelic and dissociative drugs addictive? Can people experience withdrawal?

To be diagnosed with a substance use disorder, a person must meet specific diagnostic criteria for continued substance use despite negative consequences. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)—a reference text professionals use to diagnose substance use disorders and other psychiatric disorders—includes diagnoses of phencyclidine (PCP) use disorder and “other hallucinogen use disorder”64,65 but does not include substance use disorder diagnoses related to other specific psychedelic and dissociative drugs.

Limited research suggests that use of psychedelic drugs, such as psilocybin and LSD, does not typically lead to addiction.1,35 Researchers think that one reason may be because people commonly experience unpleasant side effects when taking these substances, including headaches and nausea, which reduces their desire to take them again.66

A small laboratory study published on psilocybin, DMT, and mescaline suggested that these psychedelic drugs are “weakly reinforcing,” indicating their use is not likely to lead to a substance use disorder.67 However, some evidence suggests people may quickly develop a tolerance to psychedelic drugs, meaning they must keep taking more of the drug to experience the same level of effects.24

While more research is needed, laboratory research and a few human studies suggest that using the dissociative drug ketamine outside of a clinical setting can lead to cravings as well as symptoms of withdrawal.68

NIDA conducts and supports research to better understand how often and to what extent people experience tolerance, withdrawal, and other substance use disorder symptoms related to the use of psychedelic and dissociative drugs.

What is the scope of psychedelic and dissociative drug use in the United States?

Information on the use of psychedelic and dissociative drugs is collected by several national surveys. These surveys use the terms “hallucinogen” and “hallucinogen use disorder” and data from those surveys are reported below.

What are examples of psychedelic and dissociative drugs?

While many emerging and established substances are classified as psychedelic and dissociative drugs, NIDA-supported research mainly focuses on the following substances, which are more commonly used and/or are being investigated as potential medical treatments. While some debate remains on how to describe these drugs and how specific drugs are classified, researchers generally classify them according to how they work in the brain.

Among other health effects, psychedelic drugs alter a person’s perception of their surroundings. They can change a person’s sense of self, their mood, and their perception of reality.1,3,10

Psilocybin is a chemical compound in certain types of mushrooms, also called “shrooms” or “magic mushrooms.”23

LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), or “acid,” is a clear or white, odorless, lab-made (synthetic) substance derived from chemicals in fungi that grow on rye and other grains.69

DMT (N,N-dimethyltryptamine) is a chemical compound found in plants native to the Amazon rainforest. These plants are sometimes used to make a tea called ayahuasca.70 Lab-made (synthetic) DMT is a white crystalline powder that is usually smoked.71

Mescaline is a chemical compound found in peyote, a small cactus native to America’s southwest and northern Mexico. Mescaline can also be lab-made (synthetic).72

NBOMes (N-Benzylphenethylamines) are lab-made (synthetic) chemical compounds originally developed for use in brain research.73 They are sometimes sold as LSD but are more potent with higher risk of adverse effects.

Among other health effects, dissociative drugs can also alter people’s perception of reality. They also typically make people feel as if they are disconnected from their body and environment.6

Ketamine is a chemical compound used in prescription medications for anesthesia in humans and animals. It is also illegally manufactured as a liquid or off-white powder.28 A derivative called esketamine is FDA-approved for treatment-resistant depression.

PCP (phencyclidine) is a synthetic chemical compound most commonly used as a liquid or white crystal powder.40

Researchers are also interested in the psychedelic and dissociative properties of other drugs. These include:

MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine), also called “Molly” or “Ecstasy,” is a lab-made (synthetic) drug that has effects similar to stimulants like methamphetamine. Some researchers and organizations consider MDMA to be a psychedelic drug because it can also mildly alter visual and time perception.7

Ibogaine is a chemical compound that comes from the bark of certain plants. These include the iboga shrub, which is used in religious rites in Western Africa. While ibogaine does have psychedelic properties, it affects a different spectrum of brain activity than psychedelic or dissociative drugs.8

Salvia (salvia divinorum) is a plant common to southern Mexico and Central and South America. Salvia leaves are typically chewed, extracted as juices, smoked, or vaporized. Unlike psychedelic or dissociative drugs, it primarily activates kappa opioid receptors in the brain.21

What is microdosing?

Some people report “microdosing” psychedelic drugs, typically LSD or psilocybin. Microdosing refers to regularly taking these drugs in very small amounts, typically one tenth to one twentieth of a typical non-clinical dose. People report that they microdose to lessen mental health symptoms such as depression and stress, improve productivity, and ease pain. However, research to date has not established that microdosing is safe or effective.22,74

Are psychedelic and dissociative drugs legal?

While laws vary by specific substance, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) lists most psychedelic and dissociative drugs on the U.S. schedule of controlled substances. However, the legal status of some of these drugs is evolving. Though most of these substances remain federally controlled, some states and the District of Columbia have decriminalized possession of psilocybin and some similar drugs (meaning there are no criminal penalties for possessing smaller amounts of the substance for personal use) or deprioritized enforcement of laws against the substances. Other jurisdictions are considering similar changes.75
