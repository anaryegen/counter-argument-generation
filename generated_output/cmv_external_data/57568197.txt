Sport has been identied as a context in which youth encounter positive and

negative experiences. However, relatively little is known about the factors that

lead to positive and negative personal development among sport participants. The

purpose of this study was to investigate the role of enjoyment and motivational

climate on positive and negative personal development of team sport participants.

A sample of 510 athletes between the ages of 9 and 19 completed questionnaires

on positive and negative personal development, enjoyment, and motivational cli-

mate. Stepwise multiple regression analyses examined the effects of enjoyment

and motivational climate on the personal development of the athletes. Results

demonstrated that positive experiences in sport were most strongly predicted by

afliation with peers, self-referenced competency, effort expenditure, and a task

climate. Negative experiences were most strongly predicted by an ego climate and

other-referenced competency. Results suggest that creating an environment that

encourages peer afliation and personal achievement can result in the positive

personal development of youth sport participants.

Sport has been identied as the most popular structured activity for youth par-

ticipation (Mahoney, Larson, Eccles, & Lord, 2005). Recently, Guèvremont, Findlay,

and Kohen (2008) reported that approximately 76% of Canadian youth between

the ages of 6 and 17 years participated in at least one structured sport activity in

the past year. In the United States, it is estimated that approximately 62% of high

school students participated on at least one school or nonschool sport team in the

Personal Development Through Sport 33

previous year (Pate, Trost, Levin, & Dowda, 2000). These data demonstrate that

the majority of North American youth have some experience with organized sport.

Weiss and Williams (2004) summarized the reasons why youth participate in

sport. They suggested that youth participate for reasons of physical competence/

adequacy (i.e., improve skills, achieve goals), social acceptance (i.e., make new

friends, team atmosphere), and enjoyment (i.e., energy release, excitement). These

reasons point to the complexity of youth sport involvement, and demonstrate that

individual (i.e., enjoyment) and environmental (i.e., team atmosphere) factors are

important for understanding participation. Weiss and Williams concluded that par-

ticipation in youth sport can be enhanced by (a) making sure the sport is enjoyable,

(b) creating a task-oriented motivational climate, (c) providing social support, and

(d) helping children help themselves. These recommendations highlight enjoyment

and motivational climate as critical factors for prolonged participation of youth in

sport. The following paragraphs elaborate on the relationship between enjoyment,

motivational climate and youth sport.

Enjoyment is consistently associated with continued sport participation (Scan-

lan, Carpenter, Schmidt, Simons, & Keeler, 1993; Scanlan, Stein, & Ravizza, 1989;

Weiss, Kimmel, & Smith, 2001; Wiersma, 2001). To explain why youth commit to

sport, Scanlan and colleagues (Scanlan et al., 1989; 1993) developed the sport com-

mitment model. They argued that sport commitment is inuenced by ve constructs.

Four of these constructs—enjoyment, personal investment, social constraints, and

involvement opportunities—were positively associated with commitment, while

involvement alternatives were negatively related to sport commitment. Results of

their analyses pointed to enjoyment as the most important component linked to

youth’s commitment to sports. Subsequent work by Weiss et al. (2001) extended

the sport commitment model (Scanlan et al., 1993) by including enjoyment as a

mediating variable rather than a direct predictor of sport commitment. Although

not statistically more predictive than the model developed by Scanlan et al. (1993),

Weiss and colleagues (2001) suggested that enjoyment could be conceived as a

partial mediator in conceptualizing sport commitment. Both models support the

contention that enjoyment plays an important role in youth’s decision to participate

in sport for an extended period of time. What is less clear is how an individual’s

enjoyment levels inuence youth experience in sports.

Motivational climate is another important factor that is known to inuence

participation in sport (Balaguer, Duda, & Crespo, 1999; Duda & Balaguer, 2007;

Smith, Smoll, & Cumming, 2007). Operationalized as either task or ego, motiva-

tional climate reects an individual’s perception of the sport setting. A task climate

is created when the focus is on personal skill development regardless of how others

perform. Conditions where coaches and/or peers encourage athletes to give their

best effort in attaining challenging but realistic goals facilitate a task oriented cli-

mate. Alternatively, an ego climate is formed when the focus is on demonstrating

superior ability over others (Smith et al., 2007). In general, research on motiva-

tional climate suggests that a task climate has a positive effect on athletes while

an ego climate results in negative sport experiences (Duda & Balaguer, 2007). In a

study investigating the effects of a motivational climate intervention with coaches

on athlete anxiety levels, Smith et al. (2007) found that athletes who played for

coaches who received task climate training decreased in anxiety throughout the

season. Athletes who played for coaches who did not receive any training increased

in anxiety as the season progressed. Balaguer et al. (1999) investigated perceptions

of motivational climate on satisfaction and coach ratings in a group of 219 tennis

players and found that task climate was linked to increased perceptions of ability

to use psychological skills, satisfaction with level of play, and match results. Their

results were corroborated by Cumming, Smoll, Smith, and Grossbard (2007) who

found that a task climate was signicantly related to an athlete’s satisfaction with

the coach. Cumming et al. also found that a task climate was related to win-loss

records and enjoyment. Alternatively, perceptions of an ego climate are associated

with negative experiences such as peer conict (Ommundsen, Roberts, Lemyre,

& Miller, 2005), negative perceptions of the coach (Smith, Fry, Ethington, & Li,

2005), and increased anxiety (Pensgaard & Roberts, 2002). Overall, these studies

suggest that a task oriented motivational climate is benecial for sport participation

while an ego climate can reduce participation in youth.

While the above research studies pertaining to enjoyment and motivational

climate are largely framed around sport participation, it has been suggested that

another primary goal of youth sport programs should be personal development

(Côté & Fraser-Thomas, 2007). Authors argue that a properly structured youth

sport program is an ideal setting in which youth can learn valuable skills that can

be applied to other facets of their lives (Fraser-Thomas, Côté, & Deakin, 2005;

Petitpas, Cornelius, Van Raalte, & Jones, 2005). Hansen and colleagues (Hansen

& Larson, 2007; Hansen, Larson, & Dworkin, 2003; Larson, Hansen, & Moneta,

2006) tested this assumption with a series of studies that examined the experiences

of youth in different structured activities (i.e., sports, arts, faith groups, academic

programs, community groups). Hansen et al. (2003) found that sport participants

and faith groups developed higher emotional regulation than academic groups. They

also found that sport participants reported higher rates of negative peer interactions

than faith, academic, and arts groups and that inappropriate adult behaviors were

higher in sports than in faith groups. In another study of 2280 11th grade youth

who participated in the same activities outlined above, Larson et al. (2006) found

that sport participants reported higher rates of goal setting and effort; however

athletes also reported higher levels of the negative experiences of stress and social

exclusion compared with other activities.

A more recent study by Strachan, Côté, and Deakin (2009) assessed positive

and negative personal development between groups of athletes aged 12–16 years

who sample (athletes who participate in multiple sports) or specialize (athletes

heavily invested in only one sport). They found that athletes in the sampling group

reported stronger links to their sport, family, and community, whereas specializers

reported higher rates of diverse peer groups, but also higher rates of physical and

emotional exhaustion. These results demonstrate that participation in sport is related

to a range of positive and negative developmental experiences.

Given that enjoyment and motivational climate are established predictors of

sport participation, they may also be useful in predicting other youth sport outcomes

such as positive and negative personal development. However, these relationships

have yet to be investigated. One possible explanation for the lack of research on this

topic is the shortage of tools available to measure personal development in sport

participants. Until recently, a personal development measure designed specically

for sport participants had yet to be developed. MacDonald, Deakin, Eys, and Côté

(2009) created the Youth Experiences Survey for Sport (YES-S) by modifying the

Personal Development Through Sport 35

more general Youth Experience Survey (YES; Hansen & Larson, 2002; 2005). The

YES-S is a 37-item scale that measures positive and negative personal development

of sport participants on the ve dimensions of personal and social skills, cognitive

skills, goal setting, initiative, and negative experiences. As a result, the purpose of

the current study was to examine the effects of enjoyment and motivational climate

on the personal development of youth sport participants. Hypotheses were that

higher reports of enjoyment and task climate would be associated with positive

personal development experiences and that higher reports of an ego climate would

be associated with greater negative experiences.

The participants in the study were 510 male (47.5%) and female (52.5%) athletes

between the ages of 9 and 19 years (M = 14.88, SD = 1.58). Athletes participated

in school sports or nonelite community programs across the sports of baseball

(9), basketball (68), curling (6), dance (29), football (55), hockey (132), lacrosse

(13), ringette (11), rowing (2), soccer (99), softball (20), synchronized swimming

(10), and volleyball (56). A diverse sample of team sports was used to provide a

wide range of possible experiences. The sample was limited to team sports given

that motivational climate reects individual perceptions of group atmosphere. The

operational denition used in the current study to represent team sports was that

athletes practice and compete as a group.

Youth Experience Survey for Sport. Positive and negative personal development

experiences were assessed using the Youth Experience Survey for Sport (YES-

S; MacDonald et al., 2009). The YES-S was developed from a modied version

of the Youth Experience Survey 2.0 (YES; Hansen & Larson, 2005) in a group

of 637 youth sport participants. The YES-S is a 37-item questionnaire that

measures personal development experiences of youth sport participants on the

ve dimensions of personal and social skills (14 items; i.e., “I became better

at giving feedback”), cognitive skills (5 items; i.e., “this activity increased my

desire to stay in school”), goal setting (4 items; i.e., “I set goals for myself in this

activity”), initiative (4 items; i.e., “I put all my energy into this activity”), and

negative experiences (10 items; i.e., “I got stuck doing more than my fair share”).

Athletes reect on their current or recent sport involvement in a given setting

and respond to each statement using a 4-point Likert-type scale anchored by ‘Not

at all’ to ‘Yes denitely’ as representing experiences that occurred during their

sport involvement. The instrument has shown acceptable psychometric properties

with values of Q = 2.32, CFI = .91, and RMSEA = .06 (MacDonald et al., 2009).

Reliability analyses of the subscales in the current study produced Cronbach alpha

values between .79 and .90.

Sources of Enjoyment in Youth Sport Questionnaire. The second measure used

was the Sources of Enjoyment in Youth Sport Questionnaire (SEYSQ; Wiersma,

2001). The SEYSQ is a 28-item scale that measures enjoyment on the six

dimensions of self-referenced competency (4 items; i.e., “playing well compared

to how I’ve played in the past”), other-referenced competency and recognition (6

items; i.e., “being better in my sport than other athletes my age or in my league”),

effort expenditure (5 items; i.e., “playing hard during competition”), competitive

excitement (4 items; i.e., “the excitement of competition”), afliation with peers

(5 items; i.e., “being with friends on my team”), and positive parental involvement

(4 items; i.e., “getting support from my parent(s) for playing my sport”). Each

statement is preceded by the stem “During the times when I most enjoy sport, I

usually experience that enjoyment from . . .”. Responses on the SEYSQ are given

using a 5-point Likert-type scale that ranges from ‘Not at all’ to ‘Very much’. The

six-factor structure of the SEYSQ has been validated by Wiersma (2001) with a

sample of 896 young athletes between the ages of 12 and 18 years. Results of the

conrmatory factor analysis demonstrated good t parameters with a RMSEA =

.05 and a CFI = .97. Reliability analyses demonstrated acceptable values ranging

between .65 and .85. In the current study, reliability coefcients for the different

subscales of the SEYSQ were between .74 and .84.

Motivational Climate Scale for Youth Sport. The nal measure used was the

Motivational Climate Scale for Youth Sport (MCSYS; Smith, Cumming, & Smoll,

2008). The instrument was developed with 992 young athletes between the ages

of 9 and 16 years and measures two dimensions of motivational climate (task and

ego) present in the youth sport domain. The two factor model tested by Smith et

al. (2008) demonstrated strong psychometric properties with values of Q = 1.52,

CFI = .97, GFI = .97, and RMSEA = .04. Specically, the MCSYS asks athletes to

rate 12 statements related to the sport climate on a 1 (Not at all true) to 5 (Very true)

Likert-type scale. Six statements are linked to a task climate while six are related

to an ego climate. In the current study, task and ego subscales showed reliability

coefcients of .82 and .79 respectively.

Data were collected from community sport programs and high schools located

in the province of Ontario, Canada. Following university ethics approval, sport

programs and high schools were contacted for participation in the study. When a

school or program agreed to participate, arrangements were made to secure a time

during which data collection could occur.

For the athletes in the schools, data collection occurred during a designated

class time. Before data collection, letters of information and consent were sent

home with students. A research assistant then proceeded with the data collection

phase with students who agreed to participate. Athletes were given the opportunity

to withdraw from the study on the day of data collection if they did not want to

participate. The students who agreed to participate were given instructions about

the purpose of the study and asked to ll out each questionnaire with their primary

sport in mind. These instructions allowed athlete’s to choose the sport in which they

were most involved and reect on the experiences that occurred in that environment.

Any questions that came up during data collection were addressed immediately.

All questionnaires were completed during the designated time and collected by the

Personal Development Through Sport 37

research assistant. The time needed for participants to complete the questionnaires

was approximately 30–40 min.

Once sport teams agreed to participate, a meeting time was arranged to explain

the purpose of the study and provide athletes the opportunity to complete the

questionnaires. This meeting typically occurred at the end of a practice or game.

During this meeting, the purpose was explained and appropriate documentation

was provided to the participants. Participation was voluntary and athletes could

withdraw at any moment without consequence. A copy of each questionnaire, letter

of information, and consent/assent forms were distributed to athletes who agreed

to participate. Each participant was encouraged to complete the questionnaires on

location however some could not commit the 30–40 min required to complete the

forms and completed the questionnaires at home. When athletes completed the

questionnaire at home, the primary researcher returned after a subsequent practice

or game to collect the completed documents. Athletes returned the completed ques-

tionnaires to the primary researcher in a sealed envelope. Only a small number of

athletes were unable to commit the time required to complete the questionnaires

and chose to not participate in the study.

Data were entered into a spreadsheet and cleaned to contain only valid cases. In

some instances participants did not complete all the questionnaires; these individuals

were subsequently removed from the analysis due to large amounts of missing data.

For other missing data, a pairwise deletion method was employed. This method

removes individual cases in the variable of interest. A research assistant double

checked the data for entry errors. With incomplete cases removed, normality and

homoscedasticity were assessed across variables of interest. No variables had to

be recoded due to nonnormal or heteroscedastic patterns.

Stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to assess the relationships

between subscales of the SEYSQ and MCSYS on personal development as outlined

by the YES-S. Stepwise regression was selected over other approaches because the

relationships between experiences, enjoyment, and motivational climate have yet

to be established. Therefore, a method which builds a model was preferred over

a method that tests a model (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007). Five separate models

using each subscale of the YES-S as the dependent variable tested the relationships.

Mean and standard deviation values for each subscale with corresponding reliabil-

ity coefcients are presented in Table 1. Mean values of the YES-S demonstrate

that youth experiences were quite positive but that athletes also faced negative

experiences. The climate in which these activities took place were mainly task

oriented and athletes reported high levels of enjoyment on all subscales. Reliability

analyses of the YES-S, MCSYS and SEYSQ showed acceptable values for each

of the subscales. Inspection of correlations between subscales of the SEYSQ and

MCSYS showed low to moderate relationships with Pearson coefcients between

-.30 and .63 (Table 2).

The personal development of athletes was investigated using stepwise multiple

regressions. Five models, using each subscale of the YES-S as a dependent variable,

were tested with two subscales of the MCSYS and six subscales of the SEYSQ as

independent variables to determine which predicted positive and negative personal

development. Results of the models are presented in Table 3.

Personal and Social Skills

Five variables signicantly predicted personal and social skills. The strongest predic-

tor, which explained approximately 27% of the variance, was afliation with peers.

The variables of effort expenditure, task climate, competitive excitement, and ego

climate also predicted personal and social skills and accounted for an additional

10% of the variance. The relationship between the predictors and dependent vari-

able were positive meaning that high scores on these scales led to higher reports

of personal and social skills.

Three variables signicantly contributed to the explanation of cognitive skill devel-

opment and accounted for approximately 14% of the variance. Other-referenced

competency was the strongest predictor and accounted for approximately 9% of the

variance in cognitive skills. Conceptualized as comparing one’s ability to others,

Personal Development Through Sport 41

this result suggests that comparison between athletes is benecial to the develop-

ment of cognitive skills. Similarly, the construct of self-referenced competency,

which is manifested through an individual’s attainment of personal performance

goals, was negatively related to the development of cognitive skills. Finally, high

effort expenditure was positively related to the development of cognitive skills.

Approximately 27% of the variability in goal setting was explained by four variables.

Self-referenced competency, afliation with peers, task climate, and effort expen-

diture were found to be positively related to goal setting behaviors. Self-referenced

competency and task climate are complimentary concepts and deal with reaching

one’s potential by achieving personal performance benchmarks. Afliation with

peers and effort expenditure are two constructs that relate to goal setting. Team

sport participants need to function as a unit and invest similar amounts of effort to

reach their goals. The results of this model suggest that high levels of connected-

ness with peers and higher effort during an activity leads to more opportunities

Four variables (competitive excitement, effort expenditure, task climate, and self-

referenced competency) combined to explain approximately 29% of the variance

in initiative. Experiencing enjoyment from upcoming competitions explained the

most variance in initiative with 22%. Similar to goal setting, effort expenditure,

a task climate, and self-referenced competency combined to explain part of the

variability in initiative.

Negative Experiences

Four variables predicted 16% of the variance in negative experiences. The strongest

predictor of negative experiences was an ego climate. This result suggests that cli-

mates which place emphasis on evaluating ability based on outperforming others

(i.e., winning) promote negative experiences in young athletes. Related to an ego

climate, results indicate that having high scores on other-referenced competency

also predict negative experiences. Considering that both these constructs are similar

in nature, this result was not entirely surprising. Athletes who reported high levels

of self-referenced competency showed lower rates of negative experiences.

Across the positive domains of the YES-S, results identied afliation with peers,

effort expenditure, self-referenced competency, and task climate as the important

predictors of personal development in youth sport participants. This supports the

rst hypothesis of this study by linking high rates of enjoyment and a task climate

to positive personal development. Conversely an ego climate was found to be the

strongest predictor of negative personal development, which supports the second

hypothesis of the study.

Positive Personal Development

The strongest predictor of personal and social skills was afliation with peers.

This suggests that creating opportunities for positive peer interactions in the sport

domain is benecial for the development of personal and social skills. This nd-

ing adds to our understanding of peer relationships in sport by demonstrating that

positive relationships with peers are not only important for participation purposes

(Smith, 2007; Weiss & Williams, 2004) but can also lead to positive personal

development in youth.

The benet of establishing positive and strong relationships with peers may

well be responsible for the nding of task and ego climates as positive contributors

to the development of personal and social skills. This nding differs from previous

work (Cumming et al. 2007; Duda & Balaguer 2007) that links task climates with

positive emotional and cognitive development in athletes and ego climates with

negative development (for a review, see Duda & Balaguer, 2007). Results also

suggest that peer relationships within the sport setting play a larger role (Holt,

Black, Tamminen, Fox, & Mandigo, 2008) than the perceived climate, which would

explain why personal and social skills developed across both task and ego climates.

However, further investigations of the relationship between afliation with peers

and motivational climates are necessary to substantiate this claim.

Eccles and Barber (1999) linked sport participation with increased grade-

point average and subsequent college enrolment. The relationship between sport

and school success suggests that processes within the sport environment help

athletes develop cognitive abilities. The present study found that other-referenced

competency and effort expenditure were positively related to cognitive skills while

self-referenced competency was negatively related. These ndings imply that com-

parison with others and effort relates to greater cognitive skill development than

other aspects of enjoyment and motivational climate. Although it is unclear why

this is the case, it is possible that other-referenced competency and effort serve as

moderating variables between participation in sport and a child’s cognitive develop-

ment. In addition, it is unclear if the ndings of this study would be supported for

youth who participate in different structured activities such as arts or faith-based

programs. It would be worthwhile for future studies to examine the relationship

between comparisons to others and cognitive development across different domains

to further understand the role of structured activities on cognitive development.

Approximately 25% of the variance in goal setting was explained by positive

reports of self-referenced competency, afliation with peers, and task climate. It

is believed that the predictors of goal setting identied in this study reect how

athletes use individual and team goals in the sport environment (Dawson, Bray, &

Widmeyer, 2002). Individual goals reect self-referenced competency and can be

used to set personal standards of performance or desired outcomes of sport participa-

tion (Burton & Weiss, 2008). Team goals, which are related to afliation with peers,

are important for team success (Prapavessis, Carron, & Spink, 1996) and should be

used by coaches and teams to set performance standards. The present results suggest

that goal setting behaviors can be enhanced by creating a task-oriented environ-

ment that stresses positive afliation with peers and self-referenced competency.

Applications of goal setting behaviors in youth sport programs were related

to the personal development of children. Danish and colleagues (Danish, Forneris,

Personal Development Through Sport 43

Hodge, & Heke, 2004; Danish, Forneris, & Wallace, 2005) developed Sports United

to Promote Education and Recreation (SUPER; see Danish, Fazio, Nellen, & Owen,

2002); a program which teaches youth sport participants a number of life skills

within the sport setting by providing workshops to participants. Of the 18 workshops

that makeup the SUPER program, seven deal with goal setting and discuss how

goals are created/reached in sport and in other aspects of life (Danish et al., 2005).

Brunelle, Danish, and Forneris (2007) assessed the impact of the SUPER program

on adolescent development and found that the program had a positive effect on

youth’s prosocial behavior and social responsibility. Although the impact of goal

setting modules was not teased out, their results support the ndings of this study

and identify goal setting as a component of personal development.

Competitive excitement, effort expenditure, task climate, and self-referenced

competency were positively related to the construct of initiative. This demonstrates

that initiative can be developed in sport by creating an environment that promotes

excitement, effort expenditure, and self-referenced competency within a task cli-

mate. Coaches and sport programs interested in the development of initiative in

youth should consider these factors if they want to create an environment consistent

with principles of positive youth development through sport. Larson (2000) argues

that youth will develop initiative if they are intrinsically motivated, invest high

amount of effort in the activity, and participate over time. The strongest predictor

of initiative, which is competitive excitement, shares similarities with intrinsic

motivation. Scanlan and Lewthwaite (1986) argue that enjoyment and intrinsic

motivation are related and require athletes to develop positive perceptions of com-

petence before an activity is deemed enjoyable and intrinsically motivating. Given

the connection between enjoyment and intrinsic motivation, the present results

suggest that increased enjoyment may have a role in the development of initiative.

Another predictor of initiative is effort expenditure. This construct reects Lar-

son’s (2000) notion of investing high amounts of energy in the activity. Given that

athletes typically participate in sport for an extended period of time (i.e., at least

one season), the current predictive model supports the three conditions identied

by Larson (2000) for the development of initiative.

Negative Personal Development

The strongest predictors of negative personal development were an ego climate and

other-referenced competency. This result suggests that focusing one’s attention on

comparison with others rather than personal achievement will increase negative

experiences in the sport domain. The link between ego climates and negative sport

experiences is well documented (Balaguer et al., 1999; Cumming et al., 2007; Smith

et al., 2008; Vazou, Ntoumanis, & Duda, 2006) and implies that an environment

emphasizing comparisons with others leads to higher rates of negative experiences.

Although an ego climate was found to be a positive predictor of personal and social

skill development, it is recommended that ego climates be implemented with caution

as results point to negative experiences as an additional outcome of ego climates.

In contrast, self-referenced competency was negatively related to negative experi-

ences meaning that environments which focus on mastery of skills and personal

achievement can reduce negative experiences in youth.

Summary and Conclusion

The results of this study are important for understanding the positive and negative

personal development of young athletes; however limitations exist. The relation-

ships were found in team sport athletes and may not necessarily reect the personal

development of individual sport athletes. For example, it is possible that afliation

with peers is not a signicant predictor of goal setting in individual sports. Future

research is needed to understand how motivational climate and enjoyment affect

personal development across individual and team sports. A second limitation is

that total weekly involvement in sport programs was not taken into account. It

is possible that differences exist between athletes who invest more time in their

program compared with athletes who spend less time. Analyses of how much time

spent in the sport affects personal development is an interesting avenue of future

investigation. A third limitation deals with the age of the participants in the sample.

Although a wide age range was collected, it is unclear if athletes of different ages

had differing personal development experiences. Investigations of how personal

development differs across athletes of different ages would be important to inves-

tigate in future studies. Finally, due to a lack of statistical power, the analyses used

in this study did not account for individuals being nested within teams. Future

studies that collect data from teams should collect a sufciently large sample size

to use multilevel modeling techniques and account for individual and program level

variables (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007).

The ndings of the current study identify afliation with peers, effort expendi-

ture, self-referenced competency, and task climate as the most important predictors

of personal development in young athletes. Research on motivational climate and

enjoyment has linked these constructs to sport participation (Duda & Balaguer,

2007; Weiss & Williams, 2004); however their impact on the personal development

of youth was unknown. The ndings strengthen the understanding of how personal

development can be increased within the youth sport domain and suggest that sport

programs and coaches who wish to increase the personal development of athletes

consider these factors and incorporate them into their sport environment. This can

be achieved by fostering an environment of personal success by promoting the use

of personal achievement goals within the sport setting. Creating an environment

that focuses on the child reects the factors of task climate and self-referenced

competency. In addition, if athletes are encouraged to share their goals with others

and support each other in achieving them, stronger peer relationships and increased

motivation to participate may ensue, which are important factors identied as

predictors of the personal development of young athletes.

A Systematic Review with a Meta-Analysis of the Motivational Climate and Hedonic Well-Being A Systematic Review with a Meta-Analysis of the Motivational Climate and Hedonic Well-Being Constructs: The Importance of the Athlete Level

Motivational climate is known to relate to individual behaviors, emotions, and thoughts. Hedonic or subjective well-being includes self-assessed positive affect (i.e., pleasant affect, moods, and emotions), negative affect (i.e., unpleasant affect, moods, and emotions), and life or domain-specific satisfaction. The aim of this review was to quantify the relationships between task and ego motivational climate scales and measures representing hedonic well-being with sports participants. Potential moderators of the motivational climate and hedonic well-being were examined. This review followed the PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO ID CRD42023470462, registered 28 October 2023). From five relevant databases, one relevant review, and hand searching, 82 articles totaling 26,378 participants (46.3% female) met the inclusion criteria. The articles spanned publication dates from 1993 to 2023, representing 18 countries, various team and individual sports, and athletes competing in elite (e.g., Olympic) to grassroot (e.g., club sport) competitions. To meta-analyze the motivational climate and hedonic well-being relationships, the random-effects model was used. For the moderation analyses, the mixed-effects model was used. The task or mastery climate relationships were medium in magnitude with positive affect and satisfaction and small with negative affect. The ego or performance climate relationships were small in magnitude for positive affect, negative affect, and satisfaction. Evidence of bias existed in the motivational climate and hedonic well-being relationships. For moderation analyses, athlete level (i.e., elite vs. non-elite) moderated (p < 0.05) the task (elite, r = 0.23; non-elite, r = 0.34) and ego motivational climate (elite, r = −0.02; non-elite, r = −0.13) and positive affect and satisfaction combined relationships. In conclusion, the motivational climate and hedonic well-being relationships were stronger for the task climate than for the ego climate. The finding that elite athlete correlations appeared dampened is important for future research. Even with the damped relationships, practitioners, from the Olympics to local clubs, should ensure the promotion of the task climate to maximize positive affect and satisfactions in and around the sport experience.

... Motivational climate refers to the degree that behaviours related to skill development (task/ mastery climates) and/or winning are emphasized (ego/performance climates) [15]. The evidence suggests that when sport is structured in a manner that emphasizes skill development and mastery, experiences tend to be viewed as more meaningful [25,

26]. On the other hand, sport settings can often emphasize competition or comparisons with others (as opposed to personal development), and have been found to be strong predictor of negative sport experiences [15,[26][27][28][29]. ...

[26][27][28][29]. ...

... The importance that participants placed on having opportunities to develop their sport skills and observe progress also aligns with existing research that has investigated motivational climates. Specifically, participants did not identify winning or competition (i.e., ego/performance climates) as critical aspects of a quality sport experience, but rather, task/mastery climates were viewed favourably for facilitating meaningful experiences [25]

[26][27][28][29]. Overall, this study represents the first comprehensive investigation of salient factors impacting youth sport experiences and capturing multiple viewpoints permitted deeper insight into specific aspects of sport that need to be measured in order to determine whether quality sport experiences are an underlying mechanism by which sport may contribute to positive youth development. ...

Towards the development of a quality youth sport experience measure: Understanding participant and stakeholder perspectives

Quality sport experiences may be a key underlying mechanism through which continued sport participation may facilitate positive youth development. However, what constitutes a quality sport experience for youth is poorly understood due to a lack of comprehensiveness among existing measures. This study aimed to identify the salient factors that constitute quality sport experience for youth by capturing athletes and stakeholder perspectives with a broader goal of developing a more robust quality sport experiences measure. A total of 53 youth athletes and stakeholders (i.e., parents, coaches, and sport administrators) completed semi-structured interviews or focus groups about what they felt were important aspects of a quality sport experience for youth. Inductive content analysis of the data identified four themes representing important indicators for a quality sport experience for youth: fun and enjoyment, opportunity for sport skill development and progress, social support and sense of belonging, and open and effective communication. These higher order themes were found among each of the groups that have important interpersonal relationships with athletes, as well as among athletes themselves. Each of these themes were also related to one another. Collectively, findings outline a framework to understand what constitutes a quality sport experience for youth. The Quality Sport Experience Framework for Youth will help in the development of a quantitative tool to assess this construct and enable researchers to examine how these experiences contribute to continued engagement in sport and positive developmental outcomes among youth sport participants.

... Different factors may be related to young people's satisfaction with sports practice, due to the many changes that mark adolescent athletes' development in physical-motor, psychological, and emotional realms and in the dynamic contextual factors of family, work, and community. Past studies have strongly suggested that satisfaction is important for young people to remain engaged in sport activity (Gardner et al., 2017;Lima et al., 2020;

MacDonald et al., 2011;McCarthy et al., 2008;Santos & Gonçalves, 2012). While factors that may explain changes in young athletes' perceived satisfaction in sport remain unclear, despite past research interest, understanding changes in sources of satisfaction through young athletes' development is important for promoting their lifelong engagement in sport practice (McCarthy et al., 2013). ...

... Engaging in an activity that one enjoys distinctively marks the person's emotional experience (Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 2007) and motivates persistent sport participation

(MacDonald et al., 2011;McCarthy et al., 2008;Scanlan et al., 1993;Wiersma, 2001). According to Scanlan et al. (1993, p. 275-276) satisfaction in sport is a "positive affective response to the sport experience that reflects generalized feelings, such as pleasure, liking, and fun." ...

... Factors associated with perceived sources of satisfaction in sports include competencies perceived by others that yield recognition, effort expenditure, positive parental involvement, self-referenced competency, and peer affiliation (Santos & Gonçalves, 2012;Wiersma, 2001). In general, studies have associated these factors with antagonistic extremes; satisfaction in sport has been positively associated with continuity and negatively associated with quitting sports practice (Gardner et al., 2017;

MacDonald et al., 2011;Sanchez-Miguel et al., 2013;Teixeira et al., 2019). Furthermore, the sources of satisfaction change over time, and the motivation for sports practice is influenced by gender, age, types of sports, and context of sports practice (Haas et al., 2021;Lima et al., 2020;McCarthy et al., 2008;Santos & Gonçalves, 2015;Soares et al., 2020;Zanatta et al., 2018). ...

Sources of Sport Satisfaction and Perceived Self-Efficacy Among Youth in a Competitive Environment

Carlos E. Gonçalves

Young people's sources of satisfaction in sport are an important indicator of their long-term sport participation. Contextual factors and an individual's internal dispositions act synergistically to determine a positive experience. We studied sources of sport satisfaction and perceived self-efficacy of 1,151 male and female youth athletes (M age = 14.72, SD = 1.56 years) in Brazil who were engaged in school state level competition. The participants responded to questionnaires on their sport satisfaction and perceived self-efficacy. We considered sex, training time, and last game results as independent variables in accessing participant differences in perceived satisfaction. We observed an increasing trend toward more significant satisfaction as sport experience increased. Perceived self-efficacy was a moderator for young participants' self-reported positive experience in sports. Thus, in our offer of evidence on sources of satisfaction in sport and perceived self-efficacy among youth in competition, we found the extent of the sport experience and self-efficacy to be important factors in the developmental pathway.

... Internationale studier har peget på flere centrale og indbyrdes relaterede faktorer, der har betydning for unges tilknytning til sport i foreninger. De centrale faktorer vedrører blandt andet det at udvikle sig inden for sporten, mødes med venner, det at føle sig som en del af noget større og at have det sjovt (Bratko et al., 2020;Egli et al., 2011;Jakobsson et al., 2014;Kilpatrick et al., 2005;

MacDonald et al., 2011;Moradi et al., 2020;Skille et al., 2011). Omdrejningspunktet for dette studie er de unges oplevelse af sjov, som har vist sig at vaere central for de unges deltagelse i og tilknytning til foreningssport (Hopple, 2015;Jakobsson et al., 2014;Jensen;Kissmeyer, 2009;MacPhail et al., 2008). ...

Hvad er sjov?: En interviewundersøgelse blandt unge svømmere og håndboldspillere i dansk foreningssport

Lotte Nygaard Andersen

Nicoline Zachariassen Jepsen

I et eksplorativt interviewstudie undersøgte vi, hvad der har betydning for unges oplevelse af sjov inden for foreningssport samt eventuelle forskelle og ligheder inden for individuel sport og holdsport. Undersøgelsen viste, at fællesskabet, stemningen, relationer, følelsen af at kende og acceptere hinanden samt vejret påvirker oplevelsen af sjov. De unge oplever, det er sjovt, når de bliver kompetente, er vedholdende og har foreningstilhørsforhold. Træneren er en nøgleperson. Variation i træningen og præmier kan facilitere sjove oplevelser, og præmierne vil minde de unge om oplevelserne. Inden for holdsport fremhæves samarbejde, mens finjustering og at være nysgerrig fremhæves inden for individuel sport.

... The benefits of the motivational environment that sports coaches create together with peers from the team are reflected in the fact that athletes enjoy sports activities more, achieve a better connection with sports coaches and achieve enviable results (Cumming et al., 2007;

MacDonald et al., 2011;Weiss et al., 2009). Sports coaches who are more oriented towards creating a motivational environment help athletes to start their internal motivation, to express their competences with more confidence, especially in sports and encourage them to invest more effort (Weiss, et al., 2009;Vazou et al. , 2006;Halliburton & Weiss, 2002). ...

Guidelines for working with deaf athletes

The work was created with the desire to familiarize experts from the world of sports with the phenomenon of deafness and the culture that has developed within it. Sports occupy a special place in the Deaf community and culture. For this reason, the importance of sports activities for the deaf was emphasized and attention was focused on the contribution of the deaf in the world of sports, which developed within the phenomenon of deafness. The social role of sport and its importance in the implementation of social inclusion were especially emphasized. The aim of the work is to analyze the available literature in the period from 2000-2022 to determine how developed the inclusive perspective of sports is in the context of social change, such as acculturation, and to offer concrete guidelines that would facilitate familiarity and, therefore, acceptance of the peculiarities and values of Deaf culture. The following search engines were used for the literature search: Ebscohost, ScienceDirect, Wiley Inter Science and SpringerLink, KoBSON, Google Scholar. The results obtained from the review of the literature indicate the importance of the role of sports coaches in creating a stimulating climate, as well as that sports provide great opportunities in leveling the differences that place deafness and Deaf culture in the context of handicaps. Specific guidelines are listed and described, which not only serve to introduce sports experts to the deaf, but also to enrich the work in the world of sports, which also leads to the essential realization of social inclusion.

An Examination of the Sport Commitment Model for Athletes With Physical Disabilities

Sport commitment describes a psychological attachment to a sport that influences one’s desire or resolve to continue involvement in it. Studying antecedents believed to influence long term commitment to sport among athletes with a disability will help ensure that participants gain those psychosocial and health outcomes from sport participation that benefit quality of life. Our purposes in this study were: (i) to examine the Sport Commitment Model (SCM) in terms of the magnitude of the contribution of antecedent factors (i.e., enjoyment, personal investment, involvement opportunities, social constraints, involvement alternatives) to sport commitment of athletes with disabilities; and (ii) to examine the model structure (i.e., original SCM, mediation, and direct/indirect model) that best reflects an understanding of the sport commitment antecedents for these athletes. A total of 157 adult athletes ( M age = 34.87, SD = 11.78) with physical disabilities from both team and individual sports across the United States, Europe, and Asia completed the Sport Commitment Questionnaire. Data analyses indicated that sport involvement opportunities, followed by personal investment, were the strongest predictors of these athletes’ sport commitments (R ² = .66). Based on the principle of parsimony, the original structural equation model (χ ² (215) = 384.95; RMSEA = .07; CFI = .95; SRMR = .06) was deemed better for understanding the mechanism of sport commitment than the mediation or direct/indirect models. We address implications of applying the SCM to athletes with disabilities, and we offer suggestions for future research.

Research on the Relationship Between Ski and Snowboard Athletes’ Fear of Failure and Their Sport Enjoyment and Goal Orientation

Enjoying sport is a critical factor in understanding the sources of athletes’ enthusiasm for sport, creating enjoyable sport experiences for young athletes, maintaining their participation in sport, and setting specific goals. It is well known that fear of failure is amongst the main motivational problems on the path to achieving set goals. The inability to eliminate the fear of failure can lead to a decline in the level of fulfilment, satisfaction, and pleasure, interfering with the achievement of goals set by the athlete for a specific purpose. From this point of view, the aim of our study is to examine the effects of ski and snowboard athletes’ enjoyment of sport and goal orientation on their fear of failure in terms of various variables. This study is quantitative research in which the correlational survey model was applied. The Sources of Sports Enjoyment Scale (SSEE) adapted to Turkish by Çimen and Gürbüz (2008), the Task and Ego Orientation Scale (TEOS) adapted to Turkish by Toros (2004), and The Performance Failure Appraisal Inventory translated into Turkish by Kahraman and Sungur (2016) were used. The population of the study consists of ski and snowboard athletes in Turkey, while the sample group consists of a total of 124 ski and snowboard athletes 72 of whom are male and 25 of whom are female randomly selected from various ski clubs. Significant differences were found in all sub-scales of the participants’ gender variable and sports failure scale, and in both sub-scales of participation level variable and goal orientation. Positive moderate linear relationships were observed between sources of goal orientation, ego orientation and enjoyment of sport, and between ego orientation and goal orientation. Regarding the Failure in Sports scale, the female participants who regularly attended the trainings had, on average, higher scores on the "Participation Level" variable and the "Goal Orientation" scale. As the sources of sports enjoyment increase, goal orientation and ego orientation also increase. As ego orientation increases, goal orientation also increases.Keywords: Fear of Failure, Goal Orientation, Sports, Enjoyment

“Having our say”: a micro-level perspective in understanding sports clubs’ membership and active participation

Purpose This study aims to examine the drivers of membership at the micro-level to influence club retention rates and promote positive health-related behaviours through encouraging active member participation. Design/methodology/approach The data for this study ( n = 197) was obtained from four martial arts groups in Melbourne, Australia. Self-administered questionnaires assessed the importance of personal benefits, risk taking, personal values and enjoyment of specific benefits. Findings Hierarchical analysis identified shared values, excitement ( ß = −0.066, p < 0.05), sense of belonging ( ß = 0.644, p < 0.05), enjoyment of activities ( ß = 0.179, p < 0.05), fitness level ( ß = 0.564, p < 0.05), belt status ( ß = 0.466 p < 0.05) and the expectations of instructor ( ß = 0.144 p < 0.05) and others ( ß = 0.483 p < 0.05) as predictors in attracting and retaining club membership. Adult Australians share socio-demographic characteristics and common desires to attain specific benefits which appear to evolve, as membership is not perceived as an interim engagement but rather as a lifelong lifestyle choice. Practical implications By advocating positive associations between lifetime membership and active participation, social marketing campaigns can inform and contribute towards a knowledge base for sports clubs to develop targeted strategies and practices towards membership retention. Originality/value This study contributes to evidence-based social marketing approaches in an era of ageing demographics, where there remains a need to learn more about how to manage active memberships to promote healthy lifestyles and well-being at a national, community and individual level. The approach of exploring club membership at micro-level to inform tailored macro-level strategic health-related messages is also novel.

Team building in sport

The purpose of the study was to examine the influence of a psychological intervention program focusing on team-building principles on the cohesion in soccer teams. Perceptions of cohesion of athletes in team-building, control, and attention-placebo control conditions were assessed prior to the beginning of the season and then after an eight-week intervention period. Assessment of athletes' satisfaction with both personal and team performance as well as the monitoring of coaching behavior showed the treatment conditions were comparable on these variables. Results showed that the team-building intervention was not successful in enhancing perceptions of cohesiveness. A post-manipulation check of athletes' awareness of the team building components provided support for a number of possible explanations. Implications for future research are discussed.

“Specializers” Versus “Samplers” in Youth Sport: Comparing Experiences and Outcomes

The purpose of the current study was to examine two different trajectories of sport participation and explore any similarities or differences that may result regarding personal development and sport outcomes. Seventy-four youth athletes (40 "specializes" and 34 "samplers") were recruited for the current study and four measures were employed to assess sport experiences and outcomes. Discriminant function analyses revealed no differences between groups in asset possession or sources of enjoyment however, differences were reported in sport experiences and burnout. The"samplers" reported more experiences regarding the integration of sport and family as well as linkages to the community. Although the "specializers" reported higher levels of physical/emotional exhaustion than did the "samplers, " they also reported more experiences related to diverse peer groups. The differences highlight the importance of examining specific pathways of development in sport to gain a deeper understanding of youths' experiences in sport.

We examined the potential benefits and risks associated with participation in five types of activities: prosocial (church and volunteer activities), team sports, school involvement, performing arts, and academic clubs. Our sample included 1,259 mostly European American adolescents (approximately equal numbers of males and females). First, we explore the link between involvement in these activities and our indicators of positive and negative development. Involvement in prosocial activities was linked to positive educational trajectories and low rates of involvement in risky behaviors. In contrast, participation in team sports was linked to positive educational trajectories and to high rates of involvement in one risky behavior, drinking alcohol. Then, we explore two possible mediators of these associations: peer associations and activity-based identity formation. The evidence supported our hypothesis that group differences in peer associations and activity-based identities help explain activity group differences.

The role of approach‐avoidance versus task and ego goals in enjoyment and cognitive anxiety in youth...

February 2011 · International Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology

This study investigated whether approach‐avoidance goals predicted enjoyment, concentration disruption, and worry, and compared approach‐avoidance versus task/ego goals in predicting these variables. British youth athletes (139 males, 110 females, 5 did not report gender), with a mean age of 13.57 (SD = 1.69) years and a mean sport experience of 4.81 (SD = 2.80) years, completed questionnaires ... [Show full abstract] measuring approach‐avoidance and task/ego goals, enjoyment, concentration disruption, worry, and perceived competence. Mastery‐approach goals positively predicted enjoyment, and negatively predicted concentration disruption and worry. The two avoidance goals positively predicted concentration disruption and worry, while performance‐approach goals did not predict any outcome variable. In hierarchical regression analyses, task/ego goals were the most important predictors of enjoyment, whereas approach‐avoidance goals were the most important predictors of concentration disruption and worry. Both sets of goals accounted for unique variance in the variables examined, suggesting the approach‐avoidance distinction is a valuable addition to achievement goal theoryRead more
