Religion as a Force for Social Cohesion and well-being: Establishing a Correlation Between Religion and Societal Health.

These days the prevalent view in secular society is that religion is the cause of societal dysfunction. Religion, for many, is a source of conflict on various levels; social, economic, and political. Throughout world history, humanity has suffered greatly in the name of nationality and religion. There is a negative connotation with religion, because crusades, jihad, holy wars, or violence are part of religious history. In order to understand the impact of religion on a society — beneficial or non-beneficial — should be analyzed through a sociological context. Religious life is multidimensional and consists of many aspects; therefore, it is crucial to examine the following facets associated with religion, such as social cohesion and philanthropic benefits. Focusing on these two aspects will help establish a correlation between religion and societal health.

According to the definition, social cohesion is a state of cohering or uniting people together. Religion gives people the opportunity to share common values, create a sense of unity and foster a sense of community. Religious rituals, traditions, and customs are not meaningless, but they contribute to social cohesion. Celebrating Christmas, fasting for the month of Ramadan, and celebrating Diwali bring unity and togetherness to society. Religious diversity is not always a source of conflict or societal dysfunction, but it enriches our life by discovering unity within diverse religious communities. Religious institutions serve a greater purpose for the betterment of humanity.

Many faith communities encourage altruistic values such as compassion, kindness, and mercy for the greater good of humanity. Common goals and adherence to altruistic values help them collaborate with one another in constructing a healthy social environment. For example, Focus Hope is an organization based in Detroit. The objective of this organization is to eradicate racism and provide education and training to minority groups. Faith-Based Organizations (FBOs) are playing a critical role in building communities, encouraging social justice and equality, promoting interfaith dialogue, and providing aid in a humanitarian crisis.

Active involvement of religious institutions in creating a social environment contributes to societal health. Besides promoting coherence in a society, the primary concern of religious institutions is the spiritual evolution of humanity. The main goal of religious and philosophical awareness that is highly encouraged throughout world religion is to inspire humanity to become a responsible and beneficial members of society. Moral philosophy emphasized by religious institutions establishes a sense of responsibility that transcends beyond personal to social responsibility.

Religious institutions enthusiastically promote philanthropic activities and altruistic values by offering services to the elderly, organizing events to collect funds, and providing assistance to those who are in need. For example, philanthropic organizations –local or international- such as Red Cross, Erie Peace Initiative, Focus Hope, and Wisdom work in partnership with other organizations in order to form a social network, encourage interfaith interreligious dialogues, and build bridges for future collaboration. A research paper conducted by Anjali Pant, Thomas D. Kirsch, and R. Subbarao for the Johns Hopkins Department of Emergency Medicine, in Baltimore, Maryland, states

“Faith-based organizations (FBOs) are recognized in the US as important partners in social programs across the country, and, since January 2001, have been supported by the federal government through the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives” (Kirsch, pant, and R. Subbarao 48–54).

Ultimately, focusing on social cohesion and philanthropic benefits associated with religious institutions helps us establish that there is a correlation between religion and societal health.

To some religion may be a source of conflict, chaos, violence, and destruction, but this limited view is due to the multidimensional aspects of religious life. Religion is considered to be a destructive force rather than a constructive positive force in society due to intolerance, injustice, and social conflict in the name of religion. Conflicts based on religious differences arise in a form of social dysfunction when followers of a certain creed are unable to comprehend the spirit of religion. The inability to grasp the essence of religious teachings leads to clashes on a personal and social level. Secondly, neglecting the altruistic qualities, and spiritual and psychological transformation that religion demands, gives rise to prejudice, hatred, religious intolerance, violence, and oppression. History is full of such examples, where insincere religious leaders have used religion for mass manipulation to achieve their own political agenda. Blind imitation of the followers towards dogmas and authority figures, unfortunately without in-depth knowledge of religious law is a very dangerous combination. Religious politics manipulate human emotions and use wars, crusades, and jihad as an excuse for personal and political gains. It is not religion itself that is a problem but the misuse of power and authority that comes along with it and the negative attitude behind it.

The news coverage in media regarding world affairs highlights the negative events associated with religion undermining the positive contribution of religious communities and the impact of religion on social wellbeing.

The issue of religion being a source of conflict is a multifaceted and complex issue that should be analyzed by peeling off the layers. Religion affects every aspect of human life, such as social, economic, emotional, psychological, and spiritual, it is beyond ritualistic practice. We have briefly examined the impact of religion through a sociological context.

In order to peel the layers of this complex issue, we need to analyze it through a psycho-spiritual perspective as well because our view of life and religion affects our psychological well-being. Integrating spirituality and faith into coaching, counseling, or Existential psychotherapy is important because more than 92% of Americans believe in spirituality. The aim of religious belief whether Christianity, Islam, or Judaism is to lead one towards spiritual maturity. Religion is not about following empty rituals, mindlessly at the cost of abandoning your intellect but cultivating faith and depending on a higher power in time of need besides seeking professional help from Life Coaches, counselors, or therapists. Integrating spirituality into psychotherapy or Life coaching is relevant for the following reasons;

1- If you have faith-based clients, struggling with religious or spiritual issues such as; dealing with religious conflict in personal interactions, the crisis of faith, dealing with conflicting religious values -Inability to reconcile with personal faith and social representation. lack of connection with one’s faith community or religion. Misrepresentation of religious beliefs by other members leads to confusion and inner conflict.

2- Religion and spirituality serve as coping mechanisms for those who seek comfort in religious practices. They turn towards prayers when facing stress, personal conflict, or national disaster. Therefore, religious practices are intertwined with faith and spirituality. For a faith-based client seeking professional help, it is a disservice to ignore the spiritual aspect of his/ her life since the faith community may serve as a source of strength and help in resolving difficult issues that the client may be facing psychologically.

Conclusion: Every belief that we form, philosophy, or rituals that we follow or choose not to follow contributes to the psychological makeup and well-being. The formation of the individual’s thought pattern, psyche, behavior, and attitude contribute to our positive & negative views of religion and life itself.
