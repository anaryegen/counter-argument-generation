When the instrument is to be used to determine the potential difference between two conductors, they are connected to the two opposite pairs of quadrants.

The formula indicates that the sensibility of the instrument should increase with the charge of the Leyden jar or needle, whereas Hopkinson found that as the potential of the needle was increased by working the replenisher of the jar, the deflection due to three volts difference between the quadrants first increased and then diminished.

He found that when the potential of the needle exceeded a certain value, of about volts, for the particular instrument he was using (made by White of Glasgow), the above formula did not hold good.

If the quadrants were near together there were certain limits between which the potential of the needle might vary without producing more than a small change in the deflection corresponding with the fixed potential difference of the quadrants.

In this case the deflection of the needle was practically quite constant when its potential varied from to 3227 volts.

Examples of Potential Energy

Potential energy is stored energy from an object. Instead of coming from motion, it can come from its position relative to others, internal stress, electric charge, or its condition. This object has the capability of producing energy as these conditions change. This energy could be mechanical energy, chemical energy, electric energy, nuclear energy, or magnetic energy.

Different Types of Energy With Everyday Examples
