Basketball includes a wide range of physical actions with and without the ball, which puts forward certain requirements for motor fitness, moral, volitional and mental qualities, as well as creativity and decision-making skills in rapidly changing and often unforeseen circumstances. The scientific novelty is determined by the fact that in order to categorically define the term of “features of physical and mental development and their connection with regular physical exercise”, the authors analysed the works of leading scientists on the theory and methods of physical education, grouped by the authors in accordance with the main concepts. The aim of the article is to study of the phenomenon of physical culture of the student’s personality, namely, the targets of the modern system of physical education and the structure of personal physical culture of a person; the humanisation and democratisation of the system of physical education; the development of the concept of the theory of physical culture and its implementation in the conditions of reformation of higher education. The practical significance of the study is determined by the fact that the elements of basketball are included in the programmes of physical education of preschool children, in the curricula for physical culture of all degrees of general secondary education (primary, secondary, high school), in the programme for physical education of higher education institutions.

Keywords: Research, Influence, Physical health, Lifestyle, Working capacity

Starting to consider the understanding of the physical culture of the student’s personality as a social and individual value, it is necessary first of all to determine the meaning of the concepts used. Therefore, the central focus of the study is to clarify the term of “physical culture of the individual”. The categorical field of the concept “physical culture of the student’s personality” includes the following terms: “culture”, “physical culture”, “physical culture of the individual” and “physical education”. First of all, let us note that these concepts do not have an unambiguous interpretation in psychological and pedagogical theories and have changed depending on the level of development of society, science in general, and pedagogy in particular. This, in turn, requires an interdisciplinary theoretical search, analysis of primary sources in the field of philosophy, sociology, pedagogy, and psychology. Considering the essence of the concept of “culture”, it is necessary to pay attention to its most general features inherent in it, regardless of the specific historical conditions and forms of existence. That is, the essence of culture lies in a system of ways, means and results of the establishment, functioning and development of a person, which means, the process of becoming, creating and reproducing it as a subject of social reality in the course of mastering and understanding nature.

Culture has a deep humanistic orientation and is a significant social and personal value. It combines: the final product of human activity; a person as an active social being, a creatively developed personality, the very process of purposeful socially useful activity. Science identifies many different types of culture that together make up the overall culture of society and the individual (Babich et al., 2017). One of its components is physical culture, which should be characterised by its phenomenality, which consists in the exceptional function of combining the social and biological principles in a person (Bakema et al., 2020). Physical culture arose at the same time with general culture in the early stages of the development of civilisation. At first, the means of physical culture reflected the material living standard of a person and emerged, as a rule, from natural forms of movement (walking, trail running, throwing stones and sticks, jumping, swimming, etc.) and were used mainly to prepare people for existence (Kaufman & Duckworth, 2017). Subsequently, the concept of “culture” combined an increasingly wide range of objects, phenomena, and actions, the common properties of which were their supernatural character, their human, not heavenly origin.

The optimal type of physical exercise, which has both health-improving, upbringing, educational, and applied value, is popular among young people is competitive sports (Mertens et al., 2019). Competitive sports (Zhang et al., 2020) contribute to the improvement of physical, mental and personal qualities of schoolchildren and students, including motor, applied, volitional, moral, patriotic, and aesthetic aspects of their life and future professional activities (Liu et al., 2020). Among a large number of competitive sports, those game sports are of particular interest and have a complex impact on the development of the individual and the team, in particular basketball (Schwenck et al., 2021). Today, basketball is widely used at various levels of education – from preschool to higher education (Rourke & Wilson, 2017).

The following research methods were used in this study (Bianco et al., 2021):

theoretical: analysis and generalisation of scientific, educational and methodological literature and best practice experience, pedagogical modelling, which made it possible to find out the current state of the problem under study, systematise and summarise information about the object and subject of research (Chiu et al., 2020);

empirical: pedagogical observation and survey to study the practical experience of organising basketball training in the process of physical education in higher education institutions; questionnaire of students to find out their motivational priorities and subjective information about the object of research; anthropometry and physiometry to assess physical development indicators; pedagogical testing to assess the indicators of motor fitness of young people (Elkins et al., 2019);

pedagogical experiment: the ascertaining stage for studying the motivation, physical development and motor readiness of students; the forming stage for testing the methods of using technical equipment for the development of motor qualities of students in the process of basketball training and evaluating its effectiveness (Guler , 2022);

methods of statistical data processing, in particular, a sample method for processing experimental data, qualitative and quantitative analysis of research results, and verification of their reliability (Luo et al., 2020).

At the same time, basketball classes in educational institutions do not require special conditions of organisation and can be held both in the gym and outdoors, can be conducted with a contingent of different ages, genders, and levels of technical and physical fitness, which makes it possible to attribute basketball to one of the effective means of physical education (Maglica et al., 2021).

An important place in modern research is given to basketball as an effective means of professional and applied training of students (Ferioli et al., 2020). Basketball classes not only promote the development of the necessary basic and special physical qualities (Smogorzewska et al., 2020), but also foster the applied psychological qualities and properties of the psyche, as well as the personal and social values of students (Filipiak & Łubianka, 2020). The use of the game directly for production purposes is of great importance for improving the quality of professional training, enhancing the acquisition of professional and applied skills, and improving physical and mental performance (Xu, 2022). Basketball includes a variety of movements, both mechanical and natural (walking, running, jumping, throwing, and catching the ball), strengthening the musculoskeletal system, improves the functioning of all body systems of those who are engaged, and a quick change of game situations improves the functioning of visual, tactile, motor, vestibular, auditory analysers (Malinauskas et al., 2018). Therefore, the use of basketball tools in physical education classes in higher education institutions is important in the professional and applied training of students of all groups of specialisations (Zhai et al., 2020).

Influence of physical exercises on child’s development

Basketball as a means of physical education is actively used in various forms of organising physical exercises in the conditions of higher education institutions, in particular in compulsory classes, sections, sports events, and independent work on physical education (Luo et al., 2020). Basketball contributes to the implementation of the following educational, health, and upbringing tasks (Fig. 1).

The tasks of basketball

The specific features of basketball for solving the problems of physical education of students are highlighted:

the naturalness of the movements included in the arsenal of technical actions;

the different nature of physical activity, which includes the performance of movements by different muscle groups, variable intensity, strength, duration, and has a complex effect on the body, contributes to the development of basic physical qualities, the development of various motor skills;

high motor density, ensuring the active performance of motor actions during the lesson;

teamness of actions, determined by the important value for the realisation of oneself in a team, brings up communicative skills and personal traits of character;

the competitive nature of classes, educating moral, volitional, and leadership qualities;

rapid change of game situations, which has a positive effect on the development of mental qualities – thinking, memory, attention;

high emotionality creates favourable conditions for active recreation, educates the ability to manage emotions and the ability to self-control;

independence of actions contributes to the development of self-organisation and creative initiative.

Due to the above features, basketball can be considered a comprehensive means of physical education of students from the position of preparing a fully developed personality of future specialists. The popularity of basketball among students of higher education institutions of pedagogical, engineering, economic and other profiles is confirmed by research. Basketball classes provide high motor activity of students, and make it possible to provide a minimum need for movement. Physical activity plays an important role in maintaining physical health, the development of various motor abilities, and also helps to strengthen the overall emotional background, gives psychological relief in the conditions of intensive educational activities of students (Heydari et al., 2021).

The motor fitness of students who are systematically engaged in basketball is based on the preparation of the musculoskeletal system for high-intensity physical exercise, the development of active muscle mass, and physical performance. During the game activity, functional changes in the body are observed. Thus, the pulse rate can reach 180–230 b/min, oxygen consumption is within 72.3–96.6% of the maximum, the respiratory rate reaches 50–60 respiratory cycles per minute, and the minute volume of breathing reaches up to 120-150 L, and a noticeable oxygen deficit is formed, which reaches 4-8 L. The average energy consumption of basketball players per game is 900–1200 kcal. Thus, basketball classes contribute to a complex effect on the body of those who are engaged, improve the functional state of the cardiovascular, respiratory, and nervous systems of the body, improve metabolism (Ferioli et al., 2020).

Basketball classes involve the development of various physical qualities, in particular speed, strength, coordination abilities, and endurance. This is facilitated by the need to quickly overcome distances, breakthroughs and jerks, jumping and handing off the ball over long distances, the need to accurately perform techniques, in particular throws from different distances, active long movements with the ball and without reducing performance, etc. About 70% of all basketball players’ movements are of a speed-power character, which creates prerequisites for the development of explosive power. Training on the technique of movements in basketball and its improvement during systematic classes develops the accuracy of differentiation and evaluation of spatial, power, and time parameters of movements, the ability to coordinate individual movements into complete combinations.

Basketball in the conditions of higher education institutions is conditionally divided into two types: mass and high-performance basketball. In the physical education of students, the means of basketball are various methods of teaching the technique of exercises and physical training. As a rule, the idea of the game and the basic skills of ball possession, already formed in the course of physical education lessons and sectional classes in institutions of general secondary education or children’s and youth sports schools. Depending on where students previously studied basketball, the level of their technical and physical fitness differs. Therefore, the content and parameters of physical activity in the course of basketball classes differ for different students. Another feature that distinguishes basketball is the simplicity of organising and conducting competitions. Basketball competitions can be easily modified and held among players of different numbers, gender, and level of fitness, in particular in the conditions of a sports hall or on an outdoor playground, on the entire area of the playing field, both in full squads of five players, and in the number of three, two and one player per team. This is convenient in the conditions of a higher education institution, where the students’ group may be heterogeneous (Babich et al., 2017).

Modern practitioners strive to use a limited set of the most effective and rational means in the process of teaching basketball to students, taking into account the game proficiency of those who are engaged, that is, to minimise the cost of energy resources and time with optimal quality of work in a limited time. In such conditions, the use of training equipment will significantly increase the effectiveness of using special exercises in basketball and will increase the progress of training by purposefully influencing those muscle groups that participate in the performance of techniques and the development of a dynamic stereotype of movements clearly according to the specified parameters: efforts, distance, time, amplitude, trajectory, and so on (Luo et al., 2020).

Specific basketball exercises related to the game techniques are actively used not only to teach the elements of the game, but also to develop the special physical qualities of those who are engaged. The conventional approaches to the development of physical qualities by means of sports games include the use of general development, special development, and preparatory exercises, training on movement techniques, and direct game activity in competitive conditions. The use of these exercises includes a wide arsenal of tools for developing strength, speed, endurance, coordination abilities, and flexibility of various types and directions (Fig. 2). An additional tool that enhances the developing effect of physical exercises is technical equipment and inventory. In the course of sports games, depending on the age of those who are engaged, stationary and portable exercise machines are used – a variety of modified devices to complicate the conditions for performing exercises, charging, leaders, etc.

Means of development of power and speed-power qualities in basketball

In the process of learning techniques, especially at the final stages, the effect of a positive “transfer” of the skill on the motor abilities of the students is manifested. The physiological basis of the motor skill is the development of a dynamic stereotype – a system of excitatory-inhibitory processes in the central nervous system, which ensures the regular and consistent introduction of the constituent motor acts (Filipiak & Łubianka, 2020). A positive transfer of the completeness of motor skills to the manifestation of motor qualities and vice versa occurs due to an increase in the level of coordination of motor acts due to the improvement of intramuscular coordination, as well as an improvement in the vegetative component, i.e., the activity of respiration, blood circulation, and sensory systems of the body. Therefore, in the process of learning the technique of movements, there is also the development of both coordination and conditioning qualities.

Game activity is a method of combined influence on the simultaneous improvement of the level of physical and technical fitness of students in the absence of a clear dosage of physical activity parameters and high emotionality. However, due to the need to repeatedly perform various technical actions in combination with other movements in the circumstances of dynamic and competitive struggle during the game, there is an increase in various aspects of fitness, including the development of mental properties and the education of moral and volitional qualities and personal traits. The influence of various forms of basketball classes on the physical fitness of students of higher educational institutions of various profiles has been proven by a number of researchers (Smogorzewska et al., 2020).

Depending on the level of fitness of students and the type of strength, respectively, the amount of weight, the number of series, repetitions and duration, and the appropriate character of the rest are selected. The development of speed by means of basketball includes exercises to improve the timing of various motor reactions and the frequency of movements. For students with a low level of fitness, the means for developing speed are short-distance running, outdoor games, relay races, speed exercises (running on the spot, running with a sharp change in direction and stopping at a signal, general development exercises with an emphasis on speed and repetition rate, etc.), special running and game exercises, a game of basketball.

The development of students’ coordination abilities by means of basketball consists not only in mastering various technical actions in attack and defense, but also in the use of exercises with an emphasis on the accuracy of performing movements in space, time, muscle efforts, combining different movements in direction and nature. The level of development of coordination abilities in basketball is shown in the level of performance of game techniques. The content of the students’ coordination training by means of basketball includes techniques, various combinations of them, exercises with unusual tasks and in non-standard conditions with an emphasis on accuracy, ball relay races, outdoor games and the game of basketball (Xu, 2022).

Let us focus on the crucial importance of both fast and accurate performance of game actions in the development of performance in basketball. This determines the use of exercises of an appropriate nature in the physical training of students by means of basketball. Thus, for the development of spatial-dynamic accuracy of movements, throws of the ball into the basket from different distances, handoffs and catches of the ball on the spot and in motion, dribbling the ball with changing hands and the height of the rebound are used. The combinations with dribbling, handing off and throwing the ball in pairs, triples, with the use of passive and active protection are actively used.

An important thing in basketball is the “feeling of the ball” – a complex of specialised perception associated with musculoskeletal, vestibular, visual, and tactile sensations. The feeling of the ball is the highest manifestation of coordination abilities in basketball and is manifested in the perfection of technical skills and their implementation in the conditions of the game, taking into account the opposition of competitors, changing the conditions for performing technical actions, the need to choose the right solution in a specific game situation, high concentration of physical and mental strength, etc. (Malinauskas et al., 2018). For the development of students’ coordination abilities by means of basketball, a variety of game actions are used in unusual conditions. Exercises with unusual tasks include: performing techniques from unusual starting positions, changing the speed, spatial boundaries, method of performance, complicating additional movements, limiting the visual analyser, using a ball of unusual mass and size, changes in the actions of the opponent, applying additional difficulties and knocking factors, and so on. Along with this, one should develop the ability to relax the muscles to prevent increased muscle tone.

For the development of endurance, the main means are 12-minute running, middle-distance running at different speeds, long-distance running, various cyclic exercises, outdoor games. For students of different qualifications, different amounts of low-intensity physical activity are used. The researchers note the possibility of developing special types of endurance by means of basketball. High-speed endurance is manifested in the ability to perform game actions at high speed for a long time without reducing performance. For its development in basketball, various types of running exercises and basic technical and tactical actions are used.

Strength endurance provides high efficiency of game actions and results from the ability to long-term muscle tension. For its development, it is recommended to perform simple strength exercises, performed for the maximum number of times in a given time. Coordination endurance is manifested in the long-term performance of complex coordination exercises. The development of coordination endurance by means of basketball involves long-term performance of game actions without reducing their accuracy (Guler , 2022). For the development of special endurance, specially selected exercises on the technique and tactics of basketball are used, various types of movements with the performance of handoffs, throws, dribbling, performed in series with a large number of repetitions; game exercises 1 × 1, 2 × 2, 3 × 3; two-way games that last 5 to 10 min longer without notifying the athletes, games with the introduction of additional opponents or new opponents who have rested, and so on.

In basketball, a wide range of movements is of great importance for outplaying an opponent in a double-event. In addition, sufficient mobility in the joints and elasticity of the muscles and bands allows avoiding damage and injuries at classes. Therefore, flexibility exercises (or stretching) are included in the process of physical training of students by means of basketball after a full warm-up. Dynamic (swings, bends, lunges) and static (holding the pose) exercises are used, which are usually alternated with strength exercises. At the same time, one should adhere to the main provisions of the general methodology for developing flexibility.

The development of physical qualities of students by means of basketball has its own specifics and is directly related to the training of technical actions. Depending on the level of fitness of students, the content of classes requires a differentiated approach to the use of tools and methods. Along with the traditional approaches to motor training in the course of basketball classes, associated mainly with the use of exercises with the ball and their combinations by repetition or in the conditions of the game, there are ample opportunities for the use of additional inventory and equipment (Bakema et al., 2020). The use of auxiliary technical means of intensifying the educational process makes it possible to successfully implement the principle of individualisation in physical education classes for students. Modern researchers suggest the use of auxiliary tools, in particular training devices and other technical equipment (charges, leaders, etc.). However, most exercise machines are used in the practice of training basketball players of all ages.

Basketball is a comprehensive means of developing the basic physical qualities of students due to a wide range of exercises and methods of their application in the educational process of physical education. The content of physical training of students by means of basketball depends on the level of fitness of those who are engaged. The regulation of the parameters of physical activity is carried out with the growth of the dynamics of motor indicators, the complexity of motor tasks increases with the growth of game proficiency. Training equipment is an additional tool in the process of teaching basketball to students, which allows improving the quality of technical and physical training of young people due to the possibility of influencing those muscle groups and the development of those motor abilities that participate in the game and affect its effectiveness. The use of technical means of training is one of the most important areas of modern physical education, which increases its quality. The use of training devices in the conditions of training sessions allows increasing their effectiveness without significantly increasing the volume and intensity of physical activity. The training equipment makes it possible to simulate different modes of muscle work in conditions close to the specific structure of physical exercises.

Phycological aspect in team games’ activities

Studies have shown that basketball has not only physical, but also mental development (Zhai et al., 2020). Players must go through the mental process of quickly assessing what is happening on the court and react immediately and effectively. This constant, effective decision-making helps developing brain cells. In basketball, players must use both physical and mental strength to make winning score. Playing basketball also increases self-confidence and self-esteem. By scoring shots and making game points, the player really increases their confidence. Often, during a basketball game, especially for the student intramural team, a large crowd gathers there. When the brain hears a greeting, it quickly adapts and adjusts to win. This phenomenon increases brain power. Engaging in physical sports with people improves interpersonal communicative skills and increases the ability to work well in groups. All it takes to play this game is one basketball and a ring.

Basketball is based on unexpected jerks, instant stops, requires running at the speed of the best sprinters. For 40 min of playing time, the player runs 5–7 km, performs a large number of jumps and throws, such specifics of the game are determined by the small size of the court and the need to suddenly switch from one action to another, to act in conditions of a constant time limit imposed by the degree of opposition of the competitor. Basketball is a powerful way to promote mental health. Especially for young people who are depressed, basketball provides an opportunity to escape from the difficult realities that life can bring. Basketball gives young people hope and allows them to develop mental health skills that they can use throughout their lives. Basketball allows young people to develop the necessary confidence, empathy, and team building skills. Despite popular belief, confidence can be built, and basketball is the perfect way to help young people boost their self-esteem and self-confidence (Zhang et al., 2020).

Basketball offers fantastic health benefits and mental cognition. When a student plays basketball, he must be constantly aware of what is happening around him. This serves to sharpen the overall mental focus. The student must know where the other players are and what moves to make next. Decisions must be made in a split second, and he is often under pressure to react quickly and accurately to his opponents. Since basketball helps improve motor skills and coordination, the player finds that other areas of life that also use these skills improve. Basketball helps building self-confidence and increasing overall self-esteem. According to research, it also helps to improve sleep and reduce stress. While playing basketball, the brain releases “feeling-good” hormones such as dopamine and endorphins. These chemicals make the game of basketball positively addictive. In extremely short periods of time (fraction of a second), the brain of a basketball player perceives and processes information from various body systems (Maglica et al., 2021). But this is not enough, one also needs to imagine possible changes in the game environment, otherwise the player’s efforts will not reach the goal. Only in this case the player is able to make the right decision in this situation and choose the appropriate tactical actions. All these processes – from the beginning of the perception of the situation to the performance of the reception (throwing, leading, or passing the ball) – take basketball players only 1.5-2 s, and master sportsmen – only about 1 s. This shows what requirements basketball has for quick brain action.

Engagement in sports activity is an effective tool to learn emotional intelligence as well. The main reason for it – is competition between sportsmen with different physical, mental, and, obviously, emotional backgrounds. Namely, sports competitions could influence strongly athletes, basketballers, in particular, emotional life. The root of such a significant impact is in a high level of experiencing opposite emotions in a short time period. For example, during the match basketballers could feel anxiety, anger, and confusion but they still have to continue the play at a high level to achieve the team’s goal. In this context, expanding the knowledge of the role of the emotional state of the athletes, as well as the formulating of emotional stability through sports activities, is a priority direction on the way to the development of psychological and mental sustainability of the children.

The affect regulation strategies generated by S.-J. Blakemore (2019) could be implemented as a new psychological approach in order to ease the regulation of different emotions during the competitions without distraction by extraneous factors. According to Jekauc et al. (2021) theory, there are six ways to control emotions during sports competitions and prevent the effect. Among them: regulation of the triggering processes; usage of muscles relaxation techniques (progressive muscle relaxation); action tendencies regulation (into suitable and targeted actions); conscious choice of the way to express a desired affective state; awareness of the personal affective states; emotional regulation through the higher cognitive processes (imagination of desired states, setting and achieving goals, controlling thoughts).

Despite the sport’s influence on emotional maturation, another feature could be taken on as a result of participating the team games in early childhood. It is noticeable that decision-making skills also could be developed through sports activities. The research of the Pastor-Vicedo et al. (2020) show the link between the level of giftedness, career success, and decision-making process of young soccer players. After conducting the experiment, scientists concluded that exactly speed and variability of decisions made during the game are the key to the prosperity of football players in this sport. Soccer as basketball is a team game, therefore, the importance of the decision-making skills developing in the team players should be not underestimated by the coaches.

The COVID-19 pandemic attacked a world society’s psyche in all respects. The coronavirus pandemic gave impetus to some important changes in the social system nowadays (Ramkissoon, 2022a). Nevertheless, this uneasy and tragic period encouraged psychologists to invent new methods for the protection of human mental health. The researchers conducted by Ramkissoon (2020, 2022b) demonstrates that the prosocial and pro-environmental position of people in isolation conditions could become a natural one, and promote further to their and to even the planet’s health. Even in a pandemic case, individual basketball training could be a resultative way for children to avoid a depressive mood and keep brain activity at the same level. The global pandemic has defined clear boundaries for where people live. Such places often became private houses and apartments. In the context of a person getting used to a certain place of residence, but given the problems that arose as a result of not being able to travel to another place for a while, daily individual basketball lessons in the backyard or at the nearest sports ground could help adolescents avoid mental trauma, which often resulted from prolonged isolation of children (Roheger et al., 2022).

One of the leading places among such approaches, oddly enough, was in the steady integration of physical activity into people’s everyday routines. Examination of the level of happiness and satisfaction with life among line dancers shows that sports activity helps to prevent depression disease during the coronavirus period. Moreover, participants of the research noticed increasing in their brain activity, especially dancing helped them to avoid memory problems (Aliberti & Raiola, 2021). Basketball, in turn, allows children to throw out negative energy, as well as get rid of hyperactivity, which often interferes with the healthy formation of their still unstable psyche (Sakibaev et al., 2019). Young basketball team members learn how to apply and create methods for regulating the emotional and physical state during the game, which can later be applied outside the sports field.

Modern training systems are complex mechanisms that combine advanced achievements in mechanics, biomechanics, cybernetics, and electronics (Guler, 2022). The history of the development of simulators shows that from the beginning, the main direction of their use was to improve the physical qualities and functional capabilities of athletes. Over time, the use of training devices extends to other areas of activity – military training, cosmonautics, medicine, and the like (Bakema et al., 2020). At the same time, exercise machines gained popularity among the general population as a means of physical development, health promotion, disease prevention and restoration of lost body functions, and so on (Blakemore, 2019). Gradually, exercise machines appeared in educational institutions to solve the problems of physical education of students (Gamero et al., 2021).

According to Xu (2022), today, in pedagogical practice, there are a large number of training devices that differ in their pedagogical orientation and design solutions. They can be conditionally divided into the following: large-sized equipment, which includes stationary basic structures; simulators and other devices that can be easily combined into different configurations; relatively small, individual, correctional, and gaming equipment (Yessimov et al., 2020). Considering the impact of basketball on the physical and psychological aspects from a medical point of view, the following can be said. Playing basketball is a great form of cardiovascular disease prevention (Slobozhaninov et al., 2018). Expert research has proven that performing cardiovascular exercises reduces the risk of heart disease and stroke (Roheger et al., 2022). One hour of playing basketball burns between 630 and 750 calories. Basketball is an excellent sport that provides an optimal anaerobic load.

The physical movements required to play this game improve bone health. New bone tissue is formed over time, when a basketball that is carrying weight is being thrown around the court during strenuous play, thereby increasing bone strength (Elkins et al., 2019). The game provides an exemplary full-body workout. The attributes of the game include strength training, which result in lean and strong muscles. When someone plays strong defense, they should have a strong position when the opponent pushes and tries to pass (Al-Yaaribi et al., 2018). The whole body goes into defensive mode, and the muscles tighten for strength. Playing strong defense will work with the deltoids, traps, lower back, upper back, and core muscles (Blakemore, 2019). Dribbling and shooting the ball trains all the muscles of the arms, as well as the shoulder joints. Running across the entire court during a game makes for a huge workout for all the leg muscles (Orhan & Eskiyecek, 2018).

Playing basketball, one learns two important body skills: balance and coordination; the body learns to maintain balance and maintain a strong posture. This ability is a great trait that is used in our daily lives (Nanda et al., 2021). The spinal cord, in addition to the entire body, trains to support a strong posture and maintain balance. The second skill acquired during basketball practice is hand-eye coordination. One must either drive the ball to pass through the court, or to a team mate, and also try to make a throw to the basket (Smogorzewska et al., 2020). The hand and movements must match the eye coordination. This sends strong and fast signals to the brain cells so that they respond quickly and efficiently (Bianco et al., 2021).

Prospective ways to improve the effectiveness of physical education in higher education institutions are the sports orientation of the educational process and the activation of sectional work, the renewal of conventional and non-conventional means, methods, and forms that comprehensively combine health and professional orientation, the implementation of didactic content in classes on personality-oriented choice of motor activity and taking into account the individual capabilities of the student, which makes it possible to achieve high variability and motor density, increase the activity of students, taking into account their needs and interests.

The optimal type of physical exercise, which has both health-improving, educational, and applied value and is popular among young people is sports games. Basketball has a complex impact on the development of the individual and the team, including the motor, applied, volitional, moral, patriotic, and aesthetic aspects of the life and future professional activities of students. Basketball classes can be held in various forms of organising physical exercises in the conditions of a higher education institution, do not need special organisation conditions and are implemented both in the gym and outdoors, with a contingent of different ages, genders, levels of technical and physical fitness. The quality of the educational process in basketball depends on its proper planning (the development of the content, means, and methods of teaching techniques and the development of physical qualities, the selection of parameters of physical activity and their rational regulation), as well as on an objective assessment of the motor skills of students.

During the research, the specific features of basketball for solving the problems of physical education of students were highlighted. Also, the attention of scientists was directed to the study and determination of the ways in which basketball lessons positively affect the physical and psychological health of young athletes. The impact of lockdown, in particular during the coronavirus pandemic, has also been analyzed in the context of basketball practice. The phenomenon of physical culture of the student’s personality was studied. The suggestions for development the concept of the theory of physical culture in high school were presented.

A significant disadvantage of the modern system of physical education of students is the conservative content, means, methods, and standardised forms of physical exercises, low professional orientation, insufficient introduction of unconventional means of motor activity, modern types of physical culture and recreation activities, innovative teaching technologies, additional technical equipment for solving pedagogical tasks.
