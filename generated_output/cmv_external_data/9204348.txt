NASA RETURNS EXCEPTIONAL VALUE

NASA’s unique mission provides benefits in big and small ways. Dollars spent for space exploration create jobs, jumpstart businesses, and grow the economy. Our innovations improve daily life, advance medical research, support disaster response, and more. We’re constantly evolving and finding new ways to add value. NASA’s economic impact is nationwide, extending to all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

NASA Strengthens the Economy

Each state plays a role in space exploration and discovery, including the Artemis program to land the first woman and first person of color on the Moon. The impact of NASA spending is spread across all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

We released the second agencywide economic impact report in 2022, using data from the 2021 fiscal year. The report estimates NASA efforts during that period: 1—Generated more than $71.2 billion in total economic output 2—Supported more than 339,600 jobs nationwide 3—Resulted in an estimated $7.9 billion in federal, state, and local tax revenues Economic Impact Study about NASA Strengthens the Economy

The core stage of the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket for NASA’s Artemis I mission has been placed on the mobile launcher in between the twin solid rocket boosters inside the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center.

NASA ensures inventions for space find practical uses closer to home.

They often become solutions to different challenges – ones we didn’t set out to solve. Called NASA spinoffs, they help detect breast cancer, protect firefighters, nourish newborns, and more. The International Space Station has led to many spinoffs and facilitated numerous technological and scientific advancements. Research in space helps improve health on Earth, from understanding bone loss to developing vaccines to improving eye surgery. Using the space station and NASA satellites, we study Earth from space. NASA data helps predict the weather, monitor natural disasters like hurricanes and wildfires, and study long-term climate trends. NASA spinoffs about NASA Improves Life

NASA astronaut and Expedition 62 Flight Engineer Jessica Meir conducts cardiac research in the Life Sciences Glovebox located in the Japanese Kibo laboratory module. The Engineered Heart Tissues investigation could promote a better understanding of cardiac function in microgravity which would be useful for drug development and other applications related to heart conditions on Earth.

NASA Fosters American Innovation

We invest in cutting-edge technologies to help maintain America’s competitive advantage.

Advancements in flight thanks to NASA include commercial supersonic air travel, electric-powered flight, and improvements to air mobility. NASA funding helps small businesses research new ideas and develop innovative aeronautics, human exploration, science, and space technology solutions. Our partnerships fuel growth in industries that will define the future, such as artificial intelligence and advanced manufacturing. Learn More about NASA Fosters American Innovation

More nations are active in space than ever before, and international partnerships are key to humanity’s continued achievements in space.

For more than 20 years, humans have continuously lived and worked 250 miles above Earth aboard the space station. It is the largest peacetime, multinational effort in history, representing 15 nations and five space agencies. As NASA returns to the Moon with our partners, the Artemis Accords serve as a set of guiding principles for international cooperation in the next phase of human space exploration.
