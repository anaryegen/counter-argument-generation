The Fortune Change the World list was built on the premise that the profit motive can inspire companies to tackle society’s unmet needs. And I mean, duh. There have been hundreds of studies on money as a motivator for success. But this year’s list had another key piece of criteria for nomination: the premise that no businesses can succeed alone. 

In the wake of the past year’s global challenges—the pandemic, climate change and systemic racism—cooperation amongst businesses has become a coveted component of success. Competitive instincts may typically rule the day in capitalism, but now, weaving in purpose and doing good requires a mindset that may sometimes feel counterintuitive. 

The benefits to cross-business collaboration range from scaling innovation to solving complex problems that individual businesses couldn’t accomplish on their own. It makes sense—strategic partnerships broaden customer relevance and reach. And during a period of time in which the world stands at the crossroads of three global crises, customer reach and relevance is more important than ever, making this year’s Top 10 companies listed that much more impressive. 

Walmart for instance has made its sixth consecutive appearance on the list for partnering with the National Restaurant Association at the height of the pandemic to recruit workers displaced from elsewhere in the industry. This perhaps unlikely pairing protected thousands during this period of high unemployment. 

Facing another crisis, financial planning and investment management company BlackRock announced back in January that it now considers climate change an investment risk. As the world’s largest asset manager, with $7.3 trillion under management, BlackRock recognized the power it had to hold its companies accountable and affect real change.

Recognizing the interconnectedness of each business’s responsibility and effect on the world, companies seem to be solving more problems than ever. And truly, no entity has embodied teamwork better than the pharmaceutical industry. 

Aptly named The Vaccine Makers, the #1 recipient of the Change the World title is the amalgamation of companies currently working at breakneck speeds to find a safe and approved COVID-19 vaccine. The race for a cure demonstrates cooperation at scale that’s never been seen before and, while we don’t know yet which—if any—of the trial vaccines will be effective, Big Pharma’s work lights the path leading to a future in which companies will be ready to extend their shared purpose to the unmet needs of the world. 

Money may be a motivator for success, but collaboration elevates it to a global scale. Working together with purpose reinforces our collective success and, ultimately, provides a long-lasting foundation for a bright future. And with the way things are right now, I’d really like to see that.
