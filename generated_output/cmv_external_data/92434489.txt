What do you think of the Libertarian to Fascist pipeline?

I understand that this has little to do with economics, but rather extremism. Since libertarianism can be described as a more radical belief, which introduces you to even more radical beliefs.

They do share some identical beliefs as well, such as protecting the elite and hostile to socialism/working class. A lot of American libertarians also glorify the state and heroism, due to patriotism and militarism.

I would not consider this a pipeline. Rather, individuals who are already rather conservative call themselves libertarian to appear more socially palatable.

The truth is that there are 2 kinds of “libertarians.” The ones who actually care about economics and law are the boring kind which nobody hears about. The ones who spend their time railing against PC culture and SJWs, promoting “race realism” and mocking minorities get all the media attention. As a result people think that these libertarians are legit, which is nonsense. They are just straight up cultural conservatives.

There is a deeper ideological problem, however. The concerns of pro-capitalist libertarians about authoritarian rule are almost always confined solely to the state. They may pay lip service to the idea of decentralized power as free market supporters, but typically they are not bothered by corporate power unless it is piggybacking off of the government somehow.

In my experience, this seems to be because right libertarians are usually people who benefit/are not harmed by de facto power structures, they just want to pay less in taxes and not have their morality dictated to them by the state. The kind of empathy it takes to understand why, say, a South African gold miner would not just dislike state authority, but also workplace hierarchies, would necessitate applying anti-authoritarian ideas in a more principled way.

I don't want to accuse all right libertarians of being unempathetic, but that lack of empathy definitely can encourage that thought process, and also lead to that race realist thinking where African countries fail just because their IQs are lower. There's a psychological connection there, imho.

Those on the left tend to draw a distinction between action taken in service of some economic goal (profit, utility, etc.) and action directed towards some higher social principle (justice, the good, equality).

Libertarians (of the kind I'm speaking of) however, understand that even our most "virtuous" behaviors are fundamentally economic. If economics is at the heart of all human interaction, it is impossible to abolish markets, state or no state. Therefore, it makes sense to direct one's ire towards the political sphere, which has had and always will have the primary purpose of restricting human behavior in order to entrench the privilege of the few.

The kind of empathy it takes to understand why, say, a South African gold miner would not just dislike state authority, but also workplace hierarchies, would necessitate applying anti-authoritarian ideas in a more principled way.

I do not agree that this is an expression of empathy. The reality is that an analysis of class is only made possible in an environment which possesses the requisite wealth to effectively subsidize intellectual pursuits in that area. A gold miner or sweatshop worker more likely than not does not have the time, energy or luxury to even endeavor to consider the notion of "class struggle." Instead, it is the intellectuals, academics and politicians who look on from afar and prescribe solutions to various perceived ills.

But is this empathy? I would say no. Our "analysis" of particular circumstances is not a substitute for the direct lived-in experience of people actually who actually exist within those circumstances. In fact, we should consider our knowledge to be incomplete at best. Having never been a subsistence farmer myself, how could I reliably advise a subsistence farmer as to the best methods to better their station? Rather, I should check my moral intuitions which my relative luxury has endowed me with, and instead recognize that other individuals possess a knowledge of time and place which I could never possess myself. To do otherwise is not empathy but sympathy.

This is exactly my thoughts on it. It's a matter of group semiotics, as opposed to individuals changing opinions over time (generally speaking, of course).

This is highly inaccurate. American Libertarians are some of the biggest critics of the state as they are about small government and working towards letting people be their own independent selves, not puppets to the state. The current Republican corruption is a pipeline perhaps, but even that can be seen as grasping straws.

Before you go spouting incorrect statements. Make sure it is correct. Google Libertarian Party of America to get proper information on the party.

Is the idea here that the only libertarians who count as libertarians in the USA are the ones who are formally members of the political party?

If so, then it might not be the sort that OP is talking about.

Where I am getting at is there are people who the media proclaim to be libertarian that are completely not and have only been claimed. If the OP is basing their entire thought process on those or ones who claim it then start stating inaccurate beliefs, then yeah I agree he is off on his discussion point.

The way that u/Anen-o-me puts it (and he may correct me if I misquote him), is that historically, there have been alt-right sorts who claimed libertarianism as an ideology because it was convenient in the short-run to borrow their legitimacy, and there was SOME overlap in the positions in the short run.

As a classical capitalist, I understand that frustration since I sometimes see alt-right sorts trying to pass off their views as capitalist ideology. It took capitalism 400-500 years to build the sort of cultural legitimacy it has today, and they're essentially trying to piggy-back on that.

Milo Yiannopoulos: who used to present himself as a free-speech activist.

Chris "the crying nazi" Cantwell: Whose political debut was apparently as a libertarian political candidate. He was also an activist who felt that parking enforcement is an NAP violation.

Ron Paul: Dodged being labeled alt-right because he dumps the blame for some of the more bigoted content in his newsletter on others.

Literally all of these, except for Ron Paul( b/c wtf he’s not alt-right lol. Alt-right is a new fringe movement. Ron Paul is neither of those things. Having some bigoted things in your newsletters doesn’t affiliate you with the alt-right movement) are examples of a phenomenon u/bowlpotato pointed out. People with already white-supremacist leanings finding the libertarians and using their talking points because they think it is a way to explain why white people are in power and should stay that way.

Even if you consider Ron Paul alt-right he is for sure not a “leader” of the movement.

I was mainly just chiming in to say that classical market-capitalism has seen this sort of ideological piggy-backing before numerous times as well.

Have you not been to the libertarian sub-reddit? They don't like it when you criticize the US. Protecting the elite is in the ideology........ There's a reason why socialism emphasizes on worker rights.Fascists and libertarians are both hostile to unions/socialism, as they prefer private property over public and the wealthy to the working class.

It's always amazing when an author who knows literally nothing about either the alt-right or American libertarianism seeks to opine on them as if they are some sort of expert.

I mean, ultimately, it's Rothbard's (and Rockwell's and Paul's) fault. What happened was by the late 80s, Rothbard had already been pushed out of Cato, in part due to personal conflicts with Ed Crane (who the Kochs brought in to run Cato) and in part due to differences in strategic outlook re: how best to pursue libertarian advocacy. Crane, and ultimately Koch, advocated for gradualism in terms of policy approach, and endorsed Ed Clark, the LP's presidential candidate, in 1980; Rothbard, on the other hand, rejected gradualist approaches, and instead believed that the libertarian-Austrian position should be embraced fully and immediately by movement candidates. Rothbard was pushed out by 1982, and participated in the formation of the Ludwig von Mises Institute, which is now eponymous with the libertarian-alt-right nexus, while Cato and most of the rest of the Kochtopus became more closely associated with Chicago school economics and very much less associated with the LvMI-branch of libertarianism.

Anyway, around the same time Ron Paul was making a name for himself with his criticism of the Reagan administration, and after he left congress following a defeat in the Texas Senate primary, he began closely collaborating with LvMI chairman (and his former chief of staff) Lew Rockwell to develop a propaganda program designed to appeal to anti-government sentiments among rural white Americans, which would later manifest itself in the form of the militia movement (and, ultimately, sovcits) and who they suspected might form a basis for what they viewed as a more orthodox libertarian movement. It also happened that, by this time, Rothbard had fully embraced his past racist tendencies, and coupled with Paul and Rockwell (both of whom can be described more accurately as conservatives than as libertarians, honestly), one of the common points the LvMI folk had with these people is overt bigotry. However, as Nietzsche said, the abyss stares back, the LvMI developed a particularly noxious form of proprietarianism which viewed any political challenge to their agenda as a form of violent aggression and subject to violent reprisal. This compounded with the arrival of HHH, whose writings represent the logical conclusion of this line of thought.

Cato and the Koch-funded network has always been the more policy-relevant group of libertarians, but their gradualist approach coupled with their institutionalization into D.C.'s network of think tanks and policy groups undermines a great deal of their ability to claim to be anti-establishment, though they can fairly be described as such. Meanwhile, LvMI is sitting down in Auburn, Alabama being completely irrelevant to policymakers that don't have the last name Paul, and can easily make claim of the anti-establishment bona fides which relatively uninformed prospective libertarians look for when attempting to validate a source as potentially friendly. So, at the expense of any form of ideological rigor, the LvMI crowd has become little more than a cesspit for anti-government extremists, many of whom oppose the government not on a matter of principle, but because they oppose this particular government, with deep-rooted ties both to the most toxic elements of the GOP, which have always surrounded the Paul family in particular, but countless domestic terrorist and insurgent movements that espouse views that cannot be adequately described as libertarian in any way, shape, or form. And because virtually every other ideology benefits from discrediting anti-statism, being reliant on the State themselves, the narrative that libertarianism is best represented by people who oppose the government because they want to institute a theocracy or bring back slavery has become mainstream even though it has no real basis in fact.

You confuse fascism with the alt-right. Fascism is a specific ideology/philosophy.

What do you think of the Libertarian to

Fascist Alt-Right pipeline?

Libertarians and alt-right both reject egalitarianism and are very dissatisfied with the status quo. Some libertarians come to the conclusion that their ideology is most popular with white people. I don't think that pipeline is as big as it seems: libertarianism/classical liberalism is the baseline in the US. Alt-righters have to have some background ...

I consider myself Hoppean to a large degree. Understood in context he's a true libertarian. The altright largely takes him out of context.

Hoppean language but not ideas have been appropriated by the altright, because they want to claim they have intellectual force behind their concepts and to corrupt libertarians into supporting them, but only milquetoast libertarians could be fooled by that ruse.

Hoppe's "physical removal" statement is meant to be understood within the context of a private law society. The alright erroneously applies to the existing state.

Hoppe has never been one to answer his critics, since it's all there in his writings, and this is no different when it comes to the altright. It is also unclear if he fully understands how his name and concept are being used by the altright.

Or perhaps like Rothbard before him, he's happy to have bedfellows even if they are enemies, because he assumes that thereby some portion will at least read his writings and become converted. Hoppe is old now and desperate to have an impact on the world, as was Rothbard before him.

The tendency of old men is to engage in increasingly desperate moves to grasp as creating the change they want to see. In Rothbard it was allying with people like David Duke or whatever, in the last three years of his life. With Hoppe it may be these alright ruffians.

My major criticism of Hoppe today is that he lays out a program of changes he'd like to see but offers nothing in the way of strategy to get there.

Today it is not the ideas and ideals of ancap that need work, it is strategy and implementation that need work and innovation. I see myself as one of the people trying to work much more on strategy and implementation than on core theory, though I have done theory work on strategy itself over on r/polycentric_law.

Additional comment actions

Fascism and libertarianism both present themselves as the alternative to conventional politics and both frame themselves as right wing (whatever that even means), so anyone who is disenfranchised with the status quo and holds any kind of right wing values is going to be drawn to libertarianism like a mgent as the libertarian movement is by far the most publicised ideology that checks those boxes. Only when people have become aware of their own values and the values of libertarianism will they make the switch, which could take some time as fascism isn't something many people see as a good thing so it's unlikely unselfaware fascists will even look into it for quite some time. Otherwise, it's kind of inevitable that they will be drawn in temporarily.
