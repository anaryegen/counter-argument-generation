Responsibility in Social Work

Viviene E. Cree, in International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioral Sciences (Second Edition), 2015

Individual Responsibility

At its most simple, responsibility is concerned with individual or personal responsibility: individuals are responsible for themselves, their successes and failures. People also may hold responsibility for the action (or inaction) of others who, by virtue of their age and vulnerability, need another person to take some responsibility for them (including very young and very old family members, those who are sick or disabled and in need of care).

This understanding of responsibility is filled with historical resonance. From the seventeenth century onward, ideas of individualism and liberalism were at the heart of political, economic, and social life in the then industrializing world. ‘Laissez-faire’ principles maintained that the market should be free to regulate itself; that government intervention in economics and in society would do more harm than good. At the same time, it was believed that anything was possible for those who worked hard and showed initiative; ‘heaven helps those who help themselves’ was the familiar mantra of the day. Self-help was seen as the best way forward, and any assistance given to needy individuals should be that which encouraged independence and individual responsibility, not dependence and sloth (Fraser, 2009). The idea of individual responsibility is illustrated in the workings of the UK Poor Law (Cree and Myers, 2008). Those in need were classified into two groups: the ‘deserving’ and ‘undeserving’ poor; the deserving poor were those who were prepared to take responsibility and act to improve their situation, while the undeserving poor were characterized as idle, feckless, and irresponsible. When the Charity Organisation Society was formed toward the end of the nineteenth century, the principles of ‘scientific charity’ again highlighted the value of individual responsibility (Seed, 1973: 17).

A very similar presentation of responsibility is found across the world, demonstrated in the popular slogan, “If you give a man a fish you feed him for a day. If you teach a man to fish you feed him for a lifetime” (Kiewra, 2010: 78). Encouraging individual responsibility is not, however, always positive, for the individual or society. Individualism may bring with it selfishness, acquisitiveness, and a lack of concern for others. It may also encourage a culture of blame. Webb points out that “although we are supposed to increasingly take responsibility for our own actions, there is plenty of evidence suggesting we wish to point the finger of blame elsewhere” (2006: 12). He cites obesity as an example of this; people prefer to blame the ‘fast food’ industry for our obese society, rather than confront the more difficult issue of individual choices in eating habits. They are also quick to deny any personal responsibility for ‘bad’ things such as atrocities or torture. Individuals often prefer to acquiesce, obey, and deny responsibility, rather than face up to the challenge of expressing disagreement with others (Cohen, 2000).

Ideas of individual responsibility infuse two current strands within social work: the idea of ‘personalization’ and the notion of ‘responsivity.’ Personalization is a policy initiative that emerged within social care. The not-so-radical idea is that people should be responsible for their own support services, able to determine and manage their own care, rather than fitting in with existing models of service provision. This, of course, reflects notions of individualism discussed above. It also owes allegiance to the idea of ‘client self-determination,’ which came out of casework practice in the 1940s and 1950s (Biestek, 1951) as well as pointing to current ideas about individual rights, illustrated in both Human Rights and Disability Discrimination legislation. Personalization has been viewed by some commentators (for example, Ferguson, 2007; Lymbery, 2012) as a double-edged sword: although it is, in principle, a positive development for service users, personalization moves responsibility for care from service providers to service users, allowing the state to abdicate responsibility and, at the same time, transferring any risks associated with this; the market, meanwhile, is free to dominate the supply of care services (Cree, 2009).

Responsivity also draws on ideas of individual responsibility. The term first emerged in criminal justice literature in North America (Andrews et al., 1990). The responsivity principle suggests that the delivery of programmes of intervention should be matched to the characteristics of offenders and their needs; the relationship between the offender and his/her social worker or probation officer is identified as central to this (Whyte, 2009: 62). Proponents argue that variations in reoffending can be related principally to risk, need, and responsivity (Andrews et al., 1990). Critics, however, assert that this is oversimplistic; that programmes must take account of social and cultural contexts and must build on offenders' strengths, rather than focusing only on their weaknesses and problems (Whyte, 2009). This is a reminder that focusing on the individual and on individual responsibility is not enough; rather that issues of society and structure remain of major importance.Read more

This is a reminder that focusing on the individual and on individual responsibility is not enough; rather that issues of society and structure remain of major importance.

Family Responsibility

An idea that is as old as the idea of individual responsibility is that of family responsibility: the family is here held to be the first port of call for anyone in need. An illustration is found in the early Elizabethan Poor Laws in the UK, which stated:

It should be the duty of the father, grandfather, mother, grandmother, husband or child of a poor, old, blind, lame or impotent person, or other poor person, not able to work, if possessed of sufficient means, to relieve and maintain that person.

When people later came together to campaign for the establishment of welfare services in the UK in the early years of the twentieth century, critics argued that such provision would undermine family responsibility and make it too easy for people to abdicate their responsibilities for each other (Fraser, 2009), thus demonstrating again the close connection between ideas of individual and family responsibility.

The principle of the paramountcy of family responsibility is one that runs through all social welfare today, wherever it exists in the world. Charters that uphold individual rights are commonly prefaced by ideas of family duty. For example, the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child (1989) and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (1990) both state that parents have primary responsibility for the upbringing of their children, although, interestingly, the African charter suggests that children have responsibilities too, to their families and communities:

Every child shall have responsibilities towards his family and society, the State and other legally recognized communities and the international community (Article 31).

The idea of family responsibility is also central to world religions. For example, an Islamic prophet wrote: “Every one of you (people) is a shepherd. And every one is responsible for whatever falls under his responsibility. A man is like a shepherd of his own family, and he is responsible for them.”

The issue of family responsibility is one that, traditionally, has had particular meaning for women. Numerous feminist studies from the 1970s onward pointed out that taking responsibility for family members usually falls to women. Graham (1983) went so far as to argue that caring was a fundamental part of women's self-identity. More recently, it has been acknowledged that issues such as ‘race’/ethnicity and social class are also significant; it is often the labor of black and working-class women that allows middle-class parents to work outside the home (Graham, 2007). Research has also drawn attention to the reality that family responsibility is not, in practice, held only by parents. Grandparents and young people are also strongly implicated in family care (Gray, 2005; Cass, 2007).

Radical voices in social work in the twenty-first century have returned to the potential for misuse of the notion of family responsibility. It is argued that foregrounding family responsibility as a policy initiative allows the state and professionals to blame victims for their plight, meanwhile the structural failings of society remain obscured (see Ferguson and Woodward, 2009).

Social Responsibility

The notion of social responsibility, like that of individual and family responsibility, is an ancient one. Within the Judeo-Christian tradition, the idea that human beings are responsible for each other is found in the parable of the “Good Samaritan” (Luke 10: 29–37). This tells the story of a traveler who is beaten and robbed; the person who rescues him is not the priest or a member of his own social group but a Samaritan (Samaritans were despised by Jewish people). The parable draws us to reflect on “who is my neighbour?” The Qu'ran similarly enjoins people to look after the weak and vulnerable or else expect condemnation on the day of judgment. It asks: “Have you seen him who denies the Day of Judgement? That is he who repulses the orphan harshly and urges not on the feeding of the poor” (Qu'ran 107: 1–3).

The idea of social responsibility has taken practical form in different ways at different times. For example, Thomas Chalmers, a local clergyman, established a welfare scheme in the 1820s in the East End of Glasgow, Scotland. He withdrew his parish (local community) from statutory poor law measures and instead, instigated a system of support delivered for, and by, other community members. He believed that by removing external (state) aid, community members would take responsibility for themselves and each other. Chalmers's scheme was a source of inspiration to the Charity Organisation Society that emerged at the end of the nineteenth century in the UK and the US (Fraser, 2009). It was also demonstrated in the UK Prime Minister, David Cameron's vision of a ‘big society’:

We want to give citizens, communities and local government the power and information they need to come together, solve the problems they face and build the Britain they want. We want society – the families, networks, neighbourhoods and communities that form the fabric of so much of our everyday lives – to be bigger and stronger than ever before. Only when people and communities are given more power and take more responsibility can we achieve fairness and opportunity for all.

This is, of course, the only one way of thinking about social responsibility. The so-called ‘postwar consensus’ in the UK after the end of the Second World War illustrated a very different conceptualization. According to this, it was generally accepted that social responsibility could be relegated to the state; a new understanding promised that living standards could be improved for all through the state taking responsibility for key aspects of social life including housing, unemployment, and health. Social services meanwhile would provide a ‘safety net’ for those unable to take advantage of the mainstream services. There was an expansion of statutory social work provision from 1945 onward and the strengthening of social work as a profession. At the same time, voluntary agencies came to be seen as an ‘add-on,’ dependent on statutory agencies to pay for the services they provided (Cree, 1995; Parry and Parry, 1979). The UK today has a mixed economy of care; social responsibility is shared among the state, the voluntary sector, private providers, and individuals and families working alongside one another. There is no shared view about this (if there ever was one), and instead, arguments for and against the provision of social responsibility bubble underneath the surface all the time, erupting at key moments such as parliamentary elections and at times of social unrest and economic recession.

Other parts of the developed world such as Scandinavia have chosen a very different path toward social responsibility. Here, members of society have been willing to pay higher taxes so that there is a more generous provision of social services for all. This development has not, however, been welcomed unreservedly by all. For example, Wolfe (1989a,b) argues that a consequence of Scandinavian welfare states' high levels of responsibility for others is that individuals no longer accept personal responsibility for others; their understanding of moral responsibility, he asserts, has diminished. This viewpoint shows again the contentiousness of ideas of social responsibility, as well as the crossover with notions of moral responsibility, to be discussed more fully below.

Collective Responsibility

The idea of collective responsibility is very close to that of social responsibility, but in this case, responsibility is envisaged as held by the whole, not just by a particular social group within society. From this perspective, it might be said that a government or local authority or private sector agency is responsible, for example, for a collective failure to protect and care adequately for vulnerable people. Social workers working in a particular agency may hold individual, moral, and professional responsibility for such a failure in practice (see Ife, 2012).

Collective responsibility is not just limited to organizational responsibility, however. Writing about ‘green’ social work, Dominelli (2012) draws attention to social work's commitment as a profession that claims to intervene to enhance people's well-being. The international definition of social work also highlights this:

The social work profession promotes social change, problem solving in human relationships and the empowerment and liberation of people to enhance well-being. Utilising theories of human behaviour and social systems, social work intervenes at the points where people interact with their environments. Principles of human rights and social justice are fundamental to social work.

Adopted by the IFSW General Meeting in Montréal, Canada, July 2000, IFSW 2013

In spite of this broad claim to action, Dominelli points out that social workers have played little more than a low-key role in environmental issues that increasingly impact on people's well-being, both locally and globally, although social workers across the world continue to play a key role in the aftermath of environmental disasters, whether caused by climate change, industrial accidents, or human conflict. Shaw similarly asserts that social work must wake up to its collective responsibilities. She suggests that by failing to engage with ecological issues, our current social policies are “at best not sustainable, and at worst dangerous for our continued social well-being” (2011: 1). Social workers, she advises, have an important role to play because of social work's understanding of the interrelationship between people and the environment, and social workers' ability to integrate environmental issues into their social work practice, and advocate for vulnerable populations. This leads us readily into a discussion of moral responsibility.Read more

Terrorism, Human Rights and Ethics: A Modelling Approach

M.A. Hersh, in Improving Stability in Developing Nations through Automation 2006, 2006

2.1 Individual and Collective Responsibility

Definitions of terrorism generally define innocence in terms of a lack of involvement with the issue of concern. However, there are also issues of individual and collective responsibility. In some cases terrorists may hold groups within a state or even all citizens collectively responsible for injustices, though punishment is generally not the motivation for terrorism. However, defence against an oppressive state may require attacks on some of its members, even if they have no responsibility for the state’s oppression (Gilbert, 1994). A distinction can also be made between distributive and non-distributive collective responsibility, with distributive responsibility, also leading to individual responsibility for the consequences of decisions and nondistributive responsibility not resulting in individual responsibility. For instance, members of a government or a town council share distributive responsibility for the consequences of the decisions it makes, whereas citizens of the country or town have non-distributive responsibility. It is also sometimes claimed that citizens are responsible as a result of omissions rather than participation, for instance by failing to oppose injustices or try to rectify them. There are also issues as to whether or not ordinary citizens benefit from particular injustices (Gilbert, 1994). The issue of individual responsibility through not acting to oppose injustice or at least speaking out against it is particularly interesting. I would suggest that we all share collective responsibility for what happens both locally and in the rest of the world and that this gives us an individual responsibility to oppose injustice and to try to achieve change. How we should implement this responsibility in practice depends on a number of factors, including our own circumstances and the degree of risk. If we do not at least speak out about injustices carried out by our governments in our name and from which we may derive benefit, then it does not seem unreasonable to hold us responsible for these injustices. This leads to the questions of whether collective responsibility is the same as collective guilt and whether it is morally justifiable to punish people who can be recognised to have collective responsibility due to not having done anything to prevent injustices.Read more

Collective Guilt and Moral Responsibility

One of the ways guilt attaches to a collective is when a collective bears responsibility for a harm that has occurred. In the literature, there are two primary ways in which collective responsibility is characterized. First, collective responsibility can come via the sharing of responsibility for the same state of affairs by two or more individuals. Second, collective responsibility is sometimes characterized as the view that a nonhuman entity, a collective which is composed of human beings, bears responsibility for a state of affairs. The primary difference between these two notions is that an individual who does not bear responsibility for a state of affairs cannot be a member of a collective bearing responsibility for this state of affairs in the first sense, but it is possible for this individual to be a member of a collective bearing responsibility for it in the second sense.

The first conception of collective responsibility can be illustrated by a case in which several people deface a public building by spraying graffiti on it. Each person bears moral responsibility for a common sate of affairs, the defacing of the building, and hence they share responsibility for this state of affairs. Individuals who share responsibility for a harm do not always bear the same degree of responsibility for the harm. But when this type of collective responsibility occurs, each member of the collective bears at least some degree of responsibility.

The second conception of collective responsibility can be illustrated by a variation of the same example. Here the members of an established gang deface a public building by spraying graffiti on it. But in this example not all of the members participate in the activity. Some members spray the building, others offer words of encouragement to those spraying the building, and others simply stand and watch. Of those who stand and watch, some secretly wish that the others would stop spraying graffiti and find something else to do of a less destructive nature. However, they do not express this wish, for they do not want to risk being expelled from the gang.

In this example, it is plausible to judge that the members of the gang form a collective that bears moral responsibility for the defacing of the building. But the responsibility of the collective does not automatically distribute to all of its members, as in the case of shared responsibility. Here those members of the gang who wish that the others would stop defacing the building arguably do not bear responsibility as individuals for the defacing, for they wish that the building not be defaced. If so, then the gang could be divided into those who bear individual responsibility for the defacing of the building and those who do not. But all the members of the gang still belong to a collective that bears moral responsibility for the defacing of the building (since those who wish that the others do not deface the building are members of this collective as long as they do not in any manner express dissent to the actions of fellow gang members).

The collective that bears moral responsibility is not itself a human being, but it is composed of human beings. Of the human beings who compose it, some bear responsibility for the defacing of the building and some do not. Unlike shared responsibility, the responsibility of a collective does not invariably distribute to all of its component members. But the members can nevertheless constitute a group that bears collective guilt.

Some philosophers have held that a collective can bear moral responsibility for a state of affairs even if no member of the collective bears responsibility for the same state of affairs. D.E. Cooper proposes an example of a club that closes due to a lack of esprit de corps among its members. He argues that the members are collectively responsible for the closing, but no individual member need bear responsibility for the closing. If cases such as this are possible, and there is considerable dispute as to whether or not they are, then collective guilt is likewise possible in situations where no member of the collective is responsible for the harm producing the guilt. Then several people could bear collective guilt for a harm for which none of them bears individual moral responsibility.

Those who support the notion of collective responsibility are far more inclined to countenance cases in which at least one member of the collective bears responsibility for the outcome for which the collective itself bears responsibility. Consider the collective of German citizens during the Second World War. It has often been claimed that the German people were collectively responsible for the occurrence of the Holocaust. The vast majority of German citizens played no role in the events that led to the deaths of countless Jews, and hence they do not bear responsibility as individuals for the Holocaust. But various Nazi officials bear responsibility as individuals for the Holocaust as the result of their individual contributions to the events of the Holocaust. Accordingly, the collective of German citizens consists of some who bear responsibility and others who do not. The same is presumably true of those German citizens who experience collective guilt for the Holocaust: some but not all bear individual responsibility for it.Read more

L. Witthøfft Nielsen, in Encyclopedia of Applied Ethics (Second Edition), 2012

The outline of different ways of ascribing moral responsibility shows that traditional approaches to responsibility (i.e., individual and collective responsibility) fall short in relation to climate change. This is partly the result of uncertainty generated by the causal complexity between human activity and climate change, which makes it problematic to talk about responsibility unless it is interpreted in terms of the precautionary principle. More important, one must also consider the size and nature of the problem of climate change, which calls for a responsibility that embraces protection of the environment and human welfare and takes into account the issue of distributive justice and justice for future generations. The extent to which such a responsibility embraces protection of ecosystems and species depends on whether it is founded in an anthropocentric or an ecocentric moral approach.

Acknowledging the causality between human greenhouse gas emissions in the past and the present global warming process, it can be argued that there is a moral obligation to ensure practical adaptation and mitigation measures. Thus, the moral justification for practical adaptation and mitigation is expressed in the obligation to compensate for the harm that anthropogenic climate change causes to the environment and to human welfare and in the obligation to conserve the climate in order to ensure a sustainable development for present and future generations.Read more

An examination of governance within extended producer responsibility policy regimes in North America

Garth T. Hickle, in Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 2014

Producers, sometimes defined as brand owners, serve as the entities charged with the primary, if not sole, responsibility for financing the collection, transportation and recycling of discarded products. The operational responsibility, also referred to as functional responsibility, refers to the programmatic tasks for which the producers are responsible (Kalimo et al., 2012). These tasks may be fulfilled by individual companies, if an individual compliance option is available through the regulatory model, but are generally fulfilled through participation in a PRO. In many cases, the regulatory mechanism allows for either individual responsibility or to facilitate producer cooperation, collective responsibility.Read more

Responsibility in Social Work

Viviene E. Cree, in International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioral Sciences (Second Edition), 2015

Moral Responsibility

All types of responsibility have a moral dimension. Taking this further, moral responsibility should be understood to be the responsibility that underpins all others. Moral and ethical obligations make us responsible for ourselves, for others, for society, and for the planet.

Unsurprisingly, we find discussion of moral responsibility going back centuries. In the Bible, in Genesis 4: 1–16, after killing his brother Abel, Cain angrily asks God, “Am I my brother's keeper?” (The story of Cain and Abel is also found in Islamic tradition in the Qu'ran.) Cain's question has come to signify people's reluctance to accept responsibility for the welfare of their fellow human beings, that is, their ‘brothers,’ in the broader meaning of the term. As already highlighted, scholars such as Wolfe have argued that modern liberal democracies, such as the US and Scandinavia, have ‘broken with traditional sources of morality,’ relying instead on ‘economic and political frameworks to define their obligations to one another.’ Wolfe calls for a sense of community to be reinvigorated and with it, “a sense of obligation to the larger society” (1989b: 374). Bauman is similarly critical of what he sees as a ‘modernist’ approach to ethics, in which individual responsibility is exchanged for legislation, rules, and codes of behavior. He turns to the work of the philosopher Levinas (1985), who argues that ethics must begin with ‘the Other,’ with the knowledge that we can never fully understand or explain another person. Picking up this idea, Bauman asserts that moral relationship comes before ‘being.’ He writes, “I am a moral person because I recognize that dependence and accept the responsibility that follows …. My brother's dependence is what makes me an ethical being” (2000: 5). The first step, he argues in an earlier book, is to “take responsibility for one's responsibility” (1993: 185).

This draws us into literature on care ethics, and the work of Joan Tronto. Building on the insights of Gilligan (1982), Tronto points out that care is a practice, not a set of rules and principles; “It involves both particular acts of caring and a ‘general habit of mind’ to care that should inform all aspects of a practitioner's life” (1994: 127). Taking the example of the concept of protection, Tronto points out that the whole idea of protection demonstrates a very specific approach to human relationships; it assumes ‘bad intentions,’ in comparison with the idea of caring, which involves “taking the concerns and needs of the other as the basis for action” (1994: 104). Tronto observes that ‘care-giving’ is not necessarily the same as ‘taking care of’ someone. An individual or service may fulfill the first obligation but not the second. She identifies four ethical elements in care: attentiveness, responsibility, competence, and responsiveness, where responsibility is understood as responsibility to act and responsibility to take care. Tronto notes that parents are responsible for the care of their children, but responsibility may go far beyond this, as exemplified in the behavior of some Europeans during the Second World War when they tried to rescue Jews and others from Nazis. Tronto reminds us that assumptions of responsibility may be culturally and socially specific, impacted by gender, class, and family status. She proposes that we adopt a flexible approach to responsibility, rather than one that is rule bound and fixed for all time.Read more

The Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment of Obsessions

Mark H. Freeston, Robert Ladouceur, in International Handbook of Cognitive and Behavioural Treatments for Psychological Disorders, 1998

Exaggerated responsibility

A young university educated male was obsessed with the idea that by letting the water run while he brushed his teeth or rinsed dishes, he would be responsible for the installation of water meters on all houses.

The key assumption here is inflated personal responsibility which operates at two levels. The first refers to the individual’s use of water compared to everybody else in the town’s use of water. In fact, if everybody in the region did stop running water while brushing teeth, the savings would be considerable, but one individual’s role remains insignificant. Using a pie chart to determine the volume of water used by the individual while brushing teeth (which can be measured) compared to the volume used by industry, all the other households, watering gardens etc., will establish the respective contributions. The technique is to attribute responsibility to all other sources before looking at the individual’s remaining responsibility. Thus the idea of pivotal power is clearly erroneous: How can the minute proportion of water used by the patient influence public policy?.

The second level is to address the individual’s personal responsibility vs. the collective responsibility for rational water use: although his pivotal role was clearly erroneous, as a responsible citizen he has some degree of responsibility. However, rational water use is a collective responsibility and not an individual responsibility. Once again the pie-chart is used to accurately identify personal responsibility. Responsibility is attributed, for example, to the role of planners and policy makers (40%), the role of local government to educate people about responsible water use (15%), enforcing changes in industrial practises (25%), the role of environmental groups in raising public awareness (5%), the role of education in the schools (5%), and then finally to the 10 000 households in the town (10%) (see Figure 5.3). Thus as one of the 10 000 households and with 5 people in the household, the individual’s personal responsibility is 10% × 1/10 000 × 1/5 = 0.0002%.

An additional way to challenge this type of appraisal is for the patient to act as prosecuting attorney and/or defense attorney to argue the case. It is often more difficult for the patient to be the prosecuting attorney because usually the only evidence of guilt (i.e., responsibility) is, by emotional reasoning, their subjective feeling of guilt. The patient must instead prove his “guilt” by finding solid arguments with real empirical proof (“What are the facts?”). When the patient plays both roles, he can consider and compare two opposing points of view, thus highlighting the modifiable nature of the appraisal. The role of the therapist is to play the judge and “strike from the record” inadmissible evidence such as hearsay (“I once heard that..”) or irrational arguments.

The key to challenging responsibility appraisals is to first establish an awareness (e.g., by self monitoring) of situations where the patient takes excessive responsibility. Emotional cues such as feeling guilty or uncomfortable about something are often the best way of detecting excessive responsibility. When patients take excessive responsibility for specific events, one way of exposing the excessive nature is to transfer responsibility (on a temporary basis) to the therapist through a contract for any harm that will occur during a specified period (see Rachman, 1993). Thoughts, behavior and reactions are then monitored and compared to a similar period when the responsibility is retransferred to the patient. Another way of highlighting exaggerated responsibility is by predicting the patient’s reactions (cognitive, emotional, or behavioral) when responsibility is transferred to someone else, for example, if someone is paid a large amount to take care of the situation. The patient is asked, “would you still neutralize if you had paid $30 000 to a person for driving behind you to make sure that you had not hit someone”.Read more

An examination of governance within extended producer responsibility policy regimes in North America

Garth T. Hickle, in Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 2014

7 Producer responsibility organizations

Producer responsibility organizations (often referred to as stewardship or third-party organizations) may be either for profit or non-profit entities are a central feature of implementation of producer responsibility regimes and serve as the organizational construct for the transition to private governance. PROs as commonly understood in producer responsibility programs have historical roots in the formation of Duales System Deutschland (DSD) with enactment of the German packaging ordinance in 1991 (Nakajima and Vanderburg, 2006). The principal responsibilities of the PRO include overall program management that includes fee setting that is generally assessed on sales of products into a particular jurisdiction, selection of vendors, public outreach and education and in some cases, instituting environmentally-sound management standards (Mayers, 2007).

As Kroepelien (2000) noted, EPR creates a new entity that is inserted between the individual producer and the government. While collective compliance organizations are permitted if not, in some instances, required by the policy instrument, PROs are generally created voluntarily by the brand owners to fulfill the regulatory obligations and achieve cost efficiencies (Fleckinger and Glachant, 2010). This efficiency is, in part, attained through migrating from a system operated locally or regionally to an emphasis on a multiregional, national, or in some cases, an international scale (Mayers and Butler, 2013). It is important to recognize that PROs are often distinct from producer compliance organizations that may be operated by waste management or logistics companies and serve a functional compliance role on behalf of the producers.

PROs operate on behalf of the designated brand owners when collaborative activity is most efficient such as collection of discarded products or when individual responsibility models are inefficient or discouraged (OECD, 2001). In effect, PROs are the administrative vehicle to move from a largely competitive relationship to one that requires collaboration. PROs may function as a monopolistic compliance option or, in some cases, some of the EPR regulations provide for multiple or competitive PROs. The role of competitive schemes is often debated with an organizational monopoly suggested for jurisdictions lacking sufficient infrastructure and competition encouraged as the system matures (Antonioli and Massarutto, 2012). In some cases, as noted by Niza and colleagues (2013), collective approach is viewed as easing the implementation timeline. However, Toyasaki and colleagues (2011) argued that competitive approaches leads to lower prices of products and thus increased profits for manufacturers. It is argued that multiple PROs, while supporting a competitive landscape of compliance options, may inhibit the operational efficiencies that can be achieved within one PRO (Atasu and Wassenhove, 2012).

Critical to the construction of EPR programs, at least those that are premised on a large degree of collective action by producers, is the implementation of cooperative measures such as organizational governance and decision-making. Creating a non-state responsibility for consolidated decision-making regarding many aspects of financing and service provision is arguably the most notable feature of EPR that results in the realization of many of the intended aims of the policy tool. This support for PROs with recognition that program efficiency and interface for consumers and service providers is critical.

As individual PROs become more entrenched and functioning across multiple jurisdictions, an example PaintCare that, as of 2013, implementing unwanted paint management programs in seven U.S. states, able to accrue authority and responsibility that otherwise has been assumed by public authorities (Hickle, 2013b). Cross-jurisdictional organizations are particularly prominent in the European Union such as the European Recycling Platform (ERP) that addresses WEEE (Atasu and Wassenhove, 2012) as well as batteries. However, organizational actors such as the WEEE Forum in the EU and the Canadian Shares Services Alliance (CSAA) in Canada serve a coordination, reporting, and support function role for multiple PROs. As Bury (2013) noted, the producers are steering efforts to promote program consistency across jurisdictions and operate programs with a national perspective.

The actual governance mechanism of the organization, such as the composition of the board of directors or other administrative body, is determined by the obligated brand owners. In some instances such as the Rechargeable Battery Recycling Corporation in the United States, two board seats are reserved for independent directors with no organization affiliation with producers of batteries. The Carpet America Recovery Effort (CARE), the organization executing the brand owner obligations required by the producer responsibility measure enacted in California in 2010, has representation on the board from independent processors of collected carpet. PROs that have been created for compliance with packaging regulations typically have a diversity of producers, including those representing different materials, represented in the governance structure of the organization.

PROs are often formed and initially housed within traditional industry trade associations. Examples of this pattern of origination include PaintCare that was created by the American Coatings Association in the U.S. and Multi-Material British Columbia (MMBC), an entity formed by several trade associations representing retailers and brand owners in Canada. The genesis and arrangement of PROs is often diverse, as Hage (2007) states in an analysis of the producer responsibility system in Sweden, producers initiated four separate organizations by commodity type.

Despite the emphasis on flexibility for program implementation within the EPR conceptual framework, certain EPR regulations require obligations to be executed by a PRO and compel individual producers to join the organization. For example, the architectural paint producer responsibility law in the State of Connecticut (Connecticut Legislature, 2012) requires mandatory participation by producers in a PRO. In some case, such as is the case with the statute for EPR for carpet in California, the Carpet America Recovery Effort is explicitly identified in the statute (California Legislature, 2010). In some instances, the management organization may be actually created by the legislation as exemplified by the Washington Materials Management Authority Washington Materials Management Authority (WMMA), an organization specifically created by the authorizing statute (Gui et al., 2013). The WMMA performs many of the functions of a traditional PRO with a board predominantly composed of brand owners but also has the state regulatory authority serving in an ex officio capacity. As of 2012, no brand owners are operating an independent plan.

While many programs are premised on producer collaboration, concerns regarding monopolistic behavior have been present with PROs since their inception. For example, several of the state statutes in the United States instituting producer responsibility measures contain an anti-trust exemption from state competition laws to facilitate brand owner cooperation (Hickle, 2013a).Read more
