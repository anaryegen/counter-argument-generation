what separates a religion from a cult?

It seems that cults are characterized by their culture of isolation and exclusivity, worship of a single being or object, and collection of atypical beliefs. The general definition of religion is that it is a set of attitudes, beliefs and practices relating to the metaphysical. (I might be wrong here) If we were to go by that definition, then couldn't cults be considered a religion? Especially given how incredibly subjective it is at the end of the day. And it precisely fits the definition. Or are cults simply a subset of the term "religion?"

I think that the different technical uses, and therefore meanings, of the word "cult" are a source of a lot of the confusion when trying to define what a "cult" is in the vernacular.

The meaning that u/thesweeterpeter starts with (a "cult" being a subset of a wider religious system) is a way of describing, for example, a group within a polytheistic tradition that places great focus on one figure or deities (or small number of deities). Ancient greek polytheism would be a religion, while the Elusinian Mysteries (which put much spiritual emphasis on Demeter and Persephone, including the latter's undworld descent and return) would be a cult in this sense. In an adjacent sense, "cult" can refer to practices, objects and rituals concerning one deity in particular: the cult of a given deity would amount to the worship of them specifically, rather than in a context of alongside other deities figures. i.e. a person can be of a polytheist religion, and the specifics of which gods they worship primarily, or the local practices they adhere to, would be the "cult" they belong to within that religion (analagous to "denomination")

In the other, often perjoritive, sense; "cult" refers to a socially harmful or manipulative sect or minority religion. Which may or may not overlap with the previous use of the word "cult", either accurately or inaccurately (e.g. innaccurate due to ignorance or bias), attempting to identify the particular group as both senses of the word. The BITE model is a popular tool for identifying "cults" in this sense that are socially harmful or manipulative groups, religious or otherwise.

There is an element of the colloquial use of the word "cult" that implies "a religious group with false beliefs", which is an unhelpful addition to the often already blended meaning. The Moonies might be correct in their religious beliefs, but still a "cult" as defined under BITE. Likewise, the early Christian movement was arguably a "cult" in the sense that it was a minority messianic "sect" of Judaism, regardless of whether or not Jesus was considered divine or if the early churches held "true beliefs".

TLDR depends what sense you use the word "cult" in.

"Cult" has at least four different definitions: (1) the worship or veneration of a particular deity/saint/etc; (2) part of a value-neutral sociological classification of religious groups (cult vs sect vs church vs ecclesia); (3) a negative term for groups which are viewed as psychologically/socially harmful; (4) a negative term for groups which are viewed as having wrong theology.

Few people seem to be aware of sense (2), unless they've taken a particular interest in sociology of religion. Sense (3) is the most popular sense. Sense (4) is predominantly associated with conservative Protestants. Sense (1) is somewhat old-fashioned.

Sense (2) works like this: a sect is a religious group with high tension with surrounding society, but traditional beliefs; a cult is a religious group with high tension with surrounding society, but novel beliefs; a church is a religious group with low tension with the surrounding society, but which doesn't dominate it; an ecclesia is a religious group which dominates its society (such as a state religion). This classification is an expansion of one originally due to Weber. The term "cult" in this scheme is meant non-judgementally and in a value-neutral way, there is no implication that cults are bad or harmful or so on. What counts as "novel beliefs" is relative to a society, so the same group can be a cult in some societies but not in others – a good example of this is the Hare Krishnas (ISKCON), which by this definition is a "cult" in Western countries, but either a "sect" or a "church" in its native India.

Thank you! Curious - what about the conservative Protestants is usually believed to be cultish in the sense that they have the wrong theology?

I like Hassan's BITE model to get a good idea, the gist of it is that cults are about control to the level that you police yourself on behalf of the in group. The model also allows for secular cults like political cults of personality.

The degree of control they have over their members, especially thought control, social control, & physical control. Many religions have obligations that they require their followers to uphold but only cults forbid their followers from questioning religious doctrine & have direct control of what their followers do. Cults are very authoritarian in nature.

You assume that cults are always religious, but cults can also be political or ideological, such as environmentalist. However, I agree there is a continuum.

Cults usually require you to renounce your wealth, move, and they usually see the rest of the World as evil. Religions do can believe the world is evil, but that is different from believing everyone else is like a demon trying to destroy you.

Most cults are not dangerous, though. They don't end up in suicide or similar, but the fact they can pull that trigger shows how much power they have over their members.

I find it interesting nationalism, communism and dying-for-your country stuff often has such cultish things, even dying for a cause, but rarely considered as such.

Yes, many denominations and "religious orders" within religions clearly has cultish behaviour. I wonder why the label of cult is often reserved to relatively isolated religions, since those groups can be as dangerous and as isolated, they just extend the religion they are contained in.

The cult of personality of politicians in America seems to be more like the Celebrity cult. They usually may not as extreme to cause death directly, but they do affect election outcomes, public perception of the parties and candidate, etc. It is indeed dangerous.

Traditionally cults can exist within a religion as the cult is a devotion to a specific figure. That is to say one may have or does believe in the Roman pantheon of God's, but specifically belongs to the cult of Venus.

I think we've started to use the word cult more to distinguish the interpretation of a dangerous or strange religion - ie Branch Davidians, or People's Temple. But this is a subjective way of defining those religions, there are some who would argue those are legitimate religions.

It gets more complicated with something like Scientology when we have a lot of the hallmarks of those more strange modern religions, and arguably dangerous; ie secrecy, modern knowable diety [Hubbard], vast sums of follower money, etc. But scientology is a religion not a cult (even the IRS says so).

So then as we stretch it, can't I put larger centralized religions into the same bucket? For example, The catholic church in a similar status as the Roman religion, but instead of a cult to Venus, they have the order of Franciscan, a cult to St Francis? Or if we look a Judaism, with its multitude of ways of practise and lack of centralization, are each of those a cult?

Interesting to say the IRS defines Scientology as a religion. I don't disagree that the IRS position may be that it is a religion, but I don't think tax code in the USA is a reasonable arbiter. Certainly it is worth pointing out, as you have done here. To my point though, it would be very easy for anyone in the USA to establish a religion or church and receive tax treatment as such. Established religion and churches in the US can easily be scams without being investigated as such by the IRS. That doesn't mean a scam religion or church is a cult, but my point is that political acceptance (i.e., absence of societal tension) is a useful indicator of cult-or-religion in the USA.

Scientology went to war with the IRS to preserve that status - much less it's not the evidence I'm hanging my arguement on, I put it in parentheticals because it's a minor piece of evidence. If you're interested in the tumultuous relationship that specific religion has had with tax authorities, dig into the period of about 1960 to the early 90's of what the scientology did to the IRS - and they won.

, it would be very easy for anyone in the USA to establish a religion or church and receive tax treatment as such.

It's not difficult to establish a religion, many have done it. The IRS isn't the only arbiter, many countries have their own version of regulating via the tax codes. Take for example Germany who de-moted the tax status of scientology because of the danger it poses as an entity. Instead they view it as a business and tax it thusly.

But there are plenty of much smaller examples, like the The Church Universal and Triumphant - who similar to the Branch Davidians had stockpiled weapons and really built a religion around for their militia based origins - they were tax exempt, it was revoked, but then similar to scientology had their status reinstated with out of court settlements with the IRS.

I'd argue they are very much a cult, but they are tax exempt.

The difference between religion and cult it more about perspective than behaviour. Opus Dei I'd argue is a cult within the Roman catholic assembly, but they are also an officially recognized "personal prelature" - whatever that means.

All of this is to say, I too disagree that tax code, especially that of one specific nation, is the reasonable arbiter of defining an organization as a religion not a cult - but then what is? When it comes down to it, aren't the legal entities overseeing the regulation of religious bodies under their jurisdiction the only effectively consistent way we have?

Yes, pretty much all cults are religions. And most religions have some elements of a cult. The bite model lists typical cult like behaviours and is a good measure of how much a certain religion can be considered a cult

I should point out that the "BITE model" is based on the definition of "cult" as "psychologically/socially destructive religious group". That's different from the sociological definition of "religious group with high tension with surrounding society, but novel beliefs". In terms of academic origins, the former definition has been promoted by (certain) psychologists, whereas the later definition comes from sociology. Psychologists seem to have been far more successful than sociologists in getting the general public to pay attention to their theories here – many people are afraid of "destructive"/"harmful" groups, relatively few are interested in a classification of religious groups which intentionally aims at being non-judgemental and value-neutral, and is mainly associated with descriptive theories about how religious groups grow and spread and change and shrink over time.

Numbers - and to some extent age.

I can't think of any cult not being considered a religion if it had enough followers. However, there aren't many Zoroastrians and nobody calls them a cult. I think they get some deference because of age.

I agree with this explanation. It's just size and age. In a sense, age is size in this context. Zoroastrianism many not have a huge number of followers today, but given that it's one of the world's oldest organized religions, the total number of Zoroastrians who have ever lived is no doubt quite high.

I think if it's a specific portion of the population that adheres to a belief, then it no longer is called a cult and is a religion. That's always how I looked at it. Small groups of religious ideology out of a larger religious framework, like splinter cells.

But, Technically all religions are cults, it's just the negative stereotypes linked to cults usually means, a smaller minority of religious zealots fighting or believing in a sometimes radical far right or left position within the broader religious community. By labeling it a cult identifies to the larger secular community as a whole, it's dangerous.

Basically, Christianity is a working example of this historically without the confines of human beings' beliefs.

Sorry if I'm misinterpreting it, but are you suggesting that it simply depends on its social popularity?

Sorry if I'm misinterpreting it, but are you suggesting that it simply depends on its social popularity?

Well, as the term "cult" is defined in sociology of religion, social popularity is a big part of it. Sects and cults are by definition groups which have high tension with mainstream society. A sufficiently popular group isn't going to have high tension with mainstream society, because it is big enough to help define the mainstream – which means it must be a church or ecclesia rather than a sect or cult.

I'm trying to make a distinction that in modern times the idea of a "cult" in the Western Culture is used in a negative and derogatory way compared to say ancient times.

And rightfully so, media coverage on Wacko and Jonestown, sharing the atrocities with the world, really made the word cult a measuring tape for groups of people that hold counter to popular more accepted beliefs.

If I can give an example, one that is often cited as a cult within the Christian community would be the Church of God, or some of their member churches anyway where members tend to be withdrawn from society except to preach, quit jobs, indoctrinate family members. Most Churches do not have this kind of a grip on the day to day life of their members. That is where it differs.

Nothing. All religions are cultus, culture, cultivation. The malign/benign distinction is spurious when you take stock of the massive harms arising from patriarchy and patriarchal religion.

Religions are successful, cults aren't.

What separates a religion from a cult?

A special pleading fallacy.

What separates a religion from a mythology

The answer to that is, also, a special pleading fallacy

In my opinion, a religion worships a deity, a cult worships the man.

Christianity, in my opinion, is turning more and more into a cult because they are starting to care more about what the pope says rather than the actual holy book.

That's just my opinion tho, i am an atheist, to me religion of cult is nonsense either way.

What if I was a cult member, and argued that the leader I worship IS the being, or the embodiment of the being, himself? Especially since it's so subjective and there's no way I can prove or disprove it

You are still worshipping the man, not a superior entity.

So were Mormons a cult when Joseph Smith was still alive?

I mean, the guy tried to start cults and crystal based faiths way before mormonism, so yeah, definetly a cult he managed to start.

Not sure what they believe in now, or the general religion, but i have the story of how it started.

What’s the basis for your claim that Christians today are “starting to care more about what the pope says rather than the actual holy book”?

I think if you look at the historical record, you’ll find the pope has had a dramatic decline in influence over Christian life in the last 500 years.

I started another thread here, and from that you can clearly see how people all have their own ideas about what's the religion is actually about.

Traditions are different between regions and countries, and ideas too.

And, i am italian, when the pope says ANYTHING they talk about it for months on tv and even in service at the church.

The pope recently even changed an old prayer, because he declared that "god doesn't tempt us, the devil does", and the prayer said "don't tempt us", now it says "don't abandon us to temptation".

How is that not listening to the person rather than the deity?

My point is that the pope was vastly more powerful a few centuries ago when he had a much greater monopoly on worldwide Christianity and when church and state were intertwined in many more countries than today.

Are you familiar with the history of the Protestant Reformation? A much smaller share of Christians listen to the pope today than did in 1500.

I think if you look at the historical record, you’ll find the pope has had a dramatic decline in influence over Christian life in the last 500 years.

Not to mention that the authority of the Pope as universal on the church came centuries later when Christianity gave authority to Bishops instead Apostles. But yes, I agree religions when they start have come cultish behaviour. But cults are not bad for being cults, but for the power they have on people.

The usual rules regarding a cult definition don’t seem to apply anymore.

It’s basically a perception thing and the religion being called a cult usually has no reason to consider itself that.

Other than the possibility of separation is that of benevolence and malevolence, nothing.

“A cult is a group I don’t respect.

A religion is a group I do respect”

Many other commenters have pointed out the BITE model as a good tool for distinguishing harmful, high control groups from (for instance) new religious movements. Another tool with this goal is the ABCDEF — the cult danger evaluation frame. While it has fewer criteria than the BITE model, it has people score each item on a 1-10 scale. I find that approach helpful because there can be huge variation in the level of control for a particular item. For instance, dietary restrictions are common in many religions, but there is a big difference between a simple prohibition (don’t drink alcohol) that is primarily enforced through people’s own conscience, and the group in Kenya that convinced/manipulated/coerced 100+ people to literally fast themselves to death.

Cults don’t allow dissent and are often an echo chamber.

Sadly cult-like mindset and behaviors even exist among major world religions today…

Using the popular sense and ignoring all the other senses, I'd say that for religions of cult origin the difference is one of degree. A religion of cult origin has had time and contact wear down the control wielded by the leader(s) to the point that the membership can function normally enough. Not all religions are of cult origin, so this doesn't apply to all of them.

Michael Shermer writes about Ayn Rand Objectivism as a rational cult. He lists these characteristics of a cult.

Veneration of the Leader: Excessive glorification to the point of virtual sainthood or divinity.

Inerrancy of the Leader: Belief that he or she cannot be wrong.

Omniscience of the Leader: Acceptance of beliefs and pronouncements on virtually all subjects, from the philosophical to the trivial.

Persuasive Techniques: Methods used to recruit new followers and reinforce current beliefs.

Hidden Agendas: Potential recruits and the public are not given a full disclosure of the true nature of the group’s beliefs and plans.

Deceit: Recruits and followers are not told everything about the leader and the group’s inner circle, particularly flaws or potentially embarrassing events or circumstances.

Financial and/or Sexual Exploitation: Recruits and followers are persuaded to invest in the group, and the leader may develop sexual relations with one or more of the followers.

Absolute Truth: Belief that the leader and/or group has a method of discovering final knowledge on any number of subjects.

Absolute Morality: Belief that the leader and/or the group have developed a system of right and wrong thought and action applicable to members and nonmembers alike. Those who strictly follow the moral code may become and remain members, those who do not are dismissed or punished.

Your contemplation on the relationship between cults and religion is indeed a fascinating inquiry into the shades of human belief. The characteristics you ascribe indeed evoke an air of exclusivity. However, the distinction between cults and religions remains a matter of debate, partly due to the multifaceted and subjective nature of religion itself. Some argue that cults embody distinct qualities that set them apart from established religions, others posit that cults may simply represent a subset within the vast tapestry of religious practices. The intricate interplay between cults and religions invites us to go further into the intricate contours of human faith, where the lines between these categories become tantalizingly blurred.

Historically and etymologically, all religions are cults. The word "religion" only appears in the 11th century.

Before that, everything we now call religion was called a cult, or more precisely a cultus: a system or variety of religious worship. (Oxford Dictionary).

"Cult" revived in the early 19th century, referring to primitive systems of religious belief and worship, especially the rites and ceremonies employed in such worship.

Extended meaning "devoted attention to a particular person or thing" is from 1829.

Religions are cults, cults are religions or subcultures of religions. They can marry of little girls in a Christian cult called the children of G-d while they do the exact same thing in Afghanistan, while that might not be seen as a cult but just seen as their CULTure. Just like the church asks you for money, just like the hasidics separates themselves from society.

I'm not convinced that there is an easy to draw line that separates them, honestly.

I mean, I think my religion is valid and others are invalid, but obviously people of all other religions would disagree with me. I suppose one difference between some cults and what I'd consider legitimate religious groups would be leaders' motivations and beliefs. Does the religion's leadership actually believe what they are preaching, or did they make up something to try to manipulate people in some way? The problem with this definition is that there are some pretty extreme groups out there that many would consider cults, where the leaders genuinely do believe what they're preaching, as crazy as it may seem. They could be mentally ill, or they could have just grown up in the belief system, and maybe the original "manipulator" is long dead and the cult has now passed down beliefs for generations. But who is to say for sure that there wasn't some dishonest manipulating person thousands of years ago behind the more mainstream religions? So I don't think there is a good way to separate them.

That definition does not seem accurate to me. You're saying in part that a cult worships a 'single being'. Since God is a single being wouldn't that classify his worship as cultish? He himself says he exacts exclusive devotion.

Christianity isn’t polytheistic. Pretty much what that’s saying is not do dabble in idolatry and deify people, things, or ideas, considering he’s the only God from this perspective. That’s like your kid praising Santa Clause for the gifts while being oblivious.
