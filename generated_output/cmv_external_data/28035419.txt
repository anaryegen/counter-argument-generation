New research quantifies the emotional impact of music on advertising

Comprehensive 12 month research project by SoundOut and Goldsmiths, University of London, quantifies subconscious impact of music, measures the correlation to the conscious response, and provides a robust testing framework for brands and marketeers

Sound modulates the subconscious emotional response to advertising by up to 16.4%

Music is particularly powerful in changing the emotional response for some emotional attributes – like Peaceful, Intense and Defiant – but less so for others – like Technical, Spontaneous and Simple

Primary research underpinned by over 600,000 consumer responses and 10 million consumer data points
