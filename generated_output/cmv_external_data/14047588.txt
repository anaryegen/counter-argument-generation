Can The Regression Of A Character Arc Be... Good?

This is going to sound kind of odd from the outset.

Our whole conceptial idea of storytelling and the growth of characters is that they always need to progress, and that someone's arc establishes a new equilibrium for them - whether thats breaking out of their persona, a facade or facing personal strife. We find that satisfying for a story.

However can the opposite also be true? Can the regression of a character back to their previous state give a similar sense of catharsis or satisfaction?

The main example I'm asking for is if a character's arc or their main trait is something such as loyalty. One way to take it, is a way if growth - they grow past the loyalty to a singular entity and instead grow to become loyal to a host of things. The other is potentially more damaging - they double down on that loyalty until it becomes obsessive, their only driving force.

In that case have they regressed as a character or grown? And is it satisfying and logical?

Can this kind of idea, of a character returning back to their previous state, make for a compelling character or story with the right foreshadowing and pretext? Or is it just a horrible idea that is destined to fail.

I'm flip flopping between two ideas of a character arc for a protagonist in my story and would simply like to hear other peoples people's opinions.

Thank you in advance. Share

I mean, it's the story of the person who loves they're friends but then go and become famous and rich and become absorbed by it until they realise how shallow they're existence is and then try to go back.

Hmm how or even could you spin it to the point where they don't go back? Is that just the creation of an antagonistic personality/anti-hero or is just a boring and shallow concept?

Honestly? A character reversal is something that undermines any development we've seen, so it lacks the given satisfaction of your average character arc.

And about my specific example? Maybe the character enjoys his villainy? Maybe his good-naturedness came from being powerless and maybe their new self is who they always were? They could be a lesson on the endemic evils of society and how good and bad are human justifications for the cruelty of the powerful and meekness of the weak.

Yea that was my main worry. Perhaps if its foreshadowed enough, that whatever path the character walks down it'll lead to that same obsessive road? But then again, you are right in that aspect. Although... then it raises the question of do we need satisfaction in order to still understand a character - thats getting a bit into flimsy justification territory though.

Thank you for your response!

No that's an interesting question. Can a character arc be interesting without being satisfying? Failed redemptions can work. But these tend to be more "shock value" than legitimately good. They're great the first time, because your expectations were thrown for a loop and you feel bad. But upon re-reading, it just nullifies whatever section of story was spent building that arc up.

This is how sitcoms work. It’s very common.

Thats true. His often does that translate to a satisfying or understandable conclusion though? Like does it make you feel exhausted afterwards or does it still feel reearding in its own twisted way

One of the best examples or even twists of this arc is in Bojack Horseman. I'd really reccomend you watch it. Since it carries themes alcoholism and depression it makes sense that some characters relapse or regress, as you put it. It's seriously something to behold, if done well, the circular arc is one of the most interesting, I think.

It's a fairly common thing.

In a conventional story you can use it to show that the character isn't ready yet or that the events of the story are too much for him. He's built himself up to where he seems like he's ready to take on the world, but a series of setbacks or betrayals or tempations make him lose confidence and all of a sudden things are looking pretty grim for him. Tension galore!

And in a tragedy, well, it can be the driving force of the entire plot. He loses his confidence, or he falls back on bad habits, or he thinks he's too badass to need the discipline he's learned, or he compromises his hard-won ideals, and the whole rest of the story is about the terrible consequences that come after he reached his personal peak and decided to come back down from it for whatever reason.

You remember Jaime Lannisters character arc. Dont do that.

I could see something like this from the point of view for a tragedy or a horror novel. Otherwise...

Think of it more like progressing in the opposite direction.

There's a difference between returning where you started and resetting to where you started. In the former case you evolved and progressed, but in the later you legit lost everything since last time you where at that point.

Hm okay so its not necessarily a case of going back to a previous mindset or q characteristic being bad, and more of a 'if it comes out of nowhere without a reason or leason behind it then its bad and a detriment'? Even if not, you've helped me understand this aspect a bit better so thank you

Yes, try to compare the character when he entered that state for the first time with when he entered it for the second time.

If they're not absolutely identical then they didn't regress. They have experienced new stuff that made them go back to where they started. They might even have a different reason for being at the same place.

So even when at first it seems like nothing changed, they actually had to endure quite the journey to return at their prior mindset. That's progression. And I do believe that's interesting.

I think something that makes a character change is simply progression regardless of how they do it, Dutch and Arthur from RDR2 are a prime example of this over the course of the game, Arthur becomes a bad guy who does good things, Dutch becomes a good guy who does bad things.

I think so long as your story characters don't end exactly the same as they started then any sort of growth, good or bad is fine.

Write a sitcom where the plot never progresses and this will be a fine approach. Otherwise people get frustrated.

I'm actually writing a story with that concept. Long story short, an ex-criminal is posed with a new problem, one that actually looks in line with his new straight-laced persona. Time goes on, and he starts realizing that his old criminal mentality is a lot more effective, and technically becomes a worse person as the problem gets solved. I suppose his arc wobbles, as he picks a third option in the end, but much of the story is about regressing and accepting that not all things done for evil are evil things, and vice versa.

I really like the idea of a character struggling to change for the better, but they're exposed to something that just flips a switch and they revert to their old ways. Like an assassin that swears off killing, but then they're forced to in self defense or something, and they get a rush of satisfaction and go dark mode. I'm also thinking of Wreck-it Ralph. For some reason.

This is basically the structure of the classical tragedy.

Character has a virtue that, through pride in that virtue, he pursues to his own downfall.

If you believe that stories exist to educate/enlighten as well as to entertain, it's a natural step to say that character arcs--whether progressing or regressing--serve as the example by which you are enlightening/educating.

That's called a tragedy, Hamlet, Othello, king Lear, Twilight, Romeo and Juliet. The protagonists of all of these stories are brought down by their tragic flaw, their Hemartia.

While classically tragedies are tied to negative characteristics, like hubris, greed, lust, wrath, vengeance, and so on. All a tragic fall really needs to be is something acts as core part of the character that leads to their death, disgrace and/or what ever horrible thing that happens to them. Which includes warping traditionally good characteristics and warping them into something negative.

Characters who arc's are regressing are often refereed to as falling Arcs and declining Arcs.

That’s basically what breaking bad is about.

Yeah it can work. For example: Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Logan, Bojack Horseman season 6
