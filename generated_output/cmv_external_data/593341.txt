Large cost variations of liver transplantation are reported. The aim of this study was to assess cost differences of liver transplantation and clinical follow-up between the United States and other Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. Eight electronic databases were searched, and 2,000 citations published after 1990 with more than 10 transplantations, and with original cost data, were identified. A total of 30 articles included 5,975 liver transplantations. Meta-analysis was used to derive a combined mean using a random-effects model to test for heterogeneity between studies. Estimated mean cost of a U.S. liver transplantation was US$163,438 (US$145,277-181,598) compared to US$103,548 (US$85,514-121,582) for other OECD countries. Patient characteristics, disease characteristics, quality of the health care provider, and methodology could not explain this cost difference. Health system characteristics differed between the U.S. and other OECD countries. Cost differences in liver transplantation between these two groups may be largely explained by health system characteristics.
