CMV: Painting one's face black should not be considered "blackface" when not depicting a black person

In light of the Covington Catholic press that has arisen recently, I've seen various outlets and individuals calling the involved individuals racist and citing to a popularly-shared picture from a basketball game depicting several students painted jet black. For additional context, here is a video of them engaged in dressing up in various colors for athletic events, with students painted fully black, white, and blue. I've come across arguments about whether "blacking out" for a sporting event by painting yourself (including your face) constitutes "blackface" and is racist as a result. My position is that painting one's face should not be considered "blackface" when it is specifically done in a manner that does not depict a black person. Now, I will admit that, particularly given the potential for backlash over painting yourself black, it is unwise to do so. However, whether it is unwise or not is separate from whether it is or should objectively be considered wrong (as objective as something can be in this context).

I have seen advanced arguments that any time someone paints their face, it is blackface and racist. This the specific claim that I am opposing. I think that by taking such an absolute position is unwise. Moreover, anytime I see someone try to make the point that there can be distinctions, they often are met with reactionary "you're a racist" arguments. By failing to acknowledge legitimate instances where there could be exceptions, and by shutting down any useful dialogue about the topic, I think we're potentially mislabeling innocuous behavior and demonizing people for attempting to engage in useful political dialogue about a relevant topic. Hence, me having to use a throwaway account for fear of potential backlash.

Note that I am not looking to argue whether or not the Covington Catholic students actually are racist or whether wearing blackface is racist when trying to "honor" a black person (e.g., Luann de Lesseps' Diana Ross costume).

EDIT: Stepping away to return to work, but I'll attempt to reply to everyone once I get a chance.

At the heart of your argument is a point that I don't think can be rationally debated. Racism is belief, or maybe better called here an idea, where painting your self black is an action. You can most assuredly create a contrived set of circumstances where the action of painting yourself black has no tie to racism. A silly example perhaps might be that someone is playing a game of hide and seek and would like to blend in with a black background. In this case, the action of painting their face black betrays no racist values in their thinking. The only belief being expressed by this action is that if i become darker I will become harder to see and have an advantage at this game. While that is a silly case, it shows that there is not an objective link between the action and idea.

However, The above logic is in a vacuum. It is devoid of the context of the culture we are in currently. Using the same example above, when the person above is making a decision to paint them selves they must also consider why not to do something as well. While the intention is purely innocent, any person whose head isn't under a rock is going to know about how touchy the subject of blackface really is. Continuing with the plan in spite of the risk is where the logic of your view begins to break down. Even when you are painting your face black for benign reasons you are actively disregarding the feelings of the people who find it offensive. They know that you know that they don't like it when white people paint them selves black and they see that you have done it anyways. What does this lead them to believe about you?

Let me use another analogy that should be fairly (apologies for the pun) Black and White. Imagine if you will, a man who hangs a Swastika on the front door of his house. Everyone is town thinks he is a Nazi sympathizer but, as it turns out, he only has the swastika because he likes the way it looks. Yes, He has received complaints from his Jewish neighbors but still refuses to take it down on the grounds that he isn't pro-nazi and the symbol was originally a symbol of piece. Is his rational correct? Yes. Is he still being insensitive? Yes. By leaving up the swastika, he is asserting that his right to decorate is more important than the suffering of the Jewish people during WW2. He is devaluing them by claiming this thing that is very important to them to be less important than his decoration choices. That, IS racism, intentional or not.

Translating into the sporting event, perhaps these students weren't actively trying to be racist, but they did disregard the general stance on blackface. That disregard is showing that they feel that racial sensitivity is less important than their right to freely choose a costume for a basketball game. This disrespect of an entire race's feeling on the grounds that its fun to do IS racism. Whether these students are actively racist is something I am not looking to argue either. I can't assert one way or the other whether or not it was intentional racism without them coming forward and providing context.

So to summarize and clarify; Blackface is not only racist when it is being done to mock black people. Even when done with other motivations the act of ignoring the very public standard of blackface being taboo shows an underlying racist belief that the concerns of black people are inherently less important.

Edit: Cleaned up some sloppy grammar.

I would like to ask something, because it appears that this vitriol is seeping into general public thought where I am now living, and it is a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy.

For instance, my mother recently found photos of us when we were younger. I was dressed as Allen iverson, and my brother was a soldier. He was wearing camo paint and I am clearly wearing black face-paint, in order to look more like my idol, because that is the goal of the dress up.

My sister told my mum to delete the photo immediately, even though we are kids, dressing up, and my brothers camo paint makes it look like we are both in what I now know is ‘black face’. Now I can see a situation where someone would call me out on that, and it would be built into a scenario whereby people would get offended by the scenario.

But, if people ignored the photo, if it were not given the attention it hypothetically received, then no one would have ever been offended by it, and that innocent act would have been left in isolation as a young kid trying to be more like his idol.

My friend recently put on too much fake tan to dress as Tom jones and everyone was calling him James Jones, he ended up leaving because people were taking photos and calling him out on it.

In those scenarios, who is actually being insensitive? Who is in the wrong? Because the innocent action would have carried on being innocent until it made contact with someone outwardly willing to be offended by it.

This is not a rare case. And people love getting offended, it gives them a chance to talk about themselves without a chance of anyone calling them out, but can’t we apply some moral thinking here. Just because someone is offended doesn’t mean you are wrong. It doesn’t even mean you’re being insensitive. Ignorant, too is the wrong word because it implies an almost wilful avoidance. There are many different words for it, but realistically it is on the person who is offended to explain why, why they chose that battle line to stand on.

This stuff really bothers me because I try to be good and kind and I also try to have fun, and there are things that I will say that I don’t mean that someone else will take offence to. They can call me out on that then and there, but instead they will wait and write about it later. A photo is the perfect example of this, because it captures a moment, nothing more or less, and provides zero context beyond what the viewer applies to it themselves.

And after someone is out through the internet wash room, there’s no chance their rebuttal gets the same attention, because people who are at home not meeting real people, watching the consequences of their actions and words in real time.

There is no incentive to return to a comment after you have been proven wrong, there are no repercussions, there is only the next comment to spout your (in your mind) correct opinions and the only thing that separates the trend of the thread is how many people read your comment first, not the validity of it.

This isn’t a nazi symbol with Jewish neighbours. That is not a valid example. This is people who are literally cosplaying. I would be amazed. Actually, genuinely amazed if any real racist had dressed in black face. That would, you would think, be something they inherently abhor and despise. They wore white sheets for a reason.

There are definitely cases of perfectly innocent blackface. Both of your examples seem to fit. The photo of you as kid is blackface but you are doing to idolize not to mock. And it seems like your friend was in literally in accidental blackface.

These are innocent in intention, and most people can see that. The problem arises when someone does get offended by it. The reaction of the 'perpetrator' will reveal any insensitivity. If the response to the picture being criticized is to proudly display in spite of the criticism that is insensitive. To say IDGAF about accidentally tanning a few shades too dark is insensitive. To apologize, recognize the discomfort and explain why the picture/costume was well meaning would be to stay respectful of the feelings of the people experiencing discomfort.

You are very right about people loving to get offended. The people who are professionally offended are jumping at the chance to feel faux-righteous anger and the are going to look for things to be offended by and are going to twist facts to fit their narratives. Catering to them isn't within the bounds of reason. You can show them a base level of respect but beyond that their desperate ramblings should be shouldn't be considered when deciding how to act.

i mostly agree with you, but i'm a little confused by this... "the reaction of the 'perpetrator' will reveal any insensitivity", and yet the nature of viral mob justice is that reactions are, unless even more inflammatory, rarely viral too, so a person may react in exactly the way you are describing and the majority of people will never ba aware of this, and so the 'perpetrator' will continuously shout their sorrows to the winds and they won't catch.

you then go onto say that 'catering to them isn't within the bounds of reason'... so my question to you is t what stage does someone become professionally offended?

because if something happens in australia, argentina, where the history is shocling when it comes to indigenous cultures but there's no minstrel/blackface history to learn of, i posit that it is not reasonable for even a black north american to be offended by a person doing black face at a private party, in north america. if a person has an understanding of the audience that will receive their statement or joke, they are not being insensitive by catering to that scenario. they can be being racist, that shit is most often behind closed doors. but it's not offensive to anyone, until the photos are shared, until people choose to get outraged by it.

what we literally, literally cannot do is know whether something will be considered offensive by the billions of people on the internet. we also have no control over what will be offensive in 10, 20 and especially 50 years.

so we adapt and apologise and cater to every whim in order to not insult anyone and eventually, well... shit isn't fun anymore.

in 50 years i'll bet you 500 dollars we will get shat on for eating actual meat. with the way things are going, it will probably be less than that.

Sorry for the delay!

I'm going to award a delta for a change in my stance. I believe that you were the first one (or perhaps the one who did so best) to comment to the effect of "disregarding others' discomfort with black face paint in order to pursue your own personal satisfaction is implicitly racist." While I foresee practical issues in drawing the line at where that rule extends (i.e., at what point is one justified in saying a given person's discomfort is unreasonable), I think that the nexus between Blackface and painting one's face black is sufficiently close that it's reasonable to apply that line of thought here. For the sake of clarity, an example of an opinion that I think goes too far is someone saying that using black painted lettering on the face of a clock is blackface, so anyone doing so is being racially insensitive. That being said, I think debating where that line may exist is another discussion entirely, and one that is outside the scope of the argument at stake here.

Anyway, thanks for your comment. !delta

I agree wholeheartedly with your point about practicality. Some people are professionally offended and it is not within the bounds of reason to cater to their sensibilities.

Similar to another post I commented on, I'm tagging this to return to for more discussion, possibly a delta. Thanks for the detailed response!

Do you not think that picture is depicting blackface?

My initial response was “holy shit that’s horrible”. Then I thought about the context of a sporting event. Then I noticed the crowd was ‘blacked out’ which is extremely common for sporting events. Then I thought these a stupid high school students painting their entire body black for a ‘black out’ game and then painting joker imagery on their faces. Now I don’t know what to think. I do know I don’t have enough info from the image alone. It depicts a lot of white boys screaming at a black boy in racism but fans do this in every major American sport regardless of race. Seems a bit framed.

Edit: notice one person has a black ski mask. Does this seem racist? I’m aware the painted face resembles a minstrel show but do you think that was the intent?

What else could be the intent? It took extra work for him to add the white paint and get the details right.

I think you overestimate our ability to fully understand our world. Clearly, the idea of awareness of your intent of your actions and the possible misunderstandings that may occur from your actions is crucial. To say that you must understand is to be aware of every possible way your actions could be interpreted and then even be able to judge objectively the goodness of those interpretations. You then weigh the goodness/badness of the interpretation vs your intention and then rationalize the result. This is a lot of stress to put on every action in your life, and clearly fraught with naive ideas of right and wrong. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not justifying people who clearly disregard the feelings of others when considering their actions. I’m only saying that the quality of actions is extremely subjective as is the awareness of possible misunderstanding of those actions. You are asking people to have an awareness outside of themselves (which I agree they should have) but you should not be surprised if that awareness is limited (because it is for all of us).

So your swastika example. Though it’s a bit contrived it brings a great point. Not only the Jewish but often Germans might find this offensive. I’ve actually encountered a German who visited India and found swastikas publicly displayed. They were offended and asked how could anyone be so insensitive. In India a symbol similar to the swastika is known for good luck and it’s not uncommon for it to be used. So here we are, a country and people who’ve been forced to fight in two world wars with their colonizers, who’ve had their own customs and religions for the majority of history. Almost completely disconnected from and notion of the nazi regime and Jewish holocaust. Once again being asked to see the world through western eyes and give up a piece of their own culture. To appropriate their actions, to align with actions assumed to be correct on another continent. So in this case who is insensitive? The Indian with a swastika, or the westerner with empathy?

Limited awareness is clearly a factor, but someone who is sincerely unaware that an action could be taken as offensive isn't really culpable of racism. That being said, if it is revealed to them that their actions are causing discomfort someone who sincerely didn't know would be contrite and work to change what they are doing or make clear the context that caused them to do the action in the first place.

For your elaboration on the swastika example, The German is actively ignoring the context of the Indian usage of swastika. He is being unreceptive to the reasoning for hanging the symbols everywhere. That being said, It probably comes from a very real place of discomfort for the German. While it may not involve taking down the swastikas there should be some level of respect of the German's discomfort. Since it is a single German vs. All of India it is a bit hard to come up with an example but perhaps it could come if the form the wait staff at a restaurant not requiring him to use dinnerware with the swastika on it.

I don't think it should be a requirement to fully understand the world but it definitely should be a requirement to respect the values of other people, races, and cultures to the best of your ability. Misunderstanding happen but once they are revealed to be misunderstandings changes in behavior should arise.

I think this is quite an overreach.

India still uses the swastika and sauvastika all over the place. Those symbols are engrained into their culture. It’s not them “thinking the feelings and concerns of Jewish people are inherently less important”

They are not using them as symbols of hate, they’ve been doing it long before it was used as a symbol for hate, and they know what they’re about.

A boy in full black makeup with white shark teeth is so 1000% obviously not doing black face. If you are offended by something you can clearly see is not intended for offense, you need to grow up.

So people can paint themselves the entire rainbow spectrum of colors but not black? People paint themselves red for sporting events still, nobody cares about that. Are you saying all those people are complicit in racism and that they don’t care about Native American concerns and feelings?

It is not racist to do something that may be perceived as racist. Something just actually be inherently racist to be racist.

If My Indian cousin has a sauvastika on his backpack does that mean he’s being racist or bigoted because he knows it looks similar to a swastika? No, that’s ridiculous.

If you only paint your face black and simply proclaim its not racist I think you’d have more of an argument. But these kids painted their entire bodies black and have white streaks and white shark mouths painted on. They also have pictures and videos of them in several different color body paints.

I can’t imagine the mental gymnastics you’d have to perform to consider this racist.

Perhaps I was unclear because I don't think you quite got my point.

I am not trying to claim that specific actions are inherently racist in spite of intent. In fact, my whole first paragraph was in defense of the possibility of doing a controversial action without it confirming prejudice. My main claim however is that the cultural context of the action needs to be considered.

This point coincidentally ties into where I think your misunderstanding my swastika analogy. You have supplied a new and fundamentally different context for the displaying of a swastika than the current western view of the symbol. Whatever this symbol meant, or is supposed to mean has been radically altered for many people. Perhaps even the majority of people see the Swastika as a Nazi symbol and thus associate it with the atrocities committed by the Nazi Regime. I also specifically mentioned Jewish neighbors to highlight this factor in my analogy.

So, when you recontexualized it to India, it changes the nature of action. Displaying a swastika is not seen as offensive there. Even with the knowledge that the symbol has a dark meaning to some cultures it doesn't take on an element of racism because the prevailing message behind the symbol is the history and culture.

To clarify your critique It feels as if you are asking " If it is okay in India, why is it bad in America or Germany? How can the same action be acceptable vs. not acceptable merely based on location? "

The answer to your question is the cultural context. The exact reverse happens in America. Displaying the swastika is offensive, regardless of its ancient roots being unrelated to Nazism. Regardless of intent, displaying a swastika will be perceived as racist.

At this point in my argument you may be thinking "So what? Just because somebody else got offended doesn't mean that It was racist." To quote you directly:

It is not racist to do something that may be perceived as racist.

This is the real heart of the issue, and is pretty much a one sentence version of the main post. And as I mentioned in my first paragraph, fundamentally this is true. The perception of an activity doesn't define its quality. On that you and I wholeheartedly agree. But it isn't a complete picture of the situation. The next thing to think through are the people who insist on doing certain actions regardless of who it will offend. You said this earlier:

if you are offended by something you can clearly see is not intended for offense, you need to grow up.

This isn't all of the layers of this complicated issue. If person A does something that happens to be offensive to person B. I agree Person B should give person A the benefit of the doubt. Or in your terms "grow up". But, if person B lets person A they find their activity offensive and person A continues to do said activity. Person A is being a real DoucheCanoe.

This is the Context I keep bringing up. Both the Black and Jewish peoples have made it clear that they are uncomfortable with the behaviors previously mentioned. So doing it anyways shows a lack of caring towards them.

Pursuing an action that you know could be potentially considered racist lets everyone know that you care more about what you gain from that action than the people group affected.

So, lets apply this to the boys in all black going to the sporting event as sharks. Did any of them or the people around ever get the sense that people might be offended by their costume choice? If the answer is Yes, and they choose to go anyways they are announcing that they care more about a costume choice than respecting the years of pain caused by a history of racism going back hundred years. If the answer is no, then we should see contrition from them about potentially offending anyone but also they shouldn't be considered racist. The most you could accuse them of is being Tone-Deaf. But how likely is it in 2019 that not a single person privy to this plan considered the possibility that black full body paint might come across insensitive?

Apologies for the novel sized response, but I have one more thing to add that might increase the clarity of my argument. Racism doesn't really break down into YES/NO binary state. Let me define three possible states to quantify racism.

Active Racism: Knowingly bigoted towards a race of people. Proud to be racist, at the very least admits to prejudices against other races.

Unintentional Racism: Unconsciously treats another races problems as inferior. Wouldn't consider them selves racist. Thinks that other races are overreacting.

Not Racist: Everyone knows this one.

In light of the above idea, blackface that isn't mocking a black person isn't actively racist but is still unintentionally so.

I hope that clears up my point. I think this might be longer than my original response. Sorry :)

Thank you for taking the time to clarify to me your point as I almost entirely agree with what you wrote here.

I do disagree with your point of unintentional racism however.

For example you said a person putting on black make up that has nothing to do with imitating or mocking a black person, is unintentionally racist. I disagree.

I’m much the same way as the swastika example.

An indian person who has that symbol on their dash or backpack or a tattoo is not racist whatsoever. They’ve used it before it was used as an offensive statement, it means something entirely different to them, and they aren’t displaying it to be offensive.

There’s no accidental or unintentional racism or prejudice here because it has absolutely nothing to do with that.

Much like saying someone is a Jew, and calling someone a Jew. You can say the exact same words and nobody will bat an eye or be offended in scenario 1, but in scenario 2 where there’s another tonality to the statement it’s an entirely different story.

Three kids painting their body’s all black and standing next to a store entrance. Well this could be unintentional or intentional racism. Why are they there. Why are they painted. There’s too many questions and not enough circumstantial information to paint a clearer picture.

Three kinds at a basketball game where everyone is painting their bodies all black or with stripes and shapes on their faces, are all painted black. Well this is very different because there’s contextual evidence proving it’s not intended to be racist to such a degree that if you think it’s still racist just unintentionally, you’re looking for racism and offense in the world.

The argument is that if a white person paints themselves black it’s inherently racist. Either intentionally or unintentionally. If this is the case raiders fans across the nation are unknowingly engaging in racist activity every time they paint their face (if you’ve never been to a raiders game it’s a lot of black faces on white people usually with some silver or white thrown in.) for a game. It’s this surrounding context that makes it impossible to be unintentionally racist. Because the intent is clear, the reasoning is clear, and it has absolutely nothing to do with black people whatsoever.

There’s a difference between racism and being offensive. Is this unintentionally offensive? Of course it is that’s why it’s even being discussed, it offended people.

But to say this is racist unintentional or otherwise I think is completely wrong.

If you look past the context to find it racist then you’re the one with the problem.

By your logic anyone can be unintentionally racist simply by doing an action that offends someone. Which in our current climate, is damn near any activity a white male decides to do.

I think we are pretty close to seeing eye to eye on this. My point about unintentional racism could be clearer. When I said a person putting on black make up that has nothing to do with imitating or mocking a black person, is unintentionally racist. I don't mean that the act of blackface is racist. In fact, what about blackface at all is inherently racist. The racism overtone to blackface is mostly baked into the history of how it was used in early media. Without the stigma, and done for the right reasons blackface could really be anything from flattering, when used in a costume of a hero, to funny when used for satire. But none of those things fly today because of backlash you get for even attempting it.

So if I agree that black face doesn't have racism inherently in it, why am I say that doing innocent blackface is unintentionally racist?

This is because I am suggesting the racism of the person is unintentional not the action was unintentionally racist. I think to clarify my point, I should define some terms I have been using. Not that I think you need a vocab lesson, but I am using certain terms a specific way and I should spell some of that nuance out.

When I use 'offensive' in my previous posts, I am referring to something 'perceived' as racist. We could take the race variable out and just use prejudice too here. We could call the actions that are offensive but not actually indicative of racist thinking; 'technically' not racist activities.

When I talk about racism, I mean the idea or belief of racism. Like you've pointed out, not all actions have inherent beliefs attached to them. Racism isn't an action it is a belief. You could be racist and never act on it as well as be not racist and accidentally do or say something racist.

To compile all of my points here, I am trying to say that when you accidentally say or do something offensive but you truely don't mean it, your not being racist. You don't hold any beliefs that you are better or some race is worse. This is like my example about if the kids were actually unaware that they were wearing offensive costumes. But if you stick to an activity that is 'technically' not racist, then you are racist. The activity is still 'technically' not racist, but you have become racist.

The key factor here that maybe I haven't been stressing enough, is the reluctance or refusal of the unintentional racist to change their offensive behavior. That reluctance is a sign that your think their opinion on the matter is less important.

Think of it this way, Imagine a scenario where your Indian cousin meets a Jewish man whilst wearing a backpack with a Sauwastika. When the Jewish man expresses that the sight of their Sauwastika makes him uncomfortable, perhaps your cousin explains the history behind it and that they aren't wearing it to be pro-nazi culture but pro-indian culture. The Jewish man is understanding, but he still says that it makes him uncomfortable because of his history with it and would appreciate it if your cousin put the backpack away. Your cousin now has choice, to reassert that they technically aren't being racist and you should just suck it up. Or to respect the history that the Jewish man has with the symbol and put it away.

My whole point is that the first option your cousin could take at that crossroads has some prejudice built into it. It isn't the action that is racist but the attitude that your cousins history is more important than the jewish mans.

The person you're replying to seems to be just basing his argument on some exaggerated situations. Swastikas specifically do have a negative connotation in many parts of the world -- it's not inconsistent with what he's saying to acknowledge that in someplaces they don't, as long as his/her hypothetical of the neighbor takes place in a place where it is not, which is pretty clearly implied.

I argue that reason a shark costume is not blackface is because the black color isn't the main point of the costume. It's a very different situation -- the teeth, fins, etc are more important to the thing than the actual color. I think the discussion is talking about situations in which there is no other component of the costume that is as meaningful, so I think that's kind of the wrong direction to go with the argument.

Like u/MyNameMightBeJoren is saying, you can paint yourself black if you want, but you're responsible for the way other people see it. That's not specific to colors, that's specific to everything in life that's not explicitly illegal and is what it means to have self responsibility and think things through. You're not entitled to do whatever you want without consequence. If someone sees red or purple or blue as offensive, you'd be responsible for that as well -- it's the specificity of people saying "This is offensive" and some people saying "No its not". If they find it offensive, it's offensive, by definition. Maybe they're taking it too seriously or you were well-intentioned or something, but if it offends them, its offensive. I'd be opposed to a rule banning the color black, but its just as absurd to say we should stop people from getting upset about it if that's how they feel.

Yet, if people are finding things offensive and others feel they are overreacting and being irrational about it all, it really isn't their responsibility to care or coddle. They absolutely do have the right and are entitled to do as they please, so long as they can live with the fact that some people think they're offensive.

It's not on me, or anybody else being rational, to worry that every little action they perform, or word they utter, might offend somebody out there, because in all likelihood, somebody will, and that's their own personal problem to work out, not ours.

I think the OP understood that, yes, people should have the cultural intelligence not to wear black paint, even if they don’t mean to be racist. It’s important to understand the history, and I personally wouldn’t do it for that reason. It’ll always be PERCEIVED as racist; OP’s point is that it isn’t ACTUALLY racist.

It should also be noted that real blackface involves much more than just the paint. It involved the accentuation of stereotypical AA facial features (mostly by using lighter paint around the mouth to make the lips seem larger) and the performance of derogatory stereotypes. There is a significant difference in the content of what the students are doing vs what minstrel shows did. I don’t think a 1:1 comparison is warranted.

I'm gunna have to go with no here dog.

Blackface is a lot more than just a literal black face, it's a presentation of black individuals. It's half act. It's RDJ's character in Tropic Thunder.

While it may be distasteful because it suggests Blackface to some random passerby, (who is in the wrong, clearly) if the person isn't talking in a mimicking jive, or drawn on stuff like big lips (it's really hard to write this and not sound like an ass - I'm describing tropes of Blackface though, not tropes of black people) or other things that are clearly making fun of black people then it isn't Blackface anymore than painting lines on yourself in a football game would be "red face"

My point is about the 'distastefulness' of non mocking blackface. Yes, the offensiveness of blackface is in the history of its use to mock and dehumanize black people, and merely painting yourself black isn't really the same thing.

However, It can look like the same thing to someone on the outside looking in. And, if you are aware that your actions might some across as racist and you do it anyway you are claiming that your own personal satisfaction is more important than their discomfort.

But we are a removed third party from this incident, and any other incident we could pull as a discussion on whether or not it was appropriate.

We are not the audience that the actor chose was appropriate or not for the event. If in this school this is a known tradition(?) - which is certainly implied - then the boys maybe did consider the social scenario and chose appropriately. I understand that the argument is actually concerned with "non racist blackface" existing or not, but you focused on how one could tell whether it was or was not distasteful. If tasteful blackface exists, we cannot determine it external to the scenario.

Thank you for framing this discussion in a broader context - it now seems like a very intuitive thought process after reading your comment.

There is a glaring problem with your argument. It is terribly patronizing to black people. It assumes that many, most, or all of them are so fragile or simple minded that they can’t understand that a person is painted black because it’s their school color, or because they are playing hide and seek. You are denying that they have the intellect to make this distinction between racism and innocent action by a well meaning person. You are implying that the only power they have to deal with a possibly racist scenario is to loudly proclaim that they are too weak to deal with it. Their greatest strength is their weakness? This is a strange and dehumanizing argument.

My point is no where near 'Black people aren't smart enough to understand when an offensive action isn't actually racist'. If anything my point is closer to 'Black people are too smart to think that you didn't know this would come across like blackface and yet you did it anyways.'

My point isn't really even about the potentially offensive activity of blackface but the attitude behind persisting with it despite the cultural context of it being considered taboo. Disregarding others' discomfort with a potentially racist action in order to pursue your own personal satisfaction is the problem.

You can most assuredly create a contrived set of circumstances where the action of painting yourself black has no tie to racism.

And you can also most assuredly create a contrived set of circumstances where the action of painting yourself black can be nothing else other than racism. Let me demonstrate the other side of the coin here (poorly, I'm sure)....

In this case, the action of painting their face black betrays no racist values in their thinking. The only belief being expressed by this action is that if i become darker I will become harder to see and have an advantage at this game.

So we've established "benign intent."

Using the same example above, when the person above is making a decision to paint them selves they must also consider why not to do something as well. While the intention is purely innocent, any person whose head isn't under a rock is going to know about how touchy the subject of blackface really is.

Let's consider the "culture critic" here. The culture critic has determined intent (the color black = harder to see) and action (paint face black = harder to see at night = kick ass at hide and seek). When the culture critic is making a decision to call out a hide and seek face painter, they must also consider why not to do something as well. In this case, the reason not to call out the face painter is precisely because of intent + action. Some actions transcend intent....does this?

Even when you are painting your face black for benign reasons you are actively disregarding the feelings of the people who find it offensive.

Must every action carry the weight of cultural history? Must it carry that weight if the intent was benign? What about the feelings of the face painter, who is being told they're hurting people despite their benign intent and their pursuit of concealment during a game of hide and seek?

They know that you know that they don't like it when white people paint them selves black and they see that you have done it anyways.

This is an incredibly bizarre (and contemporary) line of reasoning to me. Again, we know from your example that a person is painting their face black specifically to conceal themselves during a game of hide and seek. How does one go about criticizing this action from a racially historical context and do so validly?

Moreover, you're placing immense agency with the source of the complaint/feelings, and not adequately dealing with the intent + action. If I'm black and I know that white people don't like being called "klansman" but I call every white person that anyway, what does that lead white people to believe about me?

Your swastika analogy is a pretty well constructed analogy as far as engendering the swastika decorator with benign intent. But you simply value the perception of his Jewish neighbors more despite acknowledging that the swastika decorator is not a nazi, likes the look of the swastika, and prefers the origins of the swastika (peace, as opposed to nazi affiliation). Ok, that's fine. But the swastika decorator shouldn't reasonably be shouldering the load of millions of Jews who suffered during WW2 in his decision to hang or nix his swastika decor because his intent (and I'd argue, action) was benign. His behavior very much could be insensitive, but....

He is devaluing them by claiming this thing that is very important to them to be less important than his decoration choices. That, IS racism, intentional or not.

I wholeheartedly, thoroughly disagree, precisely because racism is a pretty serious thing and being racist is pretty god damn intentional. Why can't this behavior just be what you've alluded to? Unintentional. I have issues with that, but at least it isn't attributing racism where the intent and action don't support such a conclusion.

This disrespect of an entire race's feeling on the grounds that its fun to do IS racism.

I mean....you're doing a lot of assuming here too, no? In asserting hegemonic views for an "entire race," I don't know, that seems a little much. I'd call it clumsy though, whereas you might describe it as "racism, intentional or not."

Interesting points, well put. Q: How does robert Downey jr fit in here, in your opinion?

I assume you are referring to his role in tropic thunder where he was in blackface. If so, then absolutely fantastic question! This is because it serves to highlight the complexity of the of how intent affects how prejudice is received.

I think the tropic thunder does an great job of breaking down what blackface is in the culture by showing the vast layering of culture context. Let me break down the pieces.

In the movie RDJ plays a white method actor who is playing the role of a black man and under goes surgery to be semi-permantly turned black. Inside the movie they talk about this being controversial and explore, with great humor, how this affects the other black characters in the movie.

Taking one step out, is it unintentionally racist for RDJ to take a black face role? No, because the movie addresses the controversial natural of blackface. It isn't him playing a black characters it is him playing a white character who doesn't understand how touchy playing a black character is.

It also serves to highlight the other side of this issue. In the movie RDJ's character is very clearly doing this with no racist intent he is just trying to nail the role.

So the context for his role makes it clear he isn't being racist and the movie addresses the controversy with respect to both sides. This respect shows he isn't thinking less of other races opinion. Making tropic thunder not only not racist but a fantastic analysis of blackface.

any person whose head isn't under a rock is going to know about how touchy the subject of blackface really is

Seems like you are not considering the possibility that the group of students in the recent controversy could very well be a group of people with their "heads under rocks"

You're talking about a school where all the kids parents only watch Fox news, and all their teachers only watch fox news, and all the kids friend's parents, and family members, and so on, only watch Fox news. Now, I can see how would be hard to not blame a grown adult, but is it honestly so hard to believe that, knowing what we know about this group of kids, that their heads were legitimately "under rocks" in regards to this issue? When I was a kid, I didn't really know much about right and wrong beyond what my parents and teachers told me.

No it’s not racism, it’s called being an asshole, but not racist. Racism is about race, nothing in your comment is about race. Specifically about your race’s superiority over others, which you don’t talk about. What are your thoughts on the new example where pictures of white chimney sweepers, with soot on their faces, is now considered blackface. Is that also racist?

oldDotredditisbetter

what do you think of a different culture that does black face? https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/world/asia/china-africa-blackface-lunar-new-year.html

While the intention is purely innocent, any person whose head isn't under a rock is going to know about how touchy the subject of blackface really is. Continuing with the plan in spite of the risk is where the logic of your view begins to break down. Even when you are painting your face black for benign reasons you are actively disregarding the feelings of the people who find it offensive. They know that you know that they don't like it when white people paint them selves black and they see that you have done it anyways.

This is where your argument because tautological and contrived. "It's offensive because it's offensive, and to take issue with that is offensiveness in it of itself." By no means am I making a case in favor of blackface, but this is a weak reasoning against it.

a man who hangs a Swastika on the front door of his house.

Totally different scenario and thoroughly unrealistic. What benefit, real or imaginary, would there be to do such a thing?

Would a man ever paint a circle over his door? A square? A trapezoid? This isn't something that makes sense even in purely hypothetical terms.

Would a man ever paint themselves with a blue face? A white face? A black face? Well of course. Plenty of people paint their faces for events.

While my specific word choices are a bit circular, I don't find the point of my argument to be tautological.

It's offensive because it's offensive, and to take issue with that is offensiveness in it of itself.

This is clever, but it leaves out the meat of my point a more accurate sentiment might be.

"It's offensive because it is widely considered offensive, and to take issue with that is to offend the people who consider it offensive."

Wordplay aside, my point is perhaps better summarize this way: "Disregarding others' discomfort with black face paint in order to pursue your own personal satisfaction is implicitly racist. "

As for my swastika analogy, it is intentionally contrived and mean to isolate a specific variable. So yes, It is unrealistic, but it is meant to make you think about the ramifications of IF it were to happen and then apply the same revealed principles to the main argument. So, in that example it is very clear the man is disregarding his neighbors sensibilities.

Racism is the belief in the superiority of one race over another, I fail to see how painting oneself in another race color is seen as discrimination.

I mentioned in another comment that blackface wouldn't be 'inherently' racist if it weren't for the history of it's use.

But that history IS there. And blackface is a reminder to a lot of people of a time when the world was a lot worse for their people.

I think it’s our responsibility as a society to acknowledge history. At the very least, even giving the benefit of the doubt, the community should come together and talk about the history of blackface and never do it again out of common decency and respect for hard-learned historical lessons.

I agree that blackface should not be done out of common decency. Where we inherently disagree is what constitutes "blackface." Would you count the Shadow Link cosplay as something that can't be done any longer?

Isn't this why context matters? And why some of those kids being in clear and obvious minstrelsy somewhat pull the rug out from under their claims that it wasn't blackface, but was 'black out the competition'?

There's not a lot of ambiguity here. If these kids were wearing a Link outfit, with a Hyrule-ian sword and shield, and had dyed everything dark grey/black, and painted their bodies black, we'd probably understand them to be 'shadow link'. If they're standing in front of a black guy at a basketball game screaming obscenities from the sidelines with their faces painted in clear minstrelsy, I don't think we should pretend it's anything other than blackface.

I think you and I actually may agree here in general. My OP was, at its simplest, that in some contexts, painting one's face does not constitute blackface. That necessitates an analysis of the context and way in which it was done. The guy with the white painted lips isn't a hill I'm going to die on - I think it's sufficient to say that people could reasonably disagree about whether it depicts blackface, but regardless it was an unwise decision to depict himself that way.

That being said, I think my OP really would center around the other students painted jet black. Similar to Dark Link, given the context of a "blackout" game, I think it's clear that their intent was not to imitate a black person, and so their use of black paint would not constitute blackface.

But your argument seems to include the position that the Covington kids weren't performing blackface, which I think is a clear and obvious slap in the face of the spirit of 'context matters'. If you don't understand/agree that they were indeed performing blackface, I think you don't understand/agree that context matters. I think you're ignoring the context of the situation if you're claiming they weren't trying to imitate a black person, given the context.

People could reasonably disagree about the minstrel lips depicting blackface?

How? I honestly have no idea what you are talking about.

It's obviously blackface.

How about we just stop having ‘black outs’ at schools. Why is it a thing? I don’t get it. Additionally, I read that the school also had a blue out day- nobody painted their entire bodies blue.

Why should schools stop an activity just because you can't seperate a school spirit activity from a racist one?

Just because you think it's clear and obvious that something is a certain way doesn't mean it is so.

The above poster ask every day you your criteria for thinking something is blackface or not in the first place, you completely avoided that by begging the question.

Which is why I asked the above user a few times if they had photographic evidence of minstrelsy face paint when the kids were in other color body paint.

Except for the fact that lots of colleges did it and they stopped it long before other colleges. How can you contend that their racist because they had a blackout game and banned it in 2013 after a video came out, but not call colleges that didn’t stop doing that until 2016 racist as well?

I am unaware of colleges that still do this, can you provide a citation for this claim?

According to the snopes article on Covington and the blackface photograph, they also only stopped because a facebook group called it out as blackface.

I’ve dressed up by painting my entire face and neck black for Halloween as Venom. I don’t think anyone would consider that black face. As the above poster said, context is key.

I don't think that's context, that's just text. If you resemble Venom (a widely-known character in pop culture), most people who just glance at a photo of your costume would instantly know it was a reference to a comic book character, they wouldn't need to know that you were costuming as the nonhuman Symbiote that sometimes was an evil version of Spider-Man for a party.

But isn’t that what the poster is asking or have i misunderstood? He’s asking if blackening your skin is always racist, (even mentioned cosplay IIRC?) and that’s an example of where I wouldn’t consider it to be.

Isnt this exactly why meghan kelly was fired?

I had to google who that was, but it looks like she made comments about why people should be allowed to dress up as Diana Ross for Halloween, blackface and all. She also apparently has a history of racially insensitive comments such as the white Jesus thing so I wouldn’t think it’s exactly the same thing at all no.

If you do it poorly, it might evoke a minstrel-esque look which would offend people and come off insensitive, at worst racist.

However, googling "shadow link cosplay" brings up many examples of said cosplay done well. When you have the ears, the red/purple eyes, the hat and other various items, it decidedly does not look like you are dressing up as a black person.

Also, shadow link is sort of a corner case as it is a character who has black skin who isn't actually ethnically black. It's generally not OK for white people to paint their skin to cosplay ethnically black characters.

I see the grey area there. I personally wouldn’t think dark link is blackface because I’m a part of video game culture, but at the same time, impact matters as much as intention. If people felt discriminated against because they didn’t understand what dark link is and thought it was an attack, then I think a conversation should be had and quite possibly we could decide out of respect to not do dark link cosplays anymore. A reverence for the historical significance and impact is really important in my view.

We can't stop people from being ignorant and misinterpreting things. If someone misinterprets something, we need to teach them how and why they misinterpreted it, not command the other person to not be misinterpreted, that's an impossible ask.

Agreed. i see the grey area as well, we will likely however differ on how we handle that. I tend to use you way too much in my explanations. this preface is here to state that i'm not talking about YOU as in the reader. Metaphorical You.

i'm as well a part of video game culture, being a gamer since my wee days, and in full understanding of how folks view blackface, i generally disdain modern uses of it myself.

The problem here is nuance and context.

I'll piggyback the dark link example. Dark link is a character with an appearance that would necessitate jet-black paint, however he is not what one would consider a black person.

this clearly wouldn't be a "racist use" of "black face". no doubt to be had, period. clearly different intentions.

moving on, if people felt discriminated against because of a cosplay, that's fine, they're allowed to feel that way, i wouldn't want to remove their ability to feel. Starting a conversation would be a good idea, very much. discussion in general is usually a good idea.

it's a character with a specific appearance, they're not making fun of/ destroying your heritage.

The problem comes with the "we could possibly decide to not do dark link cosplays anymore."

why? what reason would we have other than people outside of the community not understanding what he is, and bending our knee to their squishy feefees?

Folks are going to be ignorant of things, and not understand things. that's not the problem of the cosplayer. that's the problem of the observer.

those kids? though? blackface (as in non black folks painting on another melanin content) in general is racist as heck.

Intention matters more than impact but it's much harder to measure where impact is much easier to measure.

If we had perfect knowledge then intention would be the only thing that mattered because being offended when no offense was intentional would just be a waste of energy.

I think this is valid but I think it's equally valid (if not more so) to expect people possibly offended by dark link to find out what he was before shutting it down

I think respect should cut both ways and cosplays for dark link shouldn't cease because people don't know what he is

I don't know about op's examples, but "things that are black" =/= black people

Do you believe it is an acceptable practice in countries that do not share American history? For example, I know that South Korean comedians have been criticized for using blackface in comedy shows, but South Korea has no history of enslaving black people. Hell, black people existing in Korea is a new concept in general.

Interesting. I do think intent matters and the interplay between intent and impact matters. Here, I’m not sure what the intent is. There might be a different cultural meaning for it. If the intent is to imitate black people and black culture, then that’s not cool. Ultimately there’s no conflict because they aren’t interacting with people who are impacted by it. At the same time, it is not cool to be culturally insensitive. It would be like an American comic making fun of the Korean culture. Even if there are no Koreans in the audience and everyone thinks it’s funny, it’s still a dick move. Respect for cultural differences is important. Does that make sense?

Where is gets really hairy is when another culture is really into something that’s objectively wrong. In some religions and some parts of the world, it’s considered acceptable to do honor killings, like a father kills his daughter if she brings dishonor on the family by being the victim of rape (?!?!?!). This is objectively wrong, but an outsider can’t just come in and save the day for everyone in that culture. Cultural change is slow and it usually needs to come from inside the culture. So as an outsider, I am motivated to have conversations with and empower people in that culture who want to change that norm.

I think your position makes a lot of sense, and your responses seem mostly reasonable. That said, I think you’re glossing over the key point.

First: let’s assume that black facepaint is definitely a different thing than traditional blackface. Even if that’s the case, all we’ve established is that no one’s doing an exact copy of the original thing that was called blackface.

But the term certainly could still be used: the whole argument is, should we be using the word blackface to describe black facepaint that’s this style.

And your response is “only if it’s intended to depict a black person”.

It seems like your argument rests on the idea that intention and aim are key. And it seems like you mean either the intention of the wearer—i.e. anything can be blackface if the person means it to be—or the intention behind its design—i.e. since traditional blackface was designed to mock black people, anyone who wears it is passing on that message, even if they don’t realize it.

Here’s the key question for you: is full blackout facepaint a form of blackface if the person wearing it means it to be?

Because if so—if a person uses full black facepaint as a form of blackface—then at some point, we hit the same problem where the “black face red lips” rules apply.

So whatever that threshold would be, I’d be interested to hear it. Because whatever it is, I think there’s probably evidence that it’s been reached.

You bring up a good point. Granted, what I meant was that the key consideration was whether or not the painted face objectively appears as though it depicts a black person. I shouldn't have said intent because, as you pointed out, intent of the wearer is largely irrelevant in coming to a determination that a given usage is acceptable. Intent can be relevant, however, in determining that a given usage is unacceptable. Though I didn't mean to argue intent, as some of my subsequent replies have fleshed out, I'll award the delta because you pointed out a flaw in my original argument.

I have seen advanced arguments that any time someone paints their face, it is blackface and racist. This the specific claim that I am opposing. I think that by taking such an absolute position is unwise.

I think I agree with this, though it might not be the kind of racism you'd think at first blush.

Would you agree that there is a continuum of racism that we all fall into? Literally hunting black people would be the worst kind of racism, a waiter giving a black family poor service would be down the scale, and something like seeing a group of black kids hanging out on the street at dusk and feeling a little on edge would be further down still.

If you wore black paint on your face, you either:

Don't care about the historical context of the practice, or

Don't know about the historical context

In either case, I think that would be a result of racism. More directly in the first case - you are intentionally doing something that you know may offend a certain group and you don't care about offending them. But in the second case as well - there is some implicit racism in there that you grew up in a situation that caused you to be unaware of racial issues in the surprisingly-recent past.

So black-painted faces are racist, just not the most insidious, intentional kind of racism.

But in the second case as well - there is some implicit racism in there that you grew up in a situation that caused you to be unaware of racial issues in the surprisingly-recent past.

That's not any sane definition of racism. Using your system, anyone could make up new rules at any time and people who never got the memo (aren't on the Woke Breaking News list) would be guilty of racism. That seems crazy.

For instance, I work with a woman who is part Blackfoot. She had no idea First Nations was a term, let alone the preferred, least offensive, and she's native american. And that was just last month! She also didn't know we're not supposed to say Inuit anymore (Eskimo is much, much worse still, fyi). Is she racist for not knowing these things and calling Native Americans 'Indian' as she did/does? Of course not. Terrible idea. Implicit racism is intellectual cancer. Mystical faux-research.

That's why we care about explicit intent and don't do 3D mental gymnastic to indict people on ignorance alone. Especially kids.

Did you read the link I left on "implicit racism"? You think that's insane?

I've got to get back to work, but I think you bring up a really good point about the continuum of racism. Tagging your comment so I can come back to potentially award a delta.

I think this is a good point that gets at the heart of the prevalence of institutional racism. Not everything has to be inherent and purposeful for it to be detrimental. Just because the intent to be racist isn't there doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

How would you feel about this modification:

If one is going to paint one's face black, one has a moral obligation to proactively ensure that the context makes it extremely clear that they are not engaging in "blackface". Otherwise, their action is ignoring the history of this action to place their own aesthetics above the legitimate concerns of people who have been attacked by racists using blackface to denigrate blacks, and people are justified in suspecting racist intent.

Interesting approach. I'm going to award you a delta for partially changing my position, albeit slightly. !delta

I think the affirmative shifting of that burden is a good distinction and one that, absent several complications (which I'll cover shortly), is a good starting point.

That being said, I see several issues in practicality of this approach, mainly centering on what constitutes "proactively ensuring." In practice, does that mean the individual merely has to deliberate over the question? Or is it something more than that (e.g., conferring with expected participants, conferring with black people beforehand)? Second, there's the issue of time. For instance, I believe that the picture that stirred up all this controversy was from an event in 2015. Say he "proactively ensured" (whatever that may mean) that the face painting was not inappropriate for the context back then. Then in 2025, the picture emerges, societal expectations have changed, and it would no longer be considered contextually appropriate. Then the individual gets painted as a racist, despite taking the necessary steps at the time for it to be considered acceptable. This point may be fairly moot though because inherently, societal expectations change, so virtually all actions we engage in are subject to scrutiny using a different lens at some unknown future point in time.

Anyway, thanks for the suggested modified approach.

Thanks, I mostly meant avoiding minstrel-like face paint and/or having a costume that makes it clear you're playing a character unrelated to blackface tropes or stereotypes of black people.

E.g. it's perfectly ok, and people would have to be idiots to object to, playing the character Nightcrawler from Marvel Comics, especially if you used a blue-ish black like his skin.

Putting on blackface and dressing up as a monkey? Just no. Blacks have been portrayed as monkeys as a form of oppression for decades. If you want to be a monkey, wear something that's clearly a monkey mask and avoid black-people tropes (e.g. fried chicken or watermelon) while doing so.

We can't really help people in the future who don't consider the context of the time and whether the character you're playing would have been a caricature of black people at the time you wore it. But neither can we excuse people that wear costumes that play on historical racist portrayals that would be understood by non-willfully-ignorant people in their time.
