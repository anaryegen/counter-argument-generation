Benefits of being transparent in the workplaceThere are many benefits of being transparent in the workplace, whether you are in a leadership role or are a general employee. Consider why it is important to be transparent in the workplace and the following benefits:

Genuine relationshipsGenuine relationships build off of transparency and trust. When you are transparent, authentic connections form with coworkers because you mutually help each other and share information. Genuine relationships grow from knowing one another openly from the start. Open relationships are reliable, which makes them especially valuable in the workplace.

Clear communicationWhen you communicate clearly with employees, you avoid any misinterpretation. As a result, your conversation is transparent and easily understood. When you engage in clear communication, you encourage questions and give the other person a chance to reexplain themselves if necessary.

Improved productivityImproved productivity is another benefit of being transparent in the workplace. When employees are consistently transparent, they ask more questions, request help and explain their reasoning. When there is transparency among employees, projects tend to finish faster because any confusion clears up immediately.

Established trustWhen you are transparent over time, employees trust you because they know you are always honest and open with them. Established trust is the core of a successful workplace because it welcomes respectful dialogue between employees and encourages positive interactions.

Proper team buildingCreating strong workplace teams starts with assessing what type of teams the company needs. It also requires you to figure out which employees should be in what groups. When you are transparent, you let management know what team would suit you best and what kind of support you need.For example, you might say you need help with managing project finances. This transparency lets your manager know that someone with financial expertise on your team will benefit you and, ultimately, the project's success.

Prepared employeesIf you are a leader in your company, transparency can help employees feel prepared. For example, if you know your company will gain a highly important client, letting your employees know gives them time to prepare accordingly.Similarly, if you are not in a management position, your transparency can still help team members prepare for situations. For example, suppose you are transparent in saying you are unfamiliar with a program. Because you let your coworkers know they can prepare ahead of time and find you the necessary support.Related: What is Respect in the Workplace?

How to be transparent in the workplaceBeing transparent in the workplace is a great way to create genuine and honest connections with employees. A transparent leader provides a strong foundation and encourages employees to trust the company. Consider the following steps to be more transparent in the workplace:

1. Speak honestlySpeaking honestly to other employees means you explain how you feel and what you are thinking in a genuine manner. You state your true emotions and explain yourself so that others can understand. Honesty is very valuable in the workplace because when you are honest, especially about needing help, others can provide solutions for you. Otherwise, employees won't know what is going on or how to assist you.

2. Disclose informationDisclosing information is similar to speaking honestly in regards to saying what you really mean. Disclosing information means not holding back specific details when talking to someone. It also means letting employees know what you mean to the fullest extent. Some ways to disclose information more easily is by setting up a time to meet with an employee and finding a private space to talk.

3. Ask questionsAsking questions demonstrates a sense of humility and transparency because you recognize your need to improve and learn. Asking questions is also a great way of encouraging others to explain what they don't know. This environment creates a learning experience where people share their knowledge with others. Transparency in asking questions reveals any additional training that employees need and the difference in employee knowledge.

4. Provide feedbackWhether you provide feedback through an evaluation or informally by conversation, providing feedback is a practical approach to being transparent. Providing feedback means giving someone positive and negative remarks on their performance or project. When you are transparent, or when you build a reputation of being transparent, people are more accustomed to your feedback and take it more easily. Feedback informs employees on what they need to work on and acknowledges their efforts when they do well. When you are transparent, you give constructive feedback often.Related: What Is Authentic Leadership? (Definition and Characteristics)

5. Stay professionalStaying professional is a part of being transparent. Although transparency does mean sharing truthful information, it does not require that you disclose absolutely everything about yourself or go into great detail about your personal life. Also, make sure to respect employee privacy and not push them to be transparent when they are not ready. Instead, act as an example of transparency that they can look to for motivation and inspiration to be more open.

6. Be realisticBeing realistic is a great way to stay transparent in the workplace. When analyzing your business realistically, you become aware of positive and negative characteristics. Transparency means recognizing how your business is doing well and how it can improve. When you speak to other employees, focus on setting practical goals that are obtainable for the company. When you are realistic, you recognize what you and your company have to offer and you share your thoughts directly with employees.

7. Share business performanceIf you are in a management position, consider sharing your business's performance with other employees. When you share business performance, you show statistics and analytics on how the company is doing, regardless of how good or bad the numbers.This approach might be challenging because the performance can be negative, but it is valuable information to share. Your transparency and willingness to provide this data make employees feel included and informed about company operations.
