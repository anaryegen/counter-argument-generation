Why People Hate Mutants But No Other Superheroes?

#1 Edited By DeathpooltheT1000

I mean, to be honest i dont care if The Thing or Hulk are mutants or dont.

They are very dangerous and could destroy a part of the city by themselves.

I mean, i know Mutants = New Human Race.

But so do the Fantastic Four.

I've always wondered this myself. I mean in the movies it makes sense because there's no other superhero team out there but the X-Men, but in the comics I just always bang my head against the wall whenever the people want to lynch the X Men but will turn right around and d***ride the F4 or the avengers.

They do, X-Men comics are more based around the idea.

@deathpoolthet1000: There have been lots of reasons. I asked this before, one person said it was because the humans felt like they were basically being replaced. Also racism doesn't normally make sense, so after thinking about it it doesn't really seem far fetched.

IDK, maybe humans in the Marvel universe are naturally stupid.

Actually in the comic Marvels, I remember this one woman saying that while Thing was hideous, at least he wasn't one of those dreadful mutants.

@deathpoolthet1000: Hulk has been considered dangerous numerous times. Thats why Planet Hulk happened

People hate Spiderman. He's powerful but he couldn't destroy a city, AND he's not a mutant. Marvel peasants just like to hate heroes.

Spidey, the hulk, ghost rider and even Cap have had periods where they were hated by the public at large. Most superheroes have had this in their history at one point or another.

Because the X-Men do not fit in the Marvel Universe.

Because that's how the writers want them to act..?

Tbh I don't know either. Probably it was done to add more emphasis on the fact that their humans but "different" at the same time.

They kind of brought this up in Civil War when Captain America asked for the X-Men's help.

I think it's really stupid too, especially how reckless the Fantastic Four are. The Thing and Johnny get in a fight and smash up the apartment and act like the owner is a jerk for getting upset. They actually deserve to be hated for how irresponsible they are.

Marvel citizens are d bags.

@deathpoolthet1000: Originally The X Men were independent. But when writers connected the X Men to the rest of the marvel universe, this plot hole was never filled.

It wasnt because of their powers or they werent normal humans.

But how does people know who is a mutant and who isnt a mutant, also i dont believe Metahumans still count as homo sapiens sapiens.

Wait DC humans are smarter?

Yeah, it looks people dont have problems with the chaos they unleash.

That actually would explain this thing.

@deathpoolthet1000: Beats me

If there's one thing I know about the general public in comics, it's that they're stupid jack@$$es with no logic at all

@deathpoolthet1000: I'm pretty sure the powers factor into it whether people admit it or not. People fear Hulk because he's a giant green rage monster. Remember when Ronald Reagan went around trying to smash stuff? No one gave a crap. I'm pretty sure I remember people being afraid of Ghost Rider because he's a skull faced demon/angel.

Still mutants without power gets shit and people fear them for being mutants.

There is something about being mutant, that i just simply dont get.

Because mutants are considered to be the next step in human evolution, meaning that they somehow are the reason to normal human extinction, and superheroes are just random guys who got their powers from an accident. PeopleÂ´s fear has nothing to do with the destructive capacity of someone, it has to do with the mutants being the reason of normal human extinction.

@deathpoolthet1000: because people are afraid of being replaced by the next generation. It's makes about as much sense as hating people for being a different color or some such. It's bigotry,more often then not it doesn't truly make sense.

PLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!

"But how does people know who is a mutant and who isnt a mutant, also i dont believe Metahumans still count as homo sapiens sapiens."

see that is a plot issue, in one of the first issues of inhumans, some one freaked out because of the "inhuman" and in my mind i was just like so you looked at him and could tell he was an inhuman and not a mutant.

Anyways meta human in marvel is someone who got their power unnaturally right? so technically it wasn't through evolution

Last but not least there have been plenty of issues where large crowds were outside of the avengers mansions yelling and picketing. some people hate mutants, some people don't , some people hate ALL super humans.

dude, you're over thinking. I know people who hate jamaicans but not africans, chinese but not japanese. Slave owners often had sex with the female slaves, even though blacks were considered vermin. Racism doesn't make sense but each person has their own reason for it. So for the sake of the comic just pretend each person has their own reason for hating mutants. Maybe one person had an abusive mutant dad, maybe anothers friend was killed by a mutant.

I respect your question i really see why youd be confused, at one point I was too, but you might as well be asking why racism exists in general.

Same reason why so many people hate Superman, but pay no mind to characters like Thor, I imagine. Just a popular opinion.

Cause they're idiot Civvies.

1. Racism and fearing the extinction/replacement of the normal human race.

2. Destructive capacity.

4. The most well know mutants (other than the X-men, who try to stay out of the public eye when they can) are people like Magneto and other mutant who have openly threatened and kill normal humans because of mutant superiority. It's the same reason many people were scared of any who was Arab or Muslim after 9/11, because people started associating all Arabs and Muslims with the group that attacked the US.

5. Misinformation. This goes along with 4 a little bit. If you ever read Marvel Civil War, even though it was the villain Nitro who killed all those people, people still blamed the New Warriors, who tried to stop him, for the deaths. During catastrophes, the details of what happened becomes blurry and people will only hear some information or just what they want to hear.

6. People in comics turn on superheros all the time at the drop of a hat (a kid decided he hates Superman because his brother sat his car on a train track so that Superman could save him and Superman arrived too late to save him from being hit).

Its not about powers.

Its about how human are afraid that since mutants are the "next step in human evolution" that humans will become dinosaurs.

Not to be too meta but, Mutants are essentially and most of the time exclusively written to be an allegory for discrimination. Other heroes just aren't. I guess you could that it's due to make the discrimination more isolated in a way. You could chop it up to plot holes, but it is what it is.

#33 Edited By Quicksilver77

I have no idea. If Nightcrawler was in the Avengers everyone would love him.

Because the X-Men do not fit in the Marvel Universe.

It got to the point where human supremacists are getting away with blowing up bus full of kids, school shootings, murdering babies and etc... And the public doesn't give an sh*t because they are mutants? Come the f*ck on...

#36 Edited By cresShadow

you can never rationalize racism. even if you have a reason like "a mutant killed my family" or "A mutant ruined my life" that doesnt justify hating the ENTIRE RACE. and that's a thing that goes down in our reality. but it's not 100% black and white if you ask me. any young hero with powers whether it's true or not are automatically deemed mutants. hell, there was an issue of X-men where a bunch of dumb rednecks were trying to figure out the difference like one who thought that thor, thing, and dr doom were mutants. but an avenger doesnt have this issue because they are always loved and supported by the media and government as we see with quicksilver, scarlet witch, justice, and firestar. all mutants but rarely get hated on because of their status. and dont let the movies fool you, spider-man still gets his hate mods from time to time. the X-men had to suffer for years because corrupt congress men or anyone in power insist that mutants= human extinction and as a result, along with a few set ups and actual evil mutants, the public still fears mutants in general. it's propaganda fueling hate because after years of reading both avengers and X-men, the bigger and more constant threats to the world are either non mutant humans or beings that arent human at all like ultron, the skrulls, or thanos but do to the powers that be fearing the idea of losing their power try to make anyone who they cant control look bad. dont believe me? look at X-factor old and new. both backed and supported by powerful people of authority and the people relatively trust them. In all new X-factor #12, they almost looked like celebrities. but all the other X-factions are feared and hated more so than not. but there's still hope. the X-men's time in San Fransisco proves that they can be viewed as good people. the public just need to learn.

people care, they just rarely show those ones. It's much more interesting reading them getting hated on i guess.

but yes you are right it is pretty crazy at times. It gets pushed to the back burner, especially with the avengers, who don't really avenge all the mutants who are hated on lol, but the moment cyclops goes nuts they throw him in a mutant hating prison on purpose to die

Because comic books.

This is only one of the factors in play, but there is a bacteria called Sublime that, as I understand it, infects and manipulates the minds of every living thing... except for mutants. Those with the x-gene are immune to infection, and it has become clear that much of the hatred and stigma toward mutants has been Sublime's doing, in an attempt to wipe them out and prevent human evolution from stretching beyond its grasp. If you'd like more information, I'd search for John Sublime (the alias of bacterium's humanoid avatar), since that seems to be its page title on most info sites.

The thing is that in modern comics the "plight" of anyone superhuman or mutant doesn't make sense, back in the day sure I mean X-Men was conceived with that notion, but in the Marvel or DC universe(s) mutants at least have/had enough members of their species to populate a a country, genosha, and that wasn't even all of them, factor in all the other superhumans, and to be honest a healthy dose of the worlds population is either mutated or superhuman in some form, I would say at least a fifth to a quarter of the Marvel universe earth has superpowers, DC less so because they focus mostly on human gimmicked supers, and most of the threats to them are either transdimensional or alien, most of their earthbound heroes and villians are like i said people with a gimmick or tool. so i would say about a seventh to a sixth for DC. Mutants by now should be more widely accepted especially as I personally find the notion that my heroes were born and raised here instead of from another world/dimension, as it would prove even the most humble family may one day produce someone as amazing as all the other heroes out there. it would prove humanity is still evolving and our potential is astounding.

Magneto, Apokolips, and even Wolverine don't help the Mutant's case much. In fact there was a time Wolverine in the Avengers would not happen. It's only after that quack Bendis came along that he made Wolverine an Avenger. Wolverine slashes, mutilates, murders and dismembers bad guys and you think Captain America or even Iron Man would allow him on the team? It was until Bendis' murderous spree of characterization in the Marvel universe that it happened.

Here is the like to the article directly from marvel Sublime is cause for mutant hate http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Sublime_(Earth-616)

Sublime was the self-appointed name of a sentient bacterial life-form that arose during the beginnings of life on Earth. With the rise of multi-cellular lifeforms, Sublime found endless numbers of hosts it could infect. However, mutantkind, immune to Sublime's infection, eventually arose and multiplied, becoming the first threat to Sublime's domination.

It was hinted that the very hatred and fear of mutants was caused by Sublime itself. But the bacteria took more direct actions in order to ensure that mutant population would be held in check, if not exterminated, in order to keep it from becoming the dominant species of the planet.

Because shhhhhhh. Don't think about it.

Couse they continue to whining "no, the human will exterminate us" and fight mutants vs mutants creating destruction on humanity, instead of been superhero and fight against evil for the whole human race [as Charles Xavier have dreamed]. Mutants are no longer superheroes by many years...

Magneto, Apocalypse, and even Wolverine don't help the Mutant's case much. In fact there was a time Wolverine in the Avengers would not happen. It's only after that quack Bendis came along that he made Wolverine an Avenger. Wolverine slashes, mutilates, murders and dismembers bad guys and you think Captain America or even Iron Man would allow him on the team? It was until Bendis' murderous spree of characterization in the Marvel universe that it happened.

because its racism like in real life.
