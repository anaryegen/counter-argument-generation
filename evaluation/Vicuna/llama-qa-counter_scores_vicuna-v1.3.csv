This would also disregard the fact that women are disproportionately affected by pregnancy and childbirth, and that they should have the ultimate decision-making power over their own bodies. Furthermore, it would be unfair to allow men to opt-out of financial obligations while still expecting women to bear the physical and emotional burdens of pregnancy and parenthood."

The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the issues at hand, presents well-reasoned arguments supported by evidence (e.g., different individuals may have different needs and requirements for space), and contributes to a constructive dialogue. However, there may still be minor areas for improvement or further elaboration, such as providing examples of how the belief can be implemented in practice to ensure equality."," While the belief that males do not have a superior right to occupy more space than others may be a step towards promoting equality, it does not necessarily guarantee equality in public spaces, as different individuals may have different needs and requirements for space. Moreover, promoting this idea could inadvertently create a new form of inequality if not implemented carefully. Therefore, it is not the belief itself, but rather the implementation of equality in practice that is crucial for promoting equality in public spaces."
