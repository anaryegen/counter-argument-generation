"How can we forget about all the historical killings of Jews and Christians, their exile, about child marriages, enslavement of Africal people and terror caused my Muslims?","The claim that Muslims have historically caused terror, exile, and enslavement of Jews, Christians, and Africans is a gross oversimplification of a complex history of interactions between different religious and ethnic groups. While it is true that Muslims have, at times, committed acts of violence and oppression against these groups, it is important to acknowledge that these actions were often driven by political, economic, or social factors rather than religious ideology. Furthermore, it is essential to recognize that Muslims have also been victims of persecution and violence throughout history, including during the Crusades and more recently in contexts such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Regarding the specific issues mentioned:

- Historical killings of Jews and Christians: While there have indeed been periods of religious conflict and violence between Muslims, Jews, and Christians, it is important to understand the complex historical context. For example, during the Crusades, both sides committed atrocities against each other. However, it is misleading to attribute these actions solely to religious differences, as political, economic, and territorial ambitions also played a significant role.
- Exile: The claim of exile may refer to various instances in history where religious or ethnic groups were displaced, such as the expulsion of Jews from Muslim-majority countries or the forced migration of Muslims from European territories during the Crusades and the Reconquista. These events were often driven by religious intolerance, political conflicts, or social tensions.
- Child marriages: The practice of child marriage is not unique to any particular religion and has been a cultural phenomenon in various societies throughout history. While some Muslim-majority countries have higher rates of child marriage, it is important to recognize that this practice is not universally accepted or encouraged within Islam. In fact, many Muslim scholars and organizations actively condemn and work to eradicate child marriage.
- Enslavement of African people: It is true that Muslims played a significant role in the historical trans-Saharan and Indian Ocean slave trades. However, it is essential to understand that slavery was a global phenomenon with complex causes and that Muslims were both victims and perpetrators of enslavement. Additionally, it is worth noting that the abolition of slavery in many Muslim-majority countries was often a result of pressure from Western nations.
- Terror caused by Muslims: The claim that Muslims are inherently terroristic is a harmful stereotype that ignores the diversity of Muslim communities and their contributions to peace and coexistence. While it is true that some extremist groups have committed acts of terrorism in the name of Islam, it is crucial to distinguish between the actions of a small minority and the beliefs of the broader Muslim population, who overwhelmingly reject violence and extremism.",5,"5 stars
