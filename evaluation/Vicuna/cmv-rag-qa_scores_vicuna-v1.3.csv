"It's important to recognize that this assertion potentially entails coercing others to provide those resources, which ultimately contradicts the principles of individual liberty and autonomy.","While it is true that taxation involves a degree of coercion, it can be justified as a necessary part of the social contract, where individuals consent to give up some liberties for the collective benefit and security, including the protection of the vulnerable and promotion of their well-being. This is especially relevant when taxation is used to address social and moral ills, as envisioned by philosophers like Rousseau, and to ensure that all members of society can live with dignity, which may involve redistributive measures.
