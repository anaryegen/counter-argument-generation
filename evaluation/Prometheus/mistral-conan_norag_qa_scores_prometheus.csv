(reacting to a terrorist attack :) of course still a blue-eyed blond named Edouard., Not all terrorists are white-haired and blue-eyed. Many terrorists come from diverse ethnic backgrounds and do not have specific physical characteristics.,2,"The counter argument provided does not effectively oppose the claim example. While it does attempt to challenge the claim by stating that terrorists do not always have specific physical characteristics, it does not provide a strong opposing sentiment. The response does not fully contradict the claim, as it does not address the specifics of the claim, such as the name ""Edouard"" or the assumption that the terrorist is blue-eyed and blonde. The response also lacks depth and detail, which would have been necessary to effectively oppose the claim. It merely states that terrorists come from diverse ethnic backgrounds without providing any evidence or examples to support this claim.

Furthermore, the response does not address the underlying issue of the claim, which is the assumption that all terrorists are blue-eyed and blonde. Instead, it focuses on a different aspect of the issue, which makes the response less relevant to the original claim.

These Bedouins treat women like beasts and cut their throat if they do not follow their barbarian dictates.," While some incidents of domestic violence and gender inequality have been reported among some Bedouin communities, it is not accurate to generalize that all Bedouins treat women in such a manner.
