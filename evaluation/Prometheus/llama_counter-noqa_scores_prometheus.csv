Expanding government powers should not be the preferred solution. Checks and balances in government institutions and a focus on promoting transparency and accountability can ensure effective governance without sacrificing citizens' rights and freedoms.," In times of crisis or emergency, expanding government powers may be necessary to protect citizens and maintain order, as seen in historical examples where swift action was required to address a national threat.

So the overall score is 2.",2,"The counter argument provided in the response is not entirely devoid of fact-based evidence, but it does contain some elements of disinformation. The claim that increased access to contraception could lead to increased rates of sexually transmitted infections is not supported by any concrete evidence, and it could be seen as a form of scaremongering.

Denying access to birth control for non-medical reasons is not only unfair but also counterproductive to achieving gender equality and overall societal progress.," Some argue that birth control is not an essential service and that its provision should be subject to the moral and religious beliefs of employers and institutions, which could be compromised by mandated access.

Additionally, some believe that the cost of providing birth control could be a significant burden on employers and the healthcare system.",1,"The counter argument provided does not effectively oppose the claim example.

GMOs can increase crop yields and enhance food production to meet the growing global demand.," While some GMO crops have shown increased yields, numerous studies have found that the yield gains are often short-term and can be offset by increased pesticide use, soil degradation, and water pollution. Additionally, many GMO crops are engineered to be resistant to specific herbicides, which can lead to the development of ""superweeds"" that require even more toxic chemicals to control. This can ultimately undermine the long-term sustainability of GMO-based agriculture.",4,"The response effectively opposes the claim by presenting a strong argument against the use of GMOs.
