Expanding government powers should not be the preferred solution. Checks and balances in government institutions and a focus on promoting transparency and accountability can ensure effective governance without sacrificing citizens' rights and freedoms.,"While checks and balances are important for limiting power, they may be ineffective without a powerful entity to enforce them. Transparency and accountability are essential for efficient governance, but implementing them while preserving privacy and freedom is challenging. A limited government may be more susceptible to external influences, potentially leading to ineffective governance.",2,"The counter argument provided does oppose the claim, but it doesn't completely contradict it. While it does present a moderate level of opposition, it doesn't fully challenge the claim. The argument acknowledges the importance of checks and balances and transparency, but it also suggests that these elements may not be effective without a powerful entity to enforce them. This somewhat aligns with the claim, as it suggests that expanding government powers may be necessary for effective governance. The argument also mentions the potential vulnerability of a limited government to external influences, which could be seen as a form of agreement with the claim that a limited government is preferable.
