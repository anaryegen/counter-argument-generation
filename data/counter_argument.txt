The concept of "pivotal power" explains why politicians in the US prioritize the Jewish vote, despite Jews making up only a small percentage of the population. This is because supporting Israel is a crucial issue for American politics, particularly for evangelicals who make up 25% of the population and believe Israel must be protected for religious reasons. As a result, mainstream candidates must support Israel to win the support of Jewish voters, who are seen as a key bloc in determining the outcome of elections.
In certain situations, violent retribution can be seen as a redeeming act, such as when a wife, who has been physically and emotionally abused by her husband for 20 years, devises a violent death for him as a means of reclaiming her independence and individuality. In this context, the wife's violent retribution is viewed as the brave and moral choice. This perspective suggests that, in extreme cases of abuse, violent retribution can be a justified and empowering act.
There are over 3,000 federal laws, making it difficult to teach enough of the law in a single year or semester to inform someone of their rights. The complexity of the law, including criminal procedure, requires years of study for law students to grasp. A "know your rights" discussion is valuable, but the philosophy of "cooperate, say nothing, get a lawyer ASAP" does not take a semester or year to teach.
As a cyclist who recently received a ticket for running a stop sign, I am in favor of the Idaho Stop Law, which allows cyclists to treat stop signs as yield signs. I believe this law would improve traffic flow for both cyclists and motorists, and argue that it would make more sense for cyclists to proceed cautiously through intersections without stopping, rather than coming to a complete stop and unclipping. I also acknowledge that the law may not be suitable for densely populated areas, but I think it would be beneficial in other areas.
The laws prohibiting alcohol sales on Easter are proper because they benefit the economy, as taking a vacation day improves productivity and results in higher profits. I believe that such laws are not necessarily about religion, but about public safety and part of a shared cultural tradition. I suggest that secular countries can have laws restricting economic activity on religious holidays, such as Christmas and Easter, which have evolved into secular traditions.
I argue that allowing defendants to choose whether to testify is crucial because juries may unfairly judge them based on factors like appearance, voice, or emotional control, which can increase the risk of wrongful convictions. The Fifth Amendment protects against compelled self-incrimination to prevent coercion, unreliable testimony, and abuses of prosecutorial power that undermine the presumption of innocence. Forcing defendants to testify creates a dangerous dynamic where even innocent individuals may incriminate themselves or face unfair outcomes, ultimately increasing convictions of both the guilty and the innocent.
The left believes there is a "limiting principle" for government intervention in discrimination cases, specifically to address heightened levels of discrimination against minority groups. Requiring public accommodations to serve everyone is not forcing anyone to do something distasteful, as they would not offer the service to the public if it were immoral. "Religious freedom" is a subset of "freedom of conscience" and is an independent phenomenon that is cherished and not a misleading concept.  I argues that "religious freedom" is a clear and essential component of "freedom of conscience" that some are willing to fight for. 
The F-35 is a fifth-generation fighter designed for the future of air combat, with capabilities that drones cannot replicate, such as adaptability and human decision-making. The cost of the F-35 has come down significantly, with the A model approaching the $100 million per plane mark, and is expected to decrease further in full-rate production. The F-35 is being developed for export to provide stealth capabilities to US allies and will be important for the US to develop a plane that can be effective against modern SAM systems.
The military is an authoritarian institution that requires obedience as a core tenet to ensure the safety of its personnel, and desertion is a serious crime that can put people's lives at risk. When someone joins the military, they sign a contract that stipulates the punishment for desertion, and breaking this contract can have severe consequences. Desertion is not just a breach of contract, but also a betrayal of the people who relied on the individual to fulfill their duties, and it is not a morally justifiable act, even if it is a normal human desire to avoid punishment.
Your argument mirrors oil lobby talking points, but fracking contaminates water, worsens pollution, and accelerates climate change, potentially leaving trillions in property underwater. Energy independence sounds appealing, but it’s meaningless if it destroys the environment we depend on. History shows that America became a superpower by engaging in global trade, not isolationism, and collaboration often yields better outcomes for everyone.
It would be difficult to execute fairly and accurately, as real crises involve complex social, political, and contextual factors that cannot be effectively simulated. Simulations risk being overmanaged, unrealistic, or biased, and critics would likely debate their validity rather than focusing on candidate performance.  Traditional debates remain a more efficient way to evaluate candidates' policies, social skills, and decision-making at a fraction of the cost, while also shedding light on their personalities and priorities.
A mod team may implement stricter content curation through a series of small changes, avoiding a backlash that a single large change would provoke, illustrating the concept of a slippery slope. The slippery slope argument relies on demonstrating inevitability, which can be challenging when dealing with subjective decisions made by people with free will. Authorities rarely scale back censorship once it has been implemented, with very few examples of restrictions on free speech being loosened.
Relinquishing some privilege can be in one's self-interest, as it can prevent violence and resentment from those who feel underprivileged. Affirmative action and recognizing privilege can lead to a more equal society, where no one has advantages based on skin color, sexuality, or gender. A society that promotes universal principles and equality can benefit everyone, including those in positions of power.
If corporations continue to engage in espionage, it could lead to wars, which may become a lucrative way to obtain resources if humans are removed from the battlefield. They think that despite efforts to avoid global conflict, it is inevitable and will likely happen in their lifetime. Historically, international trade and colonization have led to great powers accumulating wealth and resources.
Planned Parenthood's officials' statements and actions on-camera are damning, not just the editing of the videos. While PP may provide other services, its abortion procedures, including late-term abortions and alleged harvesting of fetal tissue for profit, are morally wrong and inconsistent with American values. Also PP's founder had racist intentions and that the organization's clinics were initially located to "ethnically cleanse" neighborhoods.
The US is a union of states with its own laws and cultures, but it has a high homicide rate compared to the EU, partly due to clashes between different ethnic and socioeconomic groups. Closer economic union between European countries may have advantages and disadvantages, but a political union may not be beneficial as most countries feel they can govern themselves better than a central European government. A separate union for smaller countries could be an option, providing financial leverage and allowing them to maintain their social programs and sovereignty.
The Second Amendment is intended to protect the people's right to bear arms as a means of defense against tyranny and to balance the power equation between the governed and the governors. The amendment is not about safety, but about political power and control, and it has been historically used to justify the confiscation of firearms prior to heinous acts against a population. The people should retain a credible threat against the government, but this does not necessarily extend to owning heavy weapons like howitzers or missiles. 
Not voting can still be a valid form of protest, particularly when elections are perceived as rigged or when the choices are unsatisfactory. Voting may feel futile for some, especially in systems like the Electoral College, where individual votes may have little impact, or when both major parties are seen as equally disappointing. In this view, those who abstain from voting and reject both options arguably have the most right to criticize the results, as they did not endorse or validate a flawed system.
The government is not entirely untrustworthy and should not be given carte blanche, but it also can be counted on for certain things. The idea that every government is untrustworthy suggests that there is something inherently untrustworthy about the idea of government, and that no government is capable of behaving in a way that is deemed "trustworthy". The government's need for secrecy and its use of "spin" to push forward certain agendas can be seen as a criticism of its opacity, but it is also a necessary function of government to maintain its legitimacy and protect its citizens' interests.
An originalist interpretation would focus on the principles behind what was considered "excessive" in 1791, rather than fixed dollar amounts, accounting for the purchasing power and societal context of the time. Originalists would likely argue that fines and bails should be proportional to the crime and the individual's circumstances, as they were in 1791, rather than adhering rigidly to outdated monetary values. This approach reflects an understanding of evolving economic realities while maintaining the original intent to ensure fairness and prevent cruelty or inequality in punishment.
The purpose of the US military is to project and protect its interests worldwide, particularly economic interests such as oil, food, and goods. The military's role is to maintain stability in regions that are crucial to the global economy, and to respond to threats that could destabilize economies worldwide. The military's presence in the Middle East, for example, is necessary to ensure the flow of oil and to handle relations with countries that are unwilling to negotiate diplomatically. 
The values of individualism and self-reliance in the US allow insular cultures to exist independently, as long as membership in these communities remains a choice for the individuals within. This is in line with the idea that a splintered culture is better for maintaining individual rights over the collective. However, some insular communities may have social restrictions that limit individual freedom and equality, such as unequal treatment of women and limited privacy.
In the United States, being born into a white family has clear advantages and easier paths. All things being equal, it would be easier to be born into the majority, just like in China it would be easier to be born Chinese. In the US, minorities have disadvantages, including lower wages, lower college admission rates, and higher incarceration rates, making it advantageous to be born white.  In an alternate universe where everything is the same except for being born black instead of white, one's quality of life would likely be lower due to societal racism. 
The author argues that in many cases of police brutality, the victims did not pose a significant threat to the officers, and therefore, the use of lethal force was excessive. People have the right to resist arrest if they feel their rights are being violated, and that simply complying with police orders does not offer a solution to officers acting out of their authority. 
The Kurds are motivated by self-interest and material gains, and would cooperate with ISIS if it benefited them. Western support for the Kurds is complicated by the fact that a Kurdish state would require the surrender of land from Iraq, Turkey, and Syria, and that Western media has a pro-Western bias that oversimplifies and misrepresents the situation in the Middle East.
Lying to the FBI is not a crime if the lie does not matter and believes the penalty should be less severe, like a misdemeanor. However, I acknowledge that this view could encourage people to lie in legal investigations and that the materiality requirement in the law acts as a safeguard to prevent abuse. Proper use of the 5th amendment and having a lawyer present during FBI questioning can help mitigate potential problems with the law.
The current food distribution system is flawed because it's based on wealth, favoring the rich, and a proposed system to tax food based on consumption would not solve the issue of global hunger, which is caused by factors like war and poor distribution. The world produces enough food to feed everyone, but over 50% of it is wasted, and the problem of obesity is not solely caused by food consumption. Instead of taxing food, it would be more effective to work on improving the distribution system and addressing the root causes of global hunger.
Individuals held on terror-related charges have used personal hunger strikes to garner worldwide attention and pressure for change. Some may prefer to make a statement from within to change the system rather than just escaping. Regardless of guilt or innocence, anyone who escapes from prison can still be charged with crimes related to their jailbreak.
The US is the most trustworthy country to possess nuclear weapons due to its large military, stable government, and legitimacy as a state. In contrast, semi-failed states like Sudan, Nigeria, and Tunisia would be more dangerous with nuclear weapons as they could easily fall into the hands of terrorists. The US's use of atomic bombs in WWII is not comparable to the present day, as the weapons are much more powerful now and the country has a plethora of other options, making nuclear power a last resort.
Gentrification is a term coined by sociologists to describe a specific phenomenon, not a "social justice warrior" (SJW) term. The vocabulary used in social justice discussions is not elitist, but rather a specialized language meant to facilitate discussion among those familiar with the concepts, and it's not unreasonable to expect people to be familiar with basic terminology when discussing a subject. 
Each Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) should have its own requirements with the same standards for both sexes, but a basic test with different standards for men, women, and age is reasonable to ensure everyone is in shape and to not increase military healthcare costs. Having separate female regiments with different missions suited to their abilities could be beneficial. The military is not lowering the standard for any combat MOS.
The proposed retirement fund faces challenges like market volatility, which could unfairly disadvantage those retiring during a crash or born during market peaks. Additionally, a government-managed investment fund risks politicization and market distortion, as certain sectors could receive disproportionate benefits. Existing programs like Social Security and tax-sheltered accounts already address retirement savings without these complications.
The death penalty is not an appropriate punishment for armed robbery, as it is a massively asymmetrical punishment that does not take into account the circumstances of the crime or the perpetrator's intentions. The death penalty is not an effective deterrent, as it only has a small chance of deterring rational, calculating criminals, and that it is also morally wrong because it risks executing innocent people. Additionally, rehabilitation and prevention are more effective ways to address crime, and that the death penalty is also extremely expensive.
The issue of building a wall along the US-Mexico border is not considered racist by the general public, as it can be framed as a "national security" issue rather than an immigration issue. Certain communities should be able to choose their K-12 language options, such as Spanish in areas with a high Hispanic population, but notes that English is still the dominant language in many areas. Securing borders and deporting illegal immigrants are different issues, which is not racist, and not racism against Latinos, which is not significant compared to racism against other groups.
The American people should push back against the media's tendency to focus on out-of-context soundbites, as this hinders constructive public discourse. As citizens, it is our responsibility to demand accountability from both elected officials and the news media. A politician's ability to never misspeak or make hollow speeches is not an indicator of their potential as a good legislator or executive.
Racism stems from a feeling of superiority over a different race, and the degradation of a person because of their race is a notable issue, particularly in the US where skin color affects how one is viewed. Facial recognition is also connected to perceptions and empathy at a primal biological level. Everything is a mix of cultures, and that cultural exchange and preservation should not come at the cost of racist treatment.
Responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities is already encouraged and that forcing companies to improve their security creates a safer place for the future. Sharing computer security information has benefits, including making everyone safer, but also has downsides, such as revealing trade secrets and vulnerabilities. Many companies have bounty programs to encourage vulnerability testing, but a legal framework for sharing computer security information between companies, individuals, and government entities is needed to balance safety and protection of proprietary information.
The main cause of California's water demands is agricultural usage, accounting for 80% or more of the state's water usage, rather than citizen usage. Reducing the population would not have a significant impact on water usage unless millions of people were relocated. Implementing smarter agricultural policies would be a more efficient and cost-effective solution than relocating urban residents.
The German Social Democratic Party (SPD) is declining due to various reasons, including the Agenda 2010, which led to unpopular cuts, and the similarity between the SPD and the conservative party (CDU), making it hard for voters to distinguish between them. The European left has been weak in recent years, but there are signs of a resurgence, with left-wing parties like Die Linke in Germany, Sinn Fein in Ireland, and Podemos in Spain gaining power. Despite losses in recent elections, left-wing parties have successfully maintained core principles such as universal healthcare and free university tuition in many European countries.
Denying someone a job due to mental impairment is not an issue of rights, but rather one of fitness for the specific profession. Certain mental health conditions can severely conflict with the duties and responsibilities of a job, posing a risk to the individual or society. It's not about discrimination, but about ensuring the person can perform the job safely and effectively.
Animals lack the self-awareness to understand morality, so killing them isn't murder. Ethics are based on social contracts and reason, which animals can't engage in. Given human needs and practical issues like food deserts, eating meat is justifiable, and ethical systems can't be universally applied to animals or hypothetical alien situations.
I question the effectiveness of raising the minimum wage to $15, as it could lead to higher prices and the need for another wage increase. The evidence on minimum wage seems inconclusive, with short-term studies from countries with long histories of minimum wage, and businesses may have already made adjustments. I also notice that countries with high minimum wages, like Spain, Greece, and France, often have high unemployment rates, while Singapore, with no minimum wage, has low unemployment. 
Colleges do not owe students due process in the same way that criminal courts do, as the consequences of expulsion are not as severe as imprisonment. Colleges have their own rules and processes for handling accusations, including sexual assault, and students agree to these rules when they attend. While the process may not be as rigorous as a criminal trial, it is still legitimate and students who feel wrongfully expelled may be able to sue the university in civil court.
Exposing the general public to extremist ideologies is not necessary due to the risks involved and the lack of qualifications among the general public to properly analyze and understand them. Instead, experts such as top-notch psychiatrists should be given more exposure to gain a better understanding of these ideologies and how to alleviate them. The current media coverage of mass murderers is damaging and potentially fuels new ones.
Government intervention interferes with the free market, which is contrary to pure capitalism. Historically, capitalism has been the best option to incentivize the production of physical goods in a world with abundant natural resources. However, in a future where physical work is performed by robots and software only needs to be written once, capitalism may not be the best option.
65 % of new citizens are over the age of 35, meaning they couldn't make a presidential run until they are at least 70. you can't become a naturalized citizen until you are 18 ( except in certain special circumstances ), meaning you have a lower limit of age 53 for immigrants. arnold schwarzenegger became a citizen in 1983, meaning he would not be eligible for to run for president until 2018.
Altering the punishment alone will not lead to significant gains for society. Also judges, despite their flaws, are more objective than the general public in meting out punishments, and a more effective approach would be to focus on rehabilitation and reintegration into society rather than punishment and exile. 
The mods of this forum allow even retrograde viewpoints to be freely discussed, believing open and honest discussion is the best way to change minds, as expressed in John Stuart Mill's "On Liberty". Freedom of speech means freedom from lynch mob consequences, and people should not face harassment or bankruptcy for expressing their opinions. The concept of freedom of speech is not limited to governments, but is also seen as a general human right, and private entities like tech companies should not restrict one side of a discussion while allowing the other.
The core libertarian claim is not that private charity is more effective than state assistance, but rather that people's selfishness cancels out. Libertarians assume that people are selfish in all situations, including government workers, and therefore favor limiting the power of the government. In contrast, communism is built on the idea that people can act selflessly and donate to society as a whole, which can provide a safety net for those in need.
Defining "spam" in a way that targets spammers without violating free speech rights is nearly impossible. On Reddit, the majority of spam comes from professional operations in Pakistan and India, who create thousands of accounts and build up karma before spamming. These spammers often target specific subreddits, such as /r/healthyfood, which has an 80% spam rate.
Carrying a gun without proper proficiency and training can be dangerous, and even for experienced gun owners, carrying a weapon is not a simple solution to personal safety. The risks, including potential accidents and contributing to illegal gun circulation, often outweigh the benefits, and I think carrying a concealed weapon should be reserved for those who have received extensive training and truly need it.
Even advocates not financially backed by unions are pushing for a minimum wage, and that the government cannot simply "pull money out of a hat" to fund it, as the majority of the bill would fall to taxpayers, particularly the lower middle class. I suggest that a "buffer zone" income bracket could mitigate the effect of increased income taxes on the lower middle class, but notes that this idea is not mentioned in the original op. Most economists oppose a higher minimum wage, citing evidence that the bulk of experts in the field believe it would help the economy.
Studies suggest that raising the minimum wage to $12.50 could increase the number of jobs by around 48,000 due to increased consumer spending, particularly by lower-income individuals who are more likely to spend additional income
I believe it's unfair to hold me accountable for the actions of my ancestors, like slavery or segregation, since privilege isn’t something I can renounce. While historical injustices exist, it’s impossible to fix every wrong, and we should focus on providing equal opportunities for all. Granting reparations could fuel more racial tensions rather than heal them, and real change needs to come from within communities to improve standards of living.
Banning substances like marijuana is ineffective, as people will still find ways to access them through the black market, and instead drives criminal enterprise and directs money to drug dealers. If marijuana is considered harmful, then more harmful substances like caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco should also be banned. 
Fascists believe that individuals should put the good of the nation before their own personal interests and that the government should intervene in the economy to mediate disputes between employers and employees. In practice, fascist countries had economies where private business was subordinate to the government. Fascism is not inherently racist, anti-racist fascist ideologies such as Brazilian and Portuguese integralism as an example.  Donald Trump  never suggested that all Mexicans are degenerates, but rather that those who illegally immigrate to the US are likely the degenerates of Mexican society. 
The proposed system, Omniwatch, would be vulnerable to security breaches due to human error, as many operators would have access to it. Even if the system itself is secure, it would be easy to trick or blackmail an operator into allowing access, and the system's coverage would not be perfect, allowing individuals to avoid detection. Additionally, the system could be used for blackmail, disrupting political organizations, and selectively enforcing laws, making it a threat to privacy and individual freedom.
The US government's plan to confiscate money from offshore accounts would encourage expats to hide their money in local spouses' accounts and lead to tax evasion. The $32 trillion in offshore accounts is a global number, not just American, and the estimated loss of tax revenue is $280 billion, not $900 billion. Confiscating this money would be an invasion of sovereign nations and undermine trust in the US government, as it would be taking money from people who have broken no laws.
The Affordable Care Act (ACA) mandates that healthy people buy insurance to balance out the costs of insuring those with pre-existing conditions, who would otherwise be denied coverage or charged exorbitant rates. Without the mandate, insurers would drop coverage for sick people, and those with chronic conditions would end up in emergency rooms with no way to pay for care. The ACA requires insurers to cover everyone, regardless of pre-existing conditions, and prohibits them from charging different premiums based on health status.
Google's existence and size are not inherently problematic, and it's possible that without Google, other companies like Bing or Microsoft would take over the market. Google's economies of scale allow it to provide useful services and benefits, such as laying fiber and reducing alcohol-related deaths. The argument that Google is powerful because the government might force it to do things is actually a statement about the government's power, not Google's.
The problems within the euro zone are largely due to long-term trade deficits, particularly between Germany and peripheral European states, which violate euro rules. If European states were to agree to play by the rules and take steps to end these chronic trade imbalances, there would be a monetary transfer to counteract the imbalances, allowing for easier trade and fiscal stability. The preservation of the euro depends on Germany's willingness to change its business practices and play fair.
The Chattanooga attacks may have been motivated by personal reasons rather than a political or ideological goal.  Anything that strikes immediate, intentional, and lasting fear into a population could be deemed a terrorist attack. 
Marriage is a right that has been affirmed by the Supreme Court 14 times over 115 years. No one is forced to get married, unlike slavery, and that the LGBT community wants to get married to gain greater societal acceptance. 
Donald Trump's business blunders, including bankruptcies, are a concern, and his plan to bring manufacturing back to the US is addressing a symptom rather than the problem of income inequality. Trump's strategy to deploy a large number of US troops to the Middle East to secure oil fields would be a massive own goal, entailing high casualty counts and widespread loss of life. His lack of political experience and inability to collaborate with others, including world leaders and nations, make him an unsuitable candidate for the presidency.
Recessions cause layoffs, business failures, and decreased stock values, but increased public spending during these periods can help keep the working class employed and the economy growing. Keynesian economic policy is designed to offset the negative effects of free market capitalist economies, where capital tends to accumulate faster than other types of income, leading to asset bubbles and economic instability. This policy is not about "class warfare," but rather about solving the challenges of the time and promoting economic growth.
Unrestricted migration would burden developed countries due to the financial strain of providing services to migrants, leading to overcrowded slums and increased crime. If migrants from corrupt countries move to developed ones, they might bring those political issues with them. Open borders would disrupt local economies and culture, with immigrants often flocking to areas offering the most benefits, and the country's resources, like healthcare and infrastructure, would be stretched thin.
I live in Australia, a two-party system with compulsory voting, and I don't think this will lead to fewer attack ads. Research shows that negative ads are effective, and if candidates know everyone is voting, they may rely on them even more to sway undecided voters. Making everyone vote is unlikely to change how candidates campaign or inform uninformed voters about their platforms.
Implementing IUDs or sterilization for welfare recipients is not only cost-ineffective but also immoral, as it involves an invasive and potentially painful medical procedure with side effects, and denies people their autonomy and dignity. This approach is based on a stereotype that welfare recipients are "good for nothing wastes of space", when in fact, many households receive welfare at some point. This approach would be more expensive than the current system, would deny people who are religious access to welfare, and would ultimately be humiliating and dehumanizing.
The focus should be on practical solutions like improving food production and energy methods, rather than expecting individuals to drastically change their lifestyles. While climate change is a major concern, current issues like world hunger, which directly affect people today, should take priority. In light of immediate threats like hunger, global instability, and economic failure, climate change may not warrant the singular focus it currently has.
A president who does nothing and refuses to nominate anyone for key positions would lead to a dysfunctional government with unfilled positions, unenforced laws, and unmanaged finances. The president plays a crucial role in creating and signing the budget, maintaining foreign relations, and enforcing laws, and their inaction would have severe consequences. Without a president, many good laws would expire, and new laws would be difficult to pass, which would not necessarily be a positive outcome.
The Empire stopped using clones due to the loss of cloning facilities and issues with unstable clones. Although some stormtroopers were still clone troopers, not all of them were clones of Jango Fett, as the 501st legion was the only one consisting of Fett clones. The Empire also opened civilian conscription, but clones remained the main force.
Making fun of people is bad, but it happens in any school, and that immigration can make a culture more interesting and diverse. I believe that too much immigration can marginalize a previously ethnic majority, but also I think that the benefits of having diverse cultures within a country outweigh the potential drawbacks. I grew up in a diverse neighborhood with family members from different cultural backgrounds, and I believe that immigration is a natural part of our changing world.
The killing of foxes can be useful for protecting animal stocks in areas with a lot of poultry farming, and banning it could have a cost, such as the foxes continuing to kill chickens. In contrast, banning the killing of foxes for sport only deprives hunters of their fun, without any significant cost. The ban on fox hunting was likely passed because many people found the idea of humans taking pleasure in killing a defenseless animal to be an affront to their values.
Equal opportunities mean giving everyone a fair chance to demonstrate their worth and earn a position of power based on their qualifications, not just giving anyone a position regardless of their qualifications. I believe that this approach leads to the most qualified people acquiring positions of power, and that it is not about giving everyone an equal outcome, but rather an equal chance. The current state of inequality is not meritocratic, and equal opportunities would allow people to compete on equal grounds and the better one to win.
The US government owns mostly reserved property for preservation and conservation, and subleasing or renting it out could compromise safety and the intended functions of these lands. Allowing a trust to manage these properties for profit could lead to exploitation and neglect of conservation and preservation goals. The government should maintain control over these lands to ensure sustainable use and prevent them from being put on the chopping block during budget crises.
The effort to control Europe is ultimately doomed to fail, as seen in the cases of the Romans and Napoleon, who despite being a great leader and general, was unable to sustain his empire due to the separation of Europe into separate nations. Napoleon's mistakes, including his failure to turn back from Moscow and his lack of tactics in big battles, further contributed to his downfall, and even if he had won at Waterloo, he would have still faced opposition from the British and other European nations. 
When voting, one should understand the implications of their choice, such as voting for Candidate X meaning higher taxes to support lower-income individuals, or voting for Candidate Y meaning lower corporate taxes with the hope of investment. Voting should be based on understanding these implications rather than simply voting along party lines. This approach emphasizes the importance of informed decision-making in the voting process.
The Supreme Court's power is limited because it can only make law but has no means of enforcing it, and its power is only recognized as long as the other two branches decide to do so. The Court has no power of impeachment and can only rule on cases brought to them, with no ability to override Congress or the President. While the Supreme Court's rulings are final, its power is restricted in scope compared to the other branches, which have more flexibility to effect political change.
The swastika is a Hindu symbol, but the specific swastika associated with Nazi Germany is not used as a religious symbol by Hindus. The Nazi flag and Confederate flag, once having positive connotations, now have negative connotations due to their association with segregation, ethnic cleansing, and slavery. It's unrealistic to expect people who have grown up associating these symbols with tragedies to simply forget their negative connotations.
Nationalism can be detrimental to cultural thriving, and that a vibrant culture should embrace differences within it. Local culture does not have to be tied to national boundaries, as an example, the southern US having a distinct culture without needing nationalism. Strict adherence to national identity can lead to cultural stagnation and the suppression of minority cultures, such as Romani, Tamil, Sikh, and Palestinian cultures.
Socialism is unworkable in practice, as it requires a central authority to determine the value of goods and services, which is a difficult task. In contrast, capitalism, with its free market and price mechanism, is better able to allocate resources and drive innovation. A hybrid system, such as market socialism, may be a viable alternative, but ultimately a humane and workable system can be achieved by patching free-market capitalism with social welfare policies.
Using a Molotov cocktail against another human being is horrific, but it's not the police's job to punish people for their crimes, rather to keep the peace and apprehend criminals. Lethal force should be a last resort, especially in situations where innocent bystanders may be injured, and that police should consider the circumstances before using it. Police should prioritize de-escalation and arrest over lethal force, even in situations where a protester is throwing a Molotov cocktail, in order to avoid fueling further violence and riots.
Free press and freedom of assembly are crucial for holding governments accountable and allowing citizens to express dissent and bring about change. Restricting citizens' rights and privacy can ultimately lead to more civil unrest and that the idea of sacrificing human rights for prosperity is often used as a tool by those in power to maintain their position.
The austerity measures imposed on Greece deepened its recession, increasing its debt-to-GDP ratio and worsening its economic crisis. The EU's current approach prioritizes debt repayment through continued austerity, leaving Greece in a perpetual state of economic decline without addressing its unsustainable debt. Alternatives like debt forgiveness or investment to stimulate growth could have been more effective, but the current plan benefits creditors while keeping Greece in financial limbo.
The problem with many countries'electoral systems is that they are biased towards larger parties, making it difficult for smaller parties to have a significant impact. In a multi-party system, the winning party often has the power to form a government without needing to include smaller parties, and even if they do need to form a coalition, they will typically only take the minimum number of additional parties necessary. This can lead to smaller parties being "frozen out" of the government, making it often in the voter's best interest to support the most popular party they can tolerate.
Income inequality is a pressing issue because many people working full-time still cannot meet basic living standards, while wealth remains concentrated at the top. While financial education is important for improving individual outcomes, systemic measures like fair wealth distribution through taxation and investment in public resources are critical to addressing structural inequality. History shows that policies combining progressive taxation and education, as seen in the post-WWII era, can effectively reduce inequality and raise living standards for everyone.
Piracy, while morally and legally wrong, often emerges from frustration with restrictive or outdated business practices, such as the refusal of music labels to embrace digital distribution or the monopolistic control of industries. Historically, piracy has driven significant change, from the rise of digital platforms like Steam to the resurgence of interest in obscure art through file sharing. Although creators deserve fair compensation, many argue that copyright laws, which are a relatively modern invention, should balance incentivizing creators with accessibility for consumers.
North Korea was not a realistic invasion target in the 90s due to the costs of war outweighing the benefits, and China's consistent backing of North Korea made it an even more daunting task. The threat of China's intervention on behalf of North Korea would lead to a catastrophic outcome, such as World War 3. The perceived threat of invasion is not enough to justify nuclear proliferation, as an example of Saudi Arabia potentially pursuing nuclear weapons, which would create a new reason for Iran to do the same.
Distinction between athletes competing in sports and non-athletes seeking a certain physique for aesthetic reasons, arguing that the latter group may also face pressure to use steroids to remain competitive in the dating and job markets. The concern about steroids creating competitive pressure on non-users is more compelling than the fact that it's against the rules. The same logic that makes steroid use wrong in sports should also apply to non-athletes, as it can lead to a "race to the bottom" where people feel pressured to use steroids to remain competitive.
Reducing non-problematic alcohol use is pointless, as it does not address the harmful cases of alcohol use, which are a small fraction of total alcohol use. Targeted interventions, such as preventing excessive drinking and drunk driving, are more effective. Moderate alcohol use has health benefits, such as reducing cardiovascular disease, and 70-80% of people drink responsibly, while 10% drink too much and 10% are struggling with addiction. 
The electoral college system in the US allows presidential candidates to win the presidency without receiving the most popular votes, as the representatives from each state carry the votes of their constituents. This system gives candidates a reason to focus on states with small populations and can lead to a clear winner even when the popular vote is close. The electoral college also rewards candidates who have broad support across the country, rather than just strong support from a few smaller segments, making it easier for the president to govern effectively.
Libertarians distinguish between political entrepreneurs, who use government intervention to gain advantages, and market entrepreneurs, who rely on efficiency and competition. Government protections often create monopolies and stifle competition, whereas free markets naturally limit monopolies by encouraging innovation and attracting competitors. Historical examples, like government-sanctioned pollution exemptions, show how interventions blamed on market failures are often the result of political favoritism.
San Francisco has a large undocumented population due to its proximity to agricultural industries that attract migrant labor and its historical ties to Mexico. The city has chosen to become a sanctuary city to protect the human rights of all persons, regardless of citizenship status, as it believes that immigrants will be better local citizens if they feel comfortable engaging with the local government without fear of deportation. This decision is also based on the fact that immigrants tend to be law-abiding and peaceful, and that the city does not have the capacity to enforce federal immigration laws.
The main difference between a blue dog democrat and a minority coalition party is that repeated crossing of the aisle doesn't trigger a new election in the US system. The representativeness of a legislative body is more dependent on the election and districting systems than on the type of government system. The US two-party system can alienate some members of the spectrum, while greater party discipline in the parliamentary system can increase representation.
The world would be a better place if El Chapo had been extradited. Even the most powerful drug lords in Mexico have recently fallen. The drug war has been a waste of money for the US and destructive for Mexico.
Government officials, particularly politicians, have significant control over economic growth through policies such as tax cuts and spending. Economic policy can be complex and have unintended consequences, but correct government action can "grow the economy," especially in times of crisis. The writer cites examples such as FDR's New Deal and the 2007-2009 recession, where stimulus spending in the US and austerity measures in the EU had differing effects on economic growth.
A world government is a plausible outcome due to the global nature of economic activity and the need for solutions to global problems such as climate change, terrorism, and regulating multinational corporations. They envision a "federal" system with a weak central government, similar to the European Union, that will gradually gain more power as the need for global governance increases. Technological advancements could lead to a more homogeneous world, making a global confederation more likely, and a world government could be an efficient way to distribute resources and ensure the survival of the human species.
The idea of reducing the world to one culture to eliminate conflict is flawed, as it would also eliminate the value and advantages gained from multiple perspectives. Diversity is essential for humanity's survival, as it protects us biologically and provides different points of view. Eliminating cultural differences would require stripping away people's personal connections to their languages, religions, and customs, effectively manufacturing an army of clones with no free will.
Discussing politics in public is a basic requirement of democracy and can help change minds over time, even if people initially disagree. It's possible to discuss politics with people you disagree with without offending them, and it can lead to new insights and perspectives. The key is to be selective about who you talk to and how you approach the conversation.
The American Dream is about providing opportunities for the poorest and most desperate individuals to succeed through hard work, regardless of their origins. The idea is that in a free and fair society, these individuals will blossom into comfortable citizens, making accepting impoverished masses no burden. This idealistic policy is at the core of American identity, and dismantling it would mean abandoning the values represented by the Statue of Liberty.
The current situation in Greece is not a success or failure of a set of policies, but rather a negotiation due to the country's unsustainably high debts. The anti-austerity movement is not advocating for a return to Greece's policies of 10 years ago, but rather for the country to admit its financial struggles, default, and start over, potentially by leaving the eurozone. The crisis in Greece is not a defeat of left-wing ideology, but rather a result of high borrowing, flaws in the economy, and the flaws of a single currency, exacerbated by austerity measures.
A police motorcycle can save $28.20 in gas expenses daily compared to a car, and with a maximum price of $15k, the gas savings alone would pay for the bike in 3 years. The motorcycle would likely be used for up to 10 years and then sold. For larger police departments like the NYPD, motorcycles would be suitable for traffic police and single-officer patrols, but not for transporting suspects or partners.
Kashmir's ruler in 1947 wanted the region to remain a neutral, independent country, separate from both Pakistan and India. A large independence movement remains, with the Kashmiri people viewing Kashmir as a single, indivisible entity. The British partition plan would have cut a sovereign country in half, disregarding the Kashmiri right to self-government.
Obama was a decent president but not excellent, as his actions were not necessarily good for everyone in the country. His failures include the handling of the Iran nuclear deal, the continuation of drone strikes and support for terrorism, and the refusal to prosecute members of the previous administration for torture and war crimes. 
If businesses cannot make a profit, they cannot sustain paying employees, leading to layoffs and economic instability. Raising the minimum wage too high could cause inflation, making goods and services more expensive, which disproportionately harms lower-income individuals who may not see proportional wage increases.
Scandinavian countries exemplify a form of capitalism with strong social policies, achieving significant economic equality, unlike the United States, where unchecked capitalism fosters inequality and limits economic growth. While capitalism has historically reduced global poverty and inequality, achieving true equality is impossible due to differences in natural abilities and circumstances.
The concept of money as free speech primarily benefits corporations, which creates problems for corporate reliability and consumer welfare, and allows for unequal representation of private interests in politics based on standards other than majority view. This leads to the conclusion that the United States is not functionally a democracy, but an oligarchy. 
Legalizing prostitution may fail to protect those outside regulated systems and foster competition with a cheaper illegal market, as seen in Nevada, where most prostitution remains unlicensed. Evidence suggests legal markets can shield illegal activities and increase human trafficking, while societal stigma deters participation in the legal sector. 
If the US were to split into two countries along party lines, both countries would likely become single-party states or experience internal party variations, leading to a recursive loop of new political parties and potentially 320 million different countries. The split would also throw US treaty obligations into chaos, cause issues for people who work in one state and live in another, and create problems for the military and economy. 
The person who took a federal agent's parking spot is personally responsible for a woman's death, as the agent's gun was stolen from their car and used in the crime. San Francisco's sanctuary city policy is designed to allow the immigrant community to interact with law enforcement and that the city arrests and prosecutes illegal immigrants in the same way as any other person. The blame for the woman's death is on the media and political support that enabled the mayor's decisions, rather than on a single person.
Coates' views on the American Dream are based on his life experiences, particularly his childhood in Baltimore, and he believes that the Dream is rooted in oppression. He argues that the Dream's existence relies on the oppression of certain groups, and that it would not exist in its current state in a just society. In contrast, I think the American Dream is about having the opportunity to pursue one's own goals and having access to real opportunities, which would be strengthened if oppression were eliminated.
Bernie Sanders' campaign is not about making promises that he can't keep, but rather about starting a grassroots movement to increase voter turnout and push for progressive change. He understands that he can't accomplish everything on his own and needs the support of Congress and the American people to make real change happen. His goal is to inspire people to want change and to elect a Congress that will support his proposals, rather than relying solely on his own power as president. 
The current voting system in the US creates a dynamic where presidential candidates avoid accountability, change their stance, and owe favors. Almost 40% of Americans do not identify with the two major political parties, yet nearly 100% of Congress does, making it difficult for Congress to fairly represent the country. The two-party system hurts the US the worst in domestic policy, with a high incumbent re-election rate and a lack of contested primary elections.
Undocumented immigrants are still needed to perform jobs that Americans are unwilling to do, despite efforts to seal borders and villainize them. Immigrants, both legal and illegal, have a positive impact on the economy, boosting labor demand and wages for US workers, and it is unrealistic to maintain the current pathway to legal immigration and deport all undocumented immigrants at the same time.
Leftist economic ideas are inherently selfish because they require coercion by the government to redistribute wealth from one person to another. The use of force by the government is immoral, and the leftist idea of wealth redistribution is like unclogging a water filter every couple of seconds after it gets clogged again. Right-wing views, on the other hand, are based on the idea that individuals should be able to reap the rewards of their efforts and that the government should not force people to help others.
The media is not intentionally trying to distract people with irrelevant details of a case, but rather trying to create a spin to draw in viewers and turn a profit. The goal of the media is to provide entertainment and get views, not to distract people from reality, but this can still have the effect of distracting from the main issue.
If financial abortion is an option, there will likely be fewer babies in situations where the parents are not financially prepared. People respond to incentives, and the lack of money is a significant incentive, especially since abortion is an option and many babies in these situations are not really unwanted. The current child support system is often unfair to men, and financial abortion could be a more practical solution than forcing men to pay child support they cannot afford.  
Greece cannot be blamed for not recovering after the bailout, as austerity measures only cause the economy to stagnate. I believe that requiring Greece to fix the economy with austerity is counterproductive, and that continuing to have Greek debts on the books in the short term is actually good for Germany. 
Police brutality is a worsening problem in the US, exacerbated by a lack of internal discipline and controls within police departments. The issue is not just individual cases, but a systemic problem that is not being adequately addressed. The media is not "hyping" police brutality, but rather, the widespread availability of cameras and social media has made it easier to expose and report on instances of brutality that were previously ignored or disbelieved.
The idea that everyone can agree on a sane, rational issue if "politics" and "special interests" got out of the way is a fantasy. Bernie Sanders' approach to politics and campaigning is worth celebrating as he focuses exclusively on actual issues. Tragedies are what inevitably lead to action, and it's necessary to talk about them while they're still fresh in our minds to see progress.
Raising the minimum wage to $15/hour would have a positive effect on the overall market, despite some potential negative consequences such as layoffs and price increases. The benefits to the lower and middle classes, who would see a significant increase in their buying power, would outweigh the losses. Historically, raising the minimum wage has not led to massive job cuts, and that companies would likely absorb the increased labor costs through modest price increases rather than cutting staff.
While everyone is entitled to free speech, they are not entitled to others' silence or money. They believe that if they don't want to support someone's speech, they can choose not to pay for it, such as by canceling a subscription. The writer also notes that freedom of speech means being able to express one's views without government retribution, but it doesn't prevent others from reacting to those views.
Stripping citizenship from individuals who join foreign conflicts, such as those who fight with ISIS, is not meant as a punishment but rather a practical attempt to deal with a new kind of conflict between state and non-state actors. This measure is necessary to prevent non-state actors from exploiting the structure of their opponents, including citizenship rules. Repatriating and imprisoning ISIS fighters could have unintended consequences, such as radicalizing other individuals in prison.
The US Constitution's rigidity was intentionally designed by the founders to preserve foundational rights, limit corruption, and ensure longevity by requiring broad support for amendments. This deliberate difficulty prevents rash decisions and allows successive generations to reinterpret the document for their needs while maintaining stability. Issues like gun violence stem from enforcement failures, such as the prevalence of unregistered firearms, rather than flaws in the Constitution itself, which has adapted over time through interpretation.
Morality is not an absolute thing, but rather a mechanism that societies use to encourage behavior that is in everyone's best interest. In the case of loan repayment, it is immoral to default on a loan when one is able to repay it, as it harms other borrowers who would have repaid their loans and makes the business of lending money less profitable. 
In the UK, people have the right to express their views and protest, but the city cannot discriminate between religions due to legal and constitutional constraints. Objections to building mosques are often rooted in discrimination against the religious, but there may be other reasons, such as concerns about noise, aesthetics, or impact on the local community. In some cases, objections to mosques are not about the religion itself, but about the potential consequences of building a mosque, such as attracting a new population or changing the character of the neighborhood.
The problem with preserving a country's culture from immigration is that it's difficult to define a native population, especially in countries with complex histories of colonization and power changes. Many countries, such as Canada and Brazil, have successfully integrated diverse populations and proven that ethnic heterogeneity can be beneficial. The idea of preserving a country's culture through restricted immigration is subjective and often based on sentimentality, nationalism, and bias, rather than objective historical or factual reasons.
The difficulty of discussing complex topics in simple language and appreciates the challenge of conveying ideas without using technical jargon is aknowledged. Hypothetical scenario where Greece declares war on Germany, surrenders, and then has its debts written off, highlighting the difference between debt caused by damage versus structural issues as an example. 
A flat tax is unfair because it shifts the tax burden from the wealthy to the poor and middle class, and that it is not an effective way to stimulate economic growth. The current progressive tax system is designed to be fair, with higher tax rates for those who can afford it, and a flat tax would eliminate this fairness. The idea that lower tax rates massively boost the economy is overplayed, and that the wealthy would be the main beneficiaries of a flat tax plan. 
Countries regulate the sale of specific goods when the interests of the seller and buyer are opposed in obvious, harmful ways. A seller of pencils has an incentive to sell high-quality pencils cheaply, as it aligns with both their own and the consumer's interests. This is an example of a situation where regulation may not be necessary.
Patriotism does not necessarily mean believing one's own country is superior to others. A more positive form of patriotism acknowledges one's own country's greatness while also recognizing the greatness of other countries. The removal of patriotism would lead to a lack of societal cohesion, as people would no longer have a sense of belonging to a particular group or community.
Voting as an individual has little impact on the outcome of an election. However, voting for a third-party candidate can be significant in helping them maintain a certain percentage of the vote to remain on the ballot for the next election cycle. The primary election serves a different purpose than the general election, as it is meant to elect the best candidate for that party.
The purpose of government is to protect people's rights and maximize human wellbeing, not just to protect property rights. Libertarians and objectivists have a flawed view of government and taxation, and that paying taxes is a necessary part of living in a society that provides benefits like roads, schools, and law enforcement.
The dark mark of slavery in American history is true, but note that the massive economic growth of the US took place after the Civil War and was not primarily driven by slave labor. Despite its problems, current day America has a reasonably functional government, low crime rates, and a strong economy, and that it's possible to be proud of one's country while recognizing room for improvement. 
2% of the country being bullied cannot solve the problem on their own without the help of neutrals. The LGBT community cannot solve the problem of bullying by non-LGBT people on their own. Complacency hinders the achievement of social justice for LGBT individuals, and people outside the community need to help, as seen in the example of straight people ending the ban on gay marriage.
Banning the Confederate flag is not equivalent to destroying history, as it is a mass-produced symbol that can still be viewed in museums and history books. In contrast, ISIS destroying ancient artifacts is a destruction of history, as these artifacts are irreplaceable and essential to learning about ancient cultures. 
The US government owes reparations to every military member who has ever served in the United States military, as they protected wealth and freedom for US citizens, generating capital that was taxed by the government. The government's wealth is a direct result of the military's efforts, and that the descendants of military members are entitled to reparations. 
Catholics are not morally culpable for the actions of corrupt clergy members, as the Church's teachings and rules condemn child abuse and the institution is not responsible for the actions of its members. The Church has taken steps to address the issue and that supporting the Church financially does not necessarily mean supporting the corrupt actions of a few. 
NATO is crucial for US interests and global stability, providing a framework for coordination of military assets, legitimacy, and international consensus to military expeditions. The alliance also offers the US significant benefits, including free-passage, logistical support, and additional troops, which enhance its military power and influence. Furthermore, NATO's existence helps to deter Russian aggression and provides a powerful diplomatic tool for the US, allowing it to leverage its position as the defender of Europe against European countries.
Every state has its own constitution and supreme court, with many justices directly elected. This system does not appear to compromise the checks and balances in those states. An appointed court can be either corrupt or diligent and just, just like an elected one.
Even though one's individual vote may seem insignificant, it still has an impact on the outcome of an election, citing examples of state elections being decided by only a couple hundred votes. Voting is a way to exert social pressure and encourage cooperation, and that not voting can lead to a lack of representation for one's political ideals. 
When people have access to more data points, they can generalize from a more accurate representation of a group, rather than a skewed sample. On hot-button issues, people respond to evidence, but it often doesn't bring them closer together. Instead, people tend to incorporate facts into their existing worldview, and it's the inconsistencies in their internal logic that can lead to a change in their views.
The definition of libertarian would need to be changed to accommodate immigration, as seen in the politicians that actual libertarians have elected and supported, such as Ron Paul, Rand Paul, and Gary Johnson, who have all been successful despite not being "pure" libertarians.  The libertarian candidate who has obtained the most votes was Gary Johnson, who is considered "impure" but has successfully functioned as a governor. 
Having the right to defend oneself is a natural right, and guns are the most effective means of self-defense, making them a necessary tool for equalizing disparities in physical strength and ability. Taking away firearms would leave citizens vulnerable to attack and unable to defend themselves, and that gun bans are unlikely to reduce violent crime rates.
Nearly 50% of minimum wage workers are either the sole or one of two incomes in a household relying on their income, and providing jobs that do not provide a meaningful income is useless. A higher minimum wage only affects those currently below it, and either they get a raise or they get fired, with the latter case not resulting in much value lost to the economy. In Germany, a minimum wage of 8.50 € since January 2015 has resulted in at least 2 million people earning more money, but around 100,000 fewer workplaces for low-qualified people.
The proposed system where renters gain ownership of a property after 20 years of renting would be disastrous, as it would drastically reduce the availability of rental properties, lead to chaos in managing multiple owners, and force renters to pay mortgage prices upfront. This system would essentially eliminate renting as an option and make buying the only viable choice, which would have negative effects on several economies. 
16 and 17-year-olds may be able to argue their positions to local representatives, especially since they will soon be eligible to vote. The drinking age has not been lowered in any state due to federal highway funds being tied to the drinking age being 21, and a massive shift in Congress would be needed to change this. Politicians are able to represent all their constituents, including those under 18, and counting only eligible voters would not be worth the effort due to the quickly changing demographics.
The disagreement around the term "racism" stems from differing definitions, with some using it to describe prejudice and others using it to describe prejudice combined with power. If people who use "racism" to mean prejudice were to use "prejudice" instead, and those who use it to mean prejudice plus power were to use a new term, the issue would be resolved. Treating someone better because of their race is also considered racist, and racism is defined as believing that individual behavior and moral character is predetermined by racial genetics.
The US provides military and economic aid to Egypt as part of the 1979 Egypt-Israel peace treaty, which has guaranteed Egypt's loyalty and friendship to the US. Without this aid, the Egyptian government would likely be overthrown by Islamists or turn to them for support. The aid is essentially a bribe to keep Egypt stable, prevent destabilization of the region, and ensure access to the Suez Canal for American ships.
Helping Assad defeat ISIS would only give power to another monster that the US would have to deal with later. By letting Assad fight ISIS and deal with a civil war, both ISIS and Assad are weakened. This approach would address the issue of ISIS without inadvertently empowering another enemy.
